                        Hi all!

Gathering, and we have an event...

                        Hi all,
Hope everyone is surviving the icy onslaught.

I just uploaded a list of Letterboxes in Tualatin Hills Park &
Recreation District parks (click on 'Files' then find 'THPRD
Letterboxes')....

                        This is almost bizarre! I know of another letterboxer of renown who also picked this

those candles. Funhog
