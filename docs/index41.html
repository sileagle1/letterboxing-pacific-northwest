we'll figure it out.

I'm the co-leader of GS Troop 2199.  Maybe you've
visited the Troop 2199 box at the dog park in
Vancouver???

Anyway, our troop of 12 girls will be planting a
series of boxes...

Hello!
 We will be vacationing in Bend next week, and I am very excited to go 
letterboxing. Wow, I can't believe how many there are in the area 
(within 30 miles). So I was just wondering if...

                        Wizbang's Mount Vernon boxes are very tricky.  They gave me a very
