                        This struck me as a good topic for discussion. What do you do to make
sure a box is hidden as well (or better) than you found it? Do you

                        Hi All,

Went out and checked on several of our boxes yesterday, in preparation for winter and 
found several boxes exposed and some not even closed properly. Just a reminder 
especially for you...

                        We are brand new to this but I am thinking that letterboxing will give us the motivation to get out and about in the winter, when otherwise we'd rather hibernate.

box throughout the winter? If so, how do you adapt?
