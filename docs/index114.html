                        will likely be OK for me.  I have a show the following weekend and

But I have my priorities.

It is tough for me to schedule anything for any weekend in June.

                        Hi -

I'd like to start letterboxing.  I'm very excited about it and am planning on spending the summer traipsing around with my 1.5yo daughter looking for stamps and finding wonderful outdoor spots....
