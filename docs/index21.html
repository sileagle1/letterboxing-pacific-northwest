                        Hey, I've heard through the grapevine that there may be clues about a 
recent heist in a newly placed letterbox. Does anyone know anything 
about a kid's favorite fairy?

Cheers!

                        To what lengths have you gone to get a letterbox?  Have you boxed in 
extremely bad weather, at night, on a super long hike, slogged through 
mud, swam a creek or larger body of water?
