                        Went on Flight Path Box hunt today - great day, great park.  Had LOTS of
trouble with finding the flight to Tokyo (tho from some of the comments,

                        Hey Mudstumpers--I think Heather replaced that stamp already--I know that she 
recarved it.  So no need to focus on those brambly-bushes; I believe you can
