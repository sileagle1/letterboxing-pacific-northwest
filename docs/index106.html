                        So, if the box is clueless, then how do you know about it? (If there are no
clues how do you post the box on the LbNA web site?)  Maybe someone can
point me to an example?

                        I definitely love the challenge of clueless (or impossible clues) 
boxes. One of the reasons I am so hooked on this sport/hobby is the 
wide variety of boxes and stamps and clues and hikes that are...

they be left on trails with some hike involved?  (How far is too far?)
Also, could they be left in spots I can't necessarily get...
