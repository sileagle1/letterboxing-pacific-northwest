will be taking a break from this board. I have so enjoyed your ideas <br>
and opinions on various matters and would like to let you know that <br>
not all people on this site feel the same way as "some folks". I am <br>
very upset that because of some of the posts that have been sent to <br>
you that they have caused you to cancel Boxapalooza. It is too bad <br>
that things like this have to ruin the enjoyment of others. I know if <br>
people could have met you and RayvenMom like I have and could see <br>
what dedicated and caring letterboxers you are, as well as wonderful <br>
new friends, I'm sure they would feel differently but I guess that is <br>
not going to happen. Thank you both for all that you have done for <br>
letterboxing and I will be visiting your Myndworks site Steve so that <br>
we can keep in touch. Best Regards,<br>
Camp Fire Lady<br>

There are a hundred reasons as to why I did it, but none of them are <br>
actually right or valid.  Again, I am sorry for having posted those <br>
words on my website and they have been erased and purged from that <br>
site. <br>

frequency of my posting and in stepping up and announcing another <br>
event in six months.  As of this moment, Boxapalooza is cancelled.<br>

perhaps one day, things will have settled down and we can start <br>
over.  In the mean time, we'll plant boxes, we'll search for other <br>
boxes and we'll maintain the website.<br>

Good grief.<br>
<br>
It's the internet Steve....get over it. Everybody isn't going to love you or what you do. So what? <br>
As far as stepping on toes, you are a rank amatuer and shouldn't even mention it. You are dealing with some pros here and your feeble toe stepping amounts to squat! Nada. You aren't even close to having the stomp down. Come back and declare yourself a toe stepper when you have a bit more experience rookie. Better yet, when you get kicked from a list you can join the club. Until then you are but a toe stomping wanna-be.<br>
<br>
So, if you are going to let a few jackasses and jerks drive you away I suggest you sell your modem.  The net is not the place for you.<br>
<br>
OTOH, just do it. LBing I mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Woof!<br>
