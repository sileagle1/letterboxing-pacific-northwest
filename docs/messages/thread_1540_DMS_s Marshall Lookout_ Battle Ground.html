over" it. That doesn't mean that I will be adopting it, just <br/>
maintaining it. It seems the rangers at Battle Ground Lake State Park <br/>
have been busy the past few weeks and one of the crucial landmarks in <br/>
the clues for this box has changed. Does anyone have any objections <br/>
if I make the slight change in the clues?<br/>

removed so the clues will need to be changed. I will be posting the <br/>
clues again with the slight change for the fence in time for the <br/>
Passport To Letterboxing Stamp Camp. There will no need for anyone to <br/>
copy the clues for the letterboxes already at Battle Ground Lake if <br/>
you will be attending the event. We will furnish them for you. See <br/>
you there!<br/>
