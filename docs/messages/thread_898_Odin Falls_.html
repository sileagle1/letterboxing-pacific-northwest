Just went out and got Odin Falls! What a beautiful place! <br/>
Funhog you always pick the most beautiful places for your<br/>
Central Oregon LBs. Loved the homemade book and the<br/>
wonderful stamp!  (got a little bonus too!!, THANKS)<br/>
Also saw a big owl! and lots of deer tracks thru the snow.<br/>
Also possibly saw some Funhog and Hubby tracks. Did<br/>
he come withyou to plant this one (or maybe it wasn't yours?)?<br/>
Thanks again Funhog! <br/>
