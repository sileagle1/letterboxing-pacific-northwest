<br/>
Just to address a couple of your questions started out carrying a <br/>
notebook with me that was about 4x6 just about half the size of your <br/>
normal every day paper.  One of the first things I noticed was that <br/>
most "journals" you would get would be just fine (like the kind you <br/>
buy at the book store or something)  However for me I noticed that <br/>
with a wire bound notebook the wire would bend and my pages would <br/>
tear.  So I then cut all my images out and moved into a notebook of <br/>
about the same size but hard bound instead of wire bound.  My next <br/>
mistake was that the notebook I bought had blue pages, the ink colors <br/>
didn't look quite so good and I didn't always get the image I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Now granted I am pickier about images than the average person I <br/>
suppose because those upside down images REALLY drive me nuts.<br/>
<br/>
What I ended up doing then was carrying around index cards with me <br/>
when letterboxing, it saved on space and I could make sure to get the <br/>
perfect image before adding it to my logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Then at some events I saw some of the really neat scrap booking sort <br/>
of thing that some others were doing and I thought that was just <br/>
awesome.  Adding photos of where they had been letterboxing and <br/>
such.  <br/>
<br/>
So this Christmas Iron`Bear bought me a very large leather bound <br/>
scrapbook.  It is the size of a photo album and has some really fancy <br/>
sheer cover sheets for each individual page.  I think it is <br/>
beautiful.  What I am now planning to done of these days is <br/>
surgically remove my images from my old logbook and transplant them <br/>
into this new scrapbook along with all the recent images I have <br/>
collected on the index cards. I figure when it is finally done it <br/>
will make a beautiful coffee table book that invites tons of <br/>
discussion when we have company.<br/>
<br/>
However I probably won't be bringing it to many events because I <br/>
won't want it to get damaged in travel.  (I'm not sure though, I <br/>
suppose it depends on the schedule of events and what type of <br/>
gathering it was)<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts from someone that has taken a long time to figure <br/>
out how they really wanted to do their letterbox logbook.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
To address your other question, the size of your stamp totally <br/>
depends on you. Your average logbook is about the size of an index <br/>
card.  One of those little mead notebooks seems to be the run of the <br/>
mill.  However lots of people use different size logbooks in each <br/>
letterbox depending on the location.  I for example rarely plant a <br/>
large letterbox and often do homemade logbooks that around about 2x3 <br/>
 my microboxes tend to have even smaller logbooks, and my hitchhikers <br/>
too, sometimes as small as 1x1.  What I ended up doing was creating <br/>
my image the size and shape I wanted it to be and for a long time <br/>
when I would find a letterbox that has a logbook that my entire stamp <br/>
wouldn't fit in I just use a portion of the stamp, (the head for <br/>
example) After awhile I decided to just have two stamps one that I <br/>
carry around as a "Traveler" that is much smaller than my normal <br/>
signature stamp that I use to stamp in if the logbook is smaller and <br/>
then my normal signature stamp itself.  I don't exchange the second <br/>
one in signature stamp exchanges however. But if someone knows to ask <br/>
me for "a little bit of chaos" then they get that image too, as a <br/>
Traveler in their logbook.<br/>
<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
On a final note  I just thought I would mention that I think there <br/>
is already a "Wild Woman" in the local area and I am not sure if that <br/>
will ruffle any feathers or not, but you may want to ask about it on <br/>
the local list  I have never ran into two letter boxers using the <br/>
same handle before, but I know I would be a little upset if there was <br/>
another person using the name "pandora" in the local area but I may <br/>
be way wrong. <br/>
And just in case anyone is reading this that likes to give me a hard <br/>
time, (namely you Ryan) then signing in as pandora at your next <br/>
letterbox would probably be an irritating thing to do to say the <br/>
least.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well, <br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm getting my tools ready to begin this fascinating hobby of <br/>
letterboxing,<br/>
&gt; and I'm starting with making my logbook that I carry with me. What <br/>
size do<br/>
&gt; most of you use? Or maybe a better question would be, what size are <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; stamps typically that are placed in the letterboxes? Also, I have <br/>
drawn out<br/>
&gt; the pattern to carve my personal stamp--THE WILD WOMAN! But she may <br/>
be too<br/>
&gt; big, so I'd again appreciate an average size of the log books kept <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help.<br/>
