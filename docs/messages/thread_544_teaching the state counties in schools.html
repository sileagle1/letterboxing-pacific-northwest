                    <div class="plaintext-content">I grew up in NC (North Carolina) and NC has 100 counties and I had to <br>
learn them all in 6th or 7th grade. (we learned them alphabetically <br>
and I can still remember the 1st 20 or so...plus the ones I have <br>
lived in! :-)<br>
But I think NC had more than enough State history etc taught in the <br>
Public Schools. I remember concentrating on NC History every year up <br>
until Sophmore, Junior and Senior. Any History we talked about we <br>
talked about NC's role in the settlement of the country, the <br>
revolutionary war, and the civil war. I know volumes of NC History. <br>
