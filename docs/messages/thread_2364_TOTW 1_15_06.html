                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll have to say that letterboxing taught me something about myself<br/>
that I absolutely did not know before I took up the hobby. I had no<br/>
idea that I had any ability in the arts of any kind. My drawings look<br/>
like a grade schooler to me and I had NEVER carved a rubber stamp in<br/>
my life. <br/>
<br/>
When I first took Speedball tool to soft block, I was totally hooked.<br/>
I found out that even those elementary drawings can translate into a<br/>
stamp image that's fun to look at. My skills have defintely improved<br/>
in the carving department and I now prefer to use an Xacto knife and<br/>
needle tools but those early stamps represent the beginning of a craft<br/>
that I still enjoy immensely and hope will stay with me for many years<br/>
to come! I find that totally inspiring. Funhog<br/>
