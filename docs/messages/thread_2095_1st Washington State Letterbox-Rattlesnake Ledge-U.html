Bend, WA. Rattlesnake Ledge was the first letterbox in the state of <br>
Washington and I had not been there since I found it in April of <br>
2001! It was my very first letterbox find. <br>
<br>
In 2003, "the powers that be" rerouted the Rattlesnake Ledge trail <br>
and it is no longer just one and a half miles! It is now 2 miles to <br>
the Ledge. However, it is much more of a gradual incline and a <br>
definite improvement over when I went up  in 2001!! I only had to <br>
rest twice on the climb up and when we got there I actually said to <br>
Ryan "We're Already Here! Wow!"<br>
<br>
I had carved a "replacement" stamp for the Rattlesnake Ledge box <br>
because I had heard talk from other letterboxers that the stamp had <br>
cracked into pieces. I was going to add it to the original box and <br>
leave the pieces in there as well! (For historical interest). When <br>
Ryan and I got to the top and started hunting for the box, we found <br>
that the snag that had held the letterbox was now a stump and the <br>
upper half had fallen over. The rotten wood was broken into many <br>
pieces. We sifted through some of the wreckage thinking that we might <br>
come across the box, but no luck. Since we had also carved some <br>
additional rattlesnakes to hide on our own (which would have put 3 <br>
letterboxes on this trail!) we had an extra letterbox with us. We <br>
also had my "replacement" stamp with us as well! So we hid a <br>
letterbox in the original location. The snag is now a stump and the <br>
letterbox is hidden underneath rocks and debris at the base of a pine <br>
behind the stump. It contains the "replacement" stamp and Ryan's <br>
rattlesnake stamp. <br>
<br>
Ryan continued to hike 9 and 1/2 miles to Snoqualmie along the <br>
Rattlesnake Mountain Trail. I returned down the Rattlesnake Ledge <br>
Trail to the car (and to hide my Lazy Rattlesnake Box). I then had to <br>
drive over to Snoquamie (exit 27 off I-90) and pick him up where the <br>
Rattlesnake Mountain trail comes out! Be glad he didn't hide his <br>
Rattlesnake, or you all could have been subjected to a possible 9 <br>
mile hike!! :-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">FUN!  Now I have something new to attack on Rattlesnake :><br>
<br>
I ended up on the top of Little Si (missing the "Ah, Little Si" box<br>
entirely, not because it was hard to find, but because I didn't realize<br>
it was up there -- yea, my bad) planting a new box from Rhode Island up<br>
there.  Clues to come, but it's on the lower lookout -- the original box<br>
is on the upper look out.<br>
<br>
This one is a 5 mile round trip, some rock and root scrambling, and some<br>
very nice rock climbing off to the side, should one be so inclined.<br>
<br>
"Little Si among the ferns" will have clues posted soon (maybe even<br>
today if I get my act together) -- so you'll have 2 to hunt at the top<br>
of that lovely climb :>.<br>
<br>
It's definitely a 2-water bottle hike though...<br>
