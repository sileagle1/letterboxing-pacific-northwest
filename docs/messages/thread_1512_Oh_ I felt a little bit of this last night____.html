First of all, I'm a Newbie and I treasure every box I<br>
find and leave it in the same state I found it along<br>
with my stamp.  Every box I've found since I started<br>
two weeks ago was in tact, hidden well, and I returned<br>
the favor.  And then yesterday I retrieved the Lacamas<br>
Creek box, which was orphaned, to restore it and that<br>
is complete and ready to be replanted with a few<br>
surprises inside.  So I know I don't fall into the<br>
category below of "newbie's". Sigh.  <br>
<br>
However, I want to express my disdain when I went to<br>
find the "Letterbox Where Are You" last night.  I was<br>
trucking through the dog park at 8:30 p.m. (which,<br>
after the whole scenario at Hamburger Hamburger<br>
Cheeseburger you think I wouldn't have done this<br>
alone, but I did).  Anyway, I got out of my Monday<br>
night final exam REALLY early...rescued Lacamas Creek<br>
then headed to the dog park in Vancouver.  Was able to<br>
stamp in at two books my children had already stamped<br>
in at...however, when going to get the third one,<br>
which was OUR FIRST ONE to find...it was GONE!  I was<br>
hurt.  It was dark and I searched forever only to<br>
realize it's gone.  Got home, went online and sure<br>
enough, the placer says the box had been vandalized. <br>
Now WHO would do that?  I thought only letterboxers<br>
look at the sights and find the clues...then I<br>
realized, with so much advertising lately that anyone<br>
can go on the site and read the clues and be<br>
malicious.<br>
<br>
Very Sad.  I left the Dog Park feeling empty because<br>
I'd missed out on a VERY COOL stamp.<br>
<br>
I agree with you Pandora...the lack of respect is<br>
showing up in our hobby.<br>
<br>
I do have to ask one question...what is GEOCACHING??? <br>
I read the article about the tube under the bridge and<br>
the bomb squad but I don't understand what it is.  Can<br>
anyone of the PACNWLB answer this questions.<br>

Missing boxes are nothing new....  my poor departed Rock Creek #1 box was <br>
stolen, returned, defaced and stolen again, all in the first year of its life....  This <br>
was in 1999.<br>
<br>
You certainly sound sincere in your letterboxing efforts.  Don't let all of us old <br>
schoolers get you down.  In the beginning we were all trying to figure out how <br>
to do this.<br>
<br>
In regards to adopting letterboxes,  I choose to consider them as an interactive <br>
art piece.  The artist may have carved a stamp, created clues and hidden the <br>
box in a very artful manner.   If I am in charge of someone else's art, my duty is <br>
to change as little as possible.  If the box and stamp are missing, then it is my <br>
job to replace them in as similar a situation as I can.  When that is not possible, <br>
then IMHO, that box ought to be retired.<br>
<br>
Box adoptions are a fairly new phenomenon.  Some sort of accepted protocol is <br>
needed so misunderstandings are less common.<br>

<br>
Lily I am sorry you seemed to get smacked for this hitch hiker thing -- I<br>
think it was a matter of wording. With the entire recent letterbox getting<br>
lost to geocachers the idea of "trinkets" in a box sounds to most of us like<br>
little McDonald toys. -- There is nothing wrong with leaving a hitch hiker<br>
in any box, although if you fit one into that little tiny box I am just<br>
amazed!<br>
<br>
My biggest concern from go was that you were going to do something with a<br>
historical box that got everyone else made at you and left you feeling<br>
attacked, I'm sorry it's turned out this way.  <br>
<br>
Again I suggest leaving that box as close to original as possible. Less we<br>
all start having a coronary again.<br>

<br>
Ah, well, sorry about that.  Misunderstandings are bound to happen <br>
occasionally, and there's nothing wrong with putting a hitchhiker in <br>
the box.<br>
<br>
Many people DO include 'trinkets' with their boxes, and from your <br>
post, that's what it sounded like you had done.  Hitchhikers are as <br>
old as the DMS boxers and you won't find anyone complaining if that's <br>
the only thing you're putting into it.<br>
<br>
Carry on!  =)  Sorry for the misunderstanding!  We're just trying to <br>
help.  (May not seem that way at times, but it's true!)<br>
