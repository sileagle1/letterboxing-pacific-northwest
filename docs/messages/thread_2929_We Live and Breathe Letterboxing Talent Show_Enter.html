Letterboxing Event in Oregon in September and you and/or your family or <br/>
a group of you have a very cool skit, talent, camp song, silly dance, <br/>
play an instrument, etc. that you would like to share with everyone <br/>
during the Friday night campfire with smores and entertainment, please <br/>
contact Camp Fire Lady through Atlas Quest or at tinarie@msn.com. We <br/>
hope to have some very talented letterboxers show their hidden talents <br/>
and this would be the venue to do just that. Hope to see you there!<br/>
