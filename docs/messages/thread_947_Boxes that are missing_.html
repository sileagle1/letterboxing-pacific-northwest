                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sure this question has been asked and answered a zillion times, but I'm going to ask it one more time.  Is there a place one can go to find out what boxes are missing?  There are some on the letterboxing.org site that don't say they are missing, but folks later confirm that they are (Battleground Lake #2 for example).  Is there a comprehensive list of confirmed missing boxes in the PNW?<br/>
