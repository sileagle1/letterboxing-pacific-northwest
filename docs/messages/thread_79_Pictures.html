Here are some pictures taken early morning at McLane Creek.<br/>

The Wood Ducks were at the extreme edge of my zoom capabilities and are not as<br/>
clear as I like, but you can still make out what they are.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, Froggy left his mark in my book.  Nice stamp, one of the best I <br/>
have seen of yours so far :0)  Found some Sunshine 'faring well' <br/>
too.  It was great to get out there again.  <br/>
<br/>
Incidently, I met a woman in Arizona back in early March, (a <br/>
salesperson in one of those souvenier stores in Tombstone of all <br/>
places) who is from Bothell.  As a young girl her father owned a <br/>
demolition company that tore down the ghost town of Bordeaux not far <br/>
from McLane Creek.  Funny that I would meet this woman in Tombstone <br/>
but that is life I suppose.  She told me the story of how when her <br/>
father was doing the demo work on the buildings in that small town <br/>
that she would go around behind the men and pick out nails from the <br/>
lumber.  WWII was going on and there were lots of people recycling <br/>
metals for the war effort. I had heard of the town but didnt really <br/>
know anything about it until I returned to Wa.  I did some research <br/>
and found that there was a logging railroad that ran from Tenino thru <br/>
the Mima Prarie area and on thru the town of Bordeaux which was the <br/>
home of a logging company and on to Mud Bay.  The boardwalk trail <br/>
that serves as the 'short cut' around the beaver ponds at McLane <br/>
creek are actually part of that old railroad bed.  I think that with <br/>
all the history in that area and the chance meeting of the woman in <br/>
AZ and the incidental fact that my name is Nail, there is a good <br/>
chance that there will be a new letterbox series coming out soon.  <br/>
Keep your eyes peeled, boxes may begin hiding in that area soon.<br/>
