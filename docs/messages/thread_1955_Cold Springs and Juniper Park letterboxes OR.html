Oh, how sad! The Cold Springs Box was a favorite of mine...<br/>
The clue was great and the hiding place lovely. Juniper <br/>
Park was on my list of must-finds for my next trip over <br/>
the mountain. I'm so sorry that these boxes are MIA. <br/>
<br/>
On another note, I placed two new letterboxes last <br/>
weekend at Tumalo SP. I'll do my best to get the clues<br/>
up and running during the next week or so. Spring has <br/>
defintely peeked out from under a rock over in the <br/>
center of our wonderful state. It's the perfect time to<br/>
do those hikes that can sometimes cause your brain<br/>
to fry in the middle of summer!  Funhog<br/>

&gt;   The Cold Springs and Juniper Park letterboxes have gone missing. <br/>
