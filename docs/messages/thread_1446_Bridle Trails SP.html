                    <div class="plaintext-content">Happy to report that my 8 BTSP boxes are alive and well , as is the <br>
original (9th) box<br>
<br>
I tried to adopt this box during the Great Change Over and it was all <br>
for naught, the original clues are gone.<br>
<br>
I have updated my clues to include the box and will be revisiting the <br>
Rattlesnake Ledge box to make sure our Original State box is back on <br>
the national list.<br>
<br>
For those that tried and failed on the BTSP boxes, I have tweeked the <br>
clues in places to make them a bit more user friendly and account for <br>
some changes in the park.  I still consider the clues moderately <br>
challenging for a novice boxer.  The big challenge is the lack of <br>
navigation aids, except trail junctions.<br>
<br>
For our California visitor, Bridle Trails is just north of the 520 / <br>
405 junction on the city limits of Bellevue / Kirkland.  I hope you <br>
pay a visit.  Nine boxes waiting for you.<br>
<br>
Good Luck to All<br>
<br>
