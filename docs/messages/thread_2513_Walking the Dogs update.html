&gt;Hi All, <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am new to this group, and have a question. I am running an elective for my daughter's middle school on letterboxing.  They made their own books, then carved their own stamps, and now for two weeks we are going to letterboxing sites near their school in central Seattle.  The first week we went to the two boxes in the Arboretum.  They were beautiful, and the girls had a great time following the directions and finding the boxes.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow we are going to "Now and Then" in Seward Park.  I went this <br/>
past weekend to check out the two boxes that are supposed to be there.  <br/>
It is a beautiful walk through some old growth forest, but I couldn't <br/>
find the first box.  Apparently the books had been switched out about a <br/>
month ago, and the second box was there, so I just can't imagine the <br/>
first one isn't there.  I know I found the right spot (stump with a <br/>
baby  cedar).  Has anyone else been there and found the first box?  The <br/>
stump has so many little nooks, I thought perhaps I missed it.  I <br/>
e-mailed the person at the address they left on the site, but haven't <br/>
gotten a response.  Any advice on where the box is in that stump would <br/>
be most appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks<br/>
<br/>
