Hello Portland letterboxers,<br>
<br>
Has anyone heard about the "questing" project scheduled for Forest Park tomorrow?<br>
I just found about it through some geocaching friends who were wondering how <br>
many geocaches and letterboxes this "quest" would unearth....<br>
<br>
Is anyone on here registered for this?  Sorry for the long link...<br>

Description:  Quest in Forest Park! Help create a treasure hunt within the trails of <br>
Forest Park, the country's largest naturally forested urban park. Volunteers will walk a <br>
trail, creating a map of landmarks along the way. Volunteers will return to <br>
headquarters bringing ideas of how to quest or create a treasure hunt on the trail <br>
using natural clues and even riddles. There are several trails throughout the park that <br>
will be part of the end result: a treasure map to be published for park visitors. Be a <br>
part of this exciting adventure! This project is perfect for families  kids can help <br>
create memorable riddles using the crooked trees and sword ferns that they <br>
encounter along the way  just to name a few!              <br>

Hmmm... I just wrote to the project director and asked for more information. If this is <br>
based on the Valley Quest project in Vermont it could be entirely OK. However, I too <br>
am concerned about the dozens of letterboxes that might be in jeopardy if uncaring <br>
folks stumbled on them. If I learn anything of interest, I'll surely pass it on. Many <br>
thanks for the headsup. Funhog<br>

Oh, man, I so want to go to this!  If I had more than 12 hours<br>
advanced warning, I might even have done it.  Please, if anyone has<br>
signed up, tell us about it!  =)<br>
