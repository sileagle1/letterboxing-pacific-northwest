Letterbox now is proud to display the Sign of the Hog, it's first <br/>
actual signature stamp! Granted, a couple of groups of hikers found <br/>
the box and signed the book this last spring but mine is the very <br/>
first official visit by a letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is a remote box but... the hike is wonderful; there are two <br/>
places to camp within a dozen miles AND this is an early oevre, not <br/>
exactly what the Green Turtle is producing of late. I consider it a <br/>
collectible. This box was hidden in May, 2001 B.A.(Before Amanda)So <br/>
if you have a hankering to get to a Ryan box before Nancy Drew's <br/>
image graces a page, this is your chance. Funhog<br/>

Holy COW!  That box is STILL THERE?!  I figured it was SURE to have <br/>
gone missing by now over three years later.  It was one of the first <br/>
boxes I planted, and in hindsite I didn't think it was an especially <br/>
safe location.<br/>
<br/>
Dang dabbit, Funhog, you never cease to surprise me!  =)  Thanks for <br/>
the update!  It is a pretty nice hike!<br/>
