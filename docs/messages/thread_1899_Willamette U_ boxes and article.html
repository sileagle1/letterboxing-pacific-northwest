Hey, <br/>
<br/>
I've been kind of out of the loop for a while, since I'm actually<br/>
doing schoolwork and stuff.  However, I thought I'd point you to this<br/>
article that appeared in the Willamette University paper yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
http://wucollegian.collegepublisher.com/news/2005/<br/>
02/02/News/A.ModernDay.Treasure.Hunt-849076.shtml<br/>
<br/>
The article itself is fine, but the WU box that has had it's picture<br/>
taken and printed is already missing.  As a result, Wizbang and I have<br/>
pulled our other boxes from around campus, except the Little<br/>
Frustration box, which is presumed safe because anyone that takes the<br/>
time to solve that clue is probably a serious letterboxer.  As far as<br/>
I know, there aren't any more surviving boxes on campus.  <br/>
<br/>
We plan to rehide the boxes and rewrite the clues, and I will be<br/>
writing an editorial to the paper to complain and hopefully do a<br/>
little bit of explaining about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd give a heads up to anyone in the Salem area.  <br/>

Rats!<br/>
<br/>
As an alum, I was looking forward to an excuse to drag my family to <br/>
the campus when we come down to LB camp this summer at Silver Falls. <br/>
I do hope you find a way to replant!<br/>

What a major drag! Those were really fun boxes. Plus, anyone who took the time to <br/>
get them usually got an exchange oppportunity thrown in since you two always <br/>
offered to tag along. I know you just wanted to get a good chuckle as we fumbled <br/>
around, but still... I do hope the boxes find new homes soon since I haven't found <br/>
them all yet. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I didn't get the news article when I cut and pasted the URL into my <br/>
browser. I only got an 'article not found' message on my screeen. Funhog<br/>
