cow".  Just looked at it again with the info about Heyokah Man, and <br>
I still think "holy cow" but I think I have a little bit of a clue.<br>
<br>
I want to give a Thank You to Heyokah Man to for being the first <br>
finder of my "Bad Hair Day" Box that had been lonely and waiting <br>
since August.<br>
<br>
Happy Boxing:)<br>
