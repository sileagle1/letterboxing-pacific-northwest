                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I took my cousin, new to letterboxing, out today to search for A<br>
Wonderful Tour. We did all our research before heading out and it paid off.<br>
We didn't manage to find any of the boxes, but found the land marks for<br>
boxes two and three. We had to call off the search at box 3 due to a<br>
previous appointment. Has anyone found these boxes lately? I'm curious if<br>
they're still in place. We're positive we were in the right place for boxes<br>
2 and 3 but couldn't locate the actual box.<br>

These clues are particularly evil. I haven't found all of them <br>
either and haven't been by to check on the ones whose <br>
locations do I know. When the rest of the Traveling Circus <br>
get back to town this summer, we'll have to make a point <br>
of checking up on them. I do know that the final one by <br>
Windairen is long gone, it's hiding place is toast but I'd be <br>
surprised if the first one is gone. Funhog<br>

Windairen and her boyfriend, Wizbang, make particularly difficult <br>
clues.  A friend and I attempted three of his in one day and found <br>
nothing.  We tried it again the second and still had no luck.  We even <br>
got help from him while in the field and couldn't find them.  I think <br>
all three of those in Mount Vernon, WA are actually missing, though <br>
that status has not been posted on letterboxing.org.  I did manage to <br>
find his Mini Cooper box in Estacada, OR, though!  Very exciting, <br>
indeed.<br>
