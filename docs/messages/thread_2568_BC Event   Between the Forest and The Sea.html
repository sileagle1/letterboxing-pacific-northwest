                    <div class="plaintext-content">finally I figured out how to get back to this board. We have had major<br/>
computer renovations and I wasn't able to get to LBNA boards, just<br/>
Atlasquest. But alas. tonight, hooray, I made it back here.<br/>
<br/>
Posted a new event/gathering for B.C.<br/>
<br/>
This is our first event ever, so feel very much a rookie.<br/>
I didnt even know if there is a 'proper' way to list events here.<br/>
Was really feeling frustrated that each event we had planned on<br/>
possibly attending fell through, not so easy when <br/>
1. hubby isnt a 'keen' letterboxer<br/>
2. getting 'permission' to take my daughter across the border with<br/>
only one parent(ME) hasn't been easy, silly ex husbands.<br/>
So I finally said, "aha! we need to have an event here!<br/>
Hoping to plant and replant some missing boxes.<br/>
Hope to see some of you here.<br/>
Any tips would be helpful!<br/>
thanks<br/>
<br/>
Stargazers sounded excellent!!<br/>

You know, it was funny, but when we were in London at one point,<br/>
Princess Lea and I were able to get a Wi-Fi signal with our laptops<br/>
and for some mysterious reason, both of us were only able to get AQ.<br/>
That was the ONLY website we could find and connect to. I tried places<br/>
like Yahoo or even Google.co.uk but nothing. AQ, miracles of miracles,<br/>
was the only site to keep getting through.<br/>
<br/>
Lea wanted to know how I pulled that off, and I could only shake my<br/>
head and say, "I wish I knew." Very weird....<br/>
<br/>
But of all the websites I could access, I was rather pleased it was AQ. =)<br/>

well of course Ryan, I would guess most parents like to be able to<br/>
stay connected with their kids while overseas (wink)<br/>
<br/>
Just in the process of replanting some of our boxes out here that went<br/>
missing (not sure how to post clues, as we do not want these to go<br/>
missing prior to the event) Also ready to plant a couple more. Yippee.<br/>
Wanting to get my hands on some good carving material to carve some<br/>
'big' stamps. After seeing some of the gorgeous travelling event<br/>
stamps from a Washington event ..wow! what an inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
AQ link for this event is:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=184<br/>
Now I hope this is proper to list this link here???<br/>
If not let me know<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some of you here.<br/>
