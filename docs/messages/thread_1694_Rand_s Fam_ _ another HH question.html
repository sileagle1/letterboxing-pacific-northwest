Here are some weird things that I stumbled upon this past week.  <br>
Whilst letterboxing up the 'coast' on our trek to BC for the recent <br>
gathering, we found several letterboxes but also found 3 geocaches <br>
along the way (mostly Whatcom Cty, WA).  Within these caches we <br>
found one complete Hitchhiker Letterbox and 2 partials (stamps <br>
only).  One was the stamp to 'Farewell Daylight' a HH that we found <br>
a couple of years ago and are fairly certain that 'Rand's Fam' from <br>
either West Linn or Lake Oswego, Oregon launched it.  Anyways, I <br>
retrieved the stamp and am seeking guidance as to what I should do <br>
with it.  I can put together a new Hitchhiker kit for it and send it <br>
on its merry way if that's what Rand's Fam would like--otherwise, <br>
please send me guidance.<br>
<br>
Another stamp we retrieved was one that I did not recognize--but I'm <br>
assuming it's either a stamp to a HH Letterbox or a 'resident' <br>
letterbox somewhere.  It's an image of a question mark surrounded by <br>
a circle.  It's about 0.5"x1" and seems to be carved in the <br>
white 'buttery' Mars Carve material--although the thinner stuff not <br>
the 'thick chunk'.  If anybody recognizes this stamp/knows where it <br>
belongs I could send it your way.  If not, I'll convert it to a HH <br>
and send it on its way, as well.<br>
<br>
Odd...<br>

Yes, that one is ours.  How sad!  It was our very first box.  I guess we'll <br>
have to decide what we want to do with it, I'll let you know.  Thanks for <br>
"saving" it!<br>
