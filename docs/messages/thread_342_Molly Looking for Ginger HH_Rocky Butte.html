There are only about 5 blank pages left in your logbook.  Molly even managed to stamp in.  The logbook almost couldn't hold the big girl! <br/>

If Bobby or someone else wants to "retrieve" her in Vernonia and return her back out there again, that would be a great idea.  We really enjoyed seeing the signatures from back east that go with familiar names from the talk page.<br/>

I'll post when we have droped her off. So that she can come back for the gathering. <br/>

That would make a great 'bookend' to her travels. She started at a <br/>
gathering back East!<br/>
