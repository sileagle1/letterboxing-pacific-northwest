                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was excited to hear that our "Gorge Panorama" box is still alive!  I <br>
got a message from someone who found it yesterday and they said it was <br>
their FIRST find.  We hid the box when vacationing out there in AUG <br>
2005 and had only received one message (in NOV 2005) about the box. <br>
<br>
We have another box in WA that we hid in SEP 2007 that we haven't <br>
heard anything about (Beaver Totem), AND a box in Oregon that we hid <br>
in SEP 2005 (Mountain Tourists) that we've never had any info on, even <br>
though it has been in place for over 1.5 years.<br>
<br>
If any of you find these boxes, I'd LOVE to hear if they are still <br>
OK.  We're used to getting finders a lot sooner in our state, so am <br>
wondering if anyone has looked for these boxes or not.  <br>

We got SOOOOO close last summer and then ran out of daylight.  :(  <br>
It'll be at least 5 years before we can get back to try again...  :(  <br>
Then again that wasn't the first or the last letterbox that we were <br>
practically on top of last summer that we missed out on.  Another one <br>
was down in SE Oregon that we didn't realize we were within 200m of <br>
until we drove another 500 miles NE that day.  Talk about major DOH <br>
moment.  They come more frequently now...  And then yet another one in <br>
Wyoming... :(  And prolly a bunch of other states we passed through, as <br>
well.  I could care less about the first finder part of it--it was just <br>
the thought of the opportunity to find yet another awesome Don & Gwen <br>
box that made us want to seek it out.<br>

Just wait until you qualify for a Golden Age Pass then you might not <br>
even know when you are having a senior moment. At least you hit <br>
Dumbledore's before you vacated Oregon.<br>
