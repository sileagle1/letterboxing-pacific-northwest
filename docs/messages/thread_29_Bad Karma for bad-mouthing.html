indiscretion about a Mapsurfer stamp. I was out hiding a letterbox on <br/>
this absolutely gorgeous day in Seattle!! Unfortunately, the trails <br/>
were a quagmire of mud! I was trying to step carefully...but the mud <br/>
grabbed my shoe and held on to it. My foot came out of my shoe and I <br/>
lost my balance. Mud everywhere. Hmmmm. And to add to my humiliation <br/>
I now encounter several people on what WAS an empty trail. There were <br/>
no cars in the parking lot when I arrived!! Where did these people <br/>
come from?  Did I mention that my Mud Bath occurred 2 miles away from <br/>
the car. (sigh) It was a very squishy trek back to the car. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Well, I am dying to know which one is was.  "Butt ugly", I'm<br/>
afraid, does not narrow the field too much ... (of course, I've<br/>
had at least one of my boxes replaced by someone else, so there's <br/>
no proof its _my_ butt ugly work ... :-) )<br/>

&gt; And to add to my humiliation I now encounter several people on <br/>

_They_, I'm afraid, were the spies.  I'm just a humble PNW letterboxer <br/>
(P4F0) (and have no comment on the rumors that they were responsible<br/>
for importing some of that alleged "least coast mud" to your trails ;-))<br/>
