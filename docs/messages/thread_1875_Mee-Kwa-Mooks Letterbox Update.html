the Mee-Kwa-Mooks letterbox in West Seattle. It seems someone had found the<br/>
letterbox and trashed it. The kind person  who found the remains, hid them.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to fetch the handmade logbook and more importantly the stamp.<br/>
The logbook was soaked to the bone. But since it was hand-made from<br/>
watercolor paper, it held up quite well. Folks who used waterproof ink<br/>
should know that their stamped images are just fine. However some inks used<br/>
ran and smeared with the wet conditions.<br/>
<br/>
I am drying out the logbook and hope to return it to the park if it passes<br/>
muster. I will be creating a new hiding place for it as the last place<br/>
seems to have been found out by the local knuckleheads.<br/>
<br/>
I adapted this letterbox last year and feel poorly about what happened.<br/>
This is the first LB under my care to be vandalized. Dang...<br/>
<br/>
Until further notice, Mee-Kwa-Mooks is on holiday.<br/>
