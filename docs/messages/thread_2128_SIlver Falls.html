<br>
Thank you all, for a delightful weekend.  DB and I finally rolled into our Spokane driveway about  8:00PM.  We especially enjoyed putting faces to some of our favorite box planters and posters.  A special 'thankyou'  to DMS and Funhog for the impromptu carving tutorial, although I must say, waiting in the woods for DB to re-create it in all it's 4 color wonder did try my patience!  :)  The doughnuts were great, perhaps the best we'd ever had!<br>
<br>
We were struck as we drove back, at the spectacular beauty of Silver Falls, thanks Brett, for picking such a great spot, the generous enthusiasm that welcomed us, good food and of course, great company!  I also think I've uncovered another layer of letterboxing...watch out Spokane, the game just gets better and better!<br>
