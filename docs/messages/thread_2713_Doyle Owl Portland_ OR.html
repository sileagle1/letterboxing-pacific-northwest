years in place it went missing this fall and I finally got around to<br/>
putting it back. The clue has changed slightly but the stamp is the<br/>
same. Even though my carving skills have improved with time, I figured<br/>
it was only proper to reproduce this stamp in its original "primitive"<br/>
style. Go for it! Funhog<br/>
