We tediously decoded Ryan's Walking Tour clues, and inspite of a few errors, got firsties in his log.  The stamp is beautiful,  which made the; 4 trips into town, hours of counting and decoding, and rerunning thru a few inconsistancies to figure out what he did, worth the effort.  We cannot tell you how we are looking forward to Turtle Soup!<br/>
<br/>
We also attempted Silver Falls, it was snowing like the begewdies on Saturday, so we only got one box, we were soaked all the way thru, with the help of a snowball fight and the photo ops were great!  <br/>
