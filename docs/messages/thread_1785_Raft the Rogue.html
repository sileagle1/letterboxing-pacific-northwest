&gt; Our plans are to add letterboxes to the river coridor on our next trip <br/>
&gt; on the Rogue so a short cut probably won't help that much anyway.I <br/>
&gt; did write a note on the clue sheet for those that are looking for <br/>
&gt; Paradise. The best way to nab these two letterboxes is via raft.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, do tell! When are you doing this? I have always wanted to raft the Rogue and hike <br/>
it back. Wouldn't this be the perfect time for Erfellie to organize her shindig? The <br/>
Hog's wheels are turning... <br/>

A private river trip on the Rogue wild &amp; scenic section requires a <br/>
permit, and sometimes the permit is difficult to get. It is set up <br/>
in a lottery draw. If anyone is interested in sending away for the <br/>
river permit we might be able to figure out how we could manage to <br/>
get some folks down river in inflatable Kayaks. We wouldn't want to <br/>
do less than a 4 or 5 day trip. I would just have to find some other <br/>
guides to help with support gear boats. The river itself is a fairly <br/>
easy river with only one class 4 at Blossom Bar, that is if you <br/>
portage Rainey Falls. If someone needs the permit address I can look <br/>
it up and post it here later. If anyone wanted to do a commercial <br/>
trip, a stop at Paradise is usually in the schedule.<br/>

You can also raft the rogue without having your own personal permit <br/>
by hiring river guides. Rogue Wilderness Inc. located in Merlin, OR <br/>
specializes in rafting trips of the wild and scenic regions of the <br/>
Rogue but I think it can be upwards of a 100$ a day so it can get <br/>
awfully expensive to hire a guide for a 4 or 5 day trip but for those <br/>
who have the money just laying around waiting to be spent (ha!) it <br/>
might be an idea. <br/>
Ryan, your reply about the shortcut to Paradise make me laugh like <br/>
crazy and I immediatly had to call Sandi (my LB sidekick) and read it <br/>
to her. I am sorry to hear about your blisters :o/ but happy to know <br/>
your healed. When I read in the log book that you had hiked the 24 <br/>
miles I was amazed, I recall vaguely someone saying "Ryan is a hiking <br/>
stud" and it must be true, I would die on a hike that long! Just the <br/>
6 miles made my hips hurt for 3 days, but it was worth it. I am <br/>
amazed you did all that in ONE day, you must be in extremely good <br/>
health! I am in good health too and young, but several years of judo <br/>
caused some injuries to my hips and so some letterboxes I just can't <br/>
make the hike :o( I bought William Sullivans book you reccomended on <br/>
one of your web pages, 100 hikes in Southern Oregon, GREAT book! <br/>
Highly reccomendt it to anyone who lives in the area. I've been here <br/>
my whole life and was still amazed by the all the trails in here I <br/>
never knew existed :o) Thanks Ryan!<br/>

I think commercial raft trips in the Wild and Scenic section run <br/>
closer to $200 per day for a 3 day trip. You don't do any of the <br/>
cooking or other chores, so if you want a laid back trip it is a <br/>
winner. Private trips on the otherhand cost about $100 for the <br/>
entire trip, but everyone shares the work.<br/>

<br/>
*laughing*  That's pretty funny.  On the AT, I could pound out 24<br/>
miles without much trouble at all--even carry a heavy backpack over<br/>
far more rugged terrain.  But I definitely wasn't conditioned for a 24<br/>
mile hike at that particular time!  Pain, lots of pain....<br/>
<br/>
I'd have a tough time doing 24 miles at the moment as well.  <br/>
