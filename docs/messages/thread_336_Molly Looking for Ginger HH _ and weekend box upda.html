The obvious rock was flipped away from a hole in the ground and we searched the whole area.  We enjoyed our visit anyway.  Please advise if we missed the box somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, we found and were 1st to log into the beautifully carved Sitka Spruce on the way to Cannon Beach.  There is a geocache nearby.  We happened upon it 1st, the letterbox almost alluded us.  We were looking for younger trees, ha ha.<br/>
<br/>
Then we headed for the Cannon Beach box and we were also 1st to log in, Waawho!  Who do ya think we found but Molly herself, well her stamp anyway.  My what a big girl!  She and Tara hit it off pretty well, so she is gonna visit Portland a bit and then head on to look for Ginger.  Please let us know if there are any particulars about getting Molly to her destination, she is having fun, but I think she is anxious to see Ginger. <br/>
<br/>
We were also able to catch the  Ecola Monsterous Fish box and the nearby geocache led us to it.  The geocache was quite visible (and still is a bit).  We did what we could to hide it better, but we were in the open and discretion was not much of an option.  <br/>
<br/>
All boxes we found were in great shape and we made sure they were well hidden.  Especially the ones near geocaches.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all again for such a fun way to enjoy the Great Outdoors!<br/>
<br/>
Molly helped us find a letterbox site of our own!  But it will have to wait until our official 1st box is released, but the box is in place.  Priorities, ya know.<br/>
<br/>
F59 HH2 X2 V1 and G4 and P soon.  Gotta go now!<br/>
