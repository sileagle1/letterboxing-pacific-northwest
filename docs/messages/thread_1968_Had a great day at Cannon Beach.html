Hi all, we have been vacationing at Cannon Beach and I had a chance to<br/>
take the family on a hike today to see the view from Ecola State Park<br/>
and get the Cannon Beach Letterbox that Amanda from Seattle planted. <br/>
Thanks Amanda for the great hike and really cool stamp.  We saw over a<br/>
dozen caribo grazing in the field on out way up and on our way back. <br/>
How cool is that.<br/>

Shows how much I know about large animals.  Dogs, cats and fish I<br/>
know.  Someone at the park said caribo.  I just know that they weren't<br/>
deer.  Thanks for the clarification.  I was also going to check on<br/>
your box there but the children were tired and wanted to head back to<br/>
the hotel to go swimming.  I read that it may be missing anyway so<br/>
didn't push it.<br/>

If you saw them at the park then they were definitely Elk. Thanks for thinking of <br/>
my letterbox there. I'm almost sure that it is gone. Too bad, it was a really cool <br/>
stamp. Maybe someday I'll be over that way again and replace it.<br/>
