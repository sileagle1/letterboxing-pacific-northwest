After a long period of no letterboxing, I'm back into the swing and I <br>
have some box updates.  I recently started an afterschool <br>
letterboxing club at the school where I work and I've introduced 6 <br>
young letterboxers to the hobby.  <br>
<br>
Here are the boxes we've looked for lately:<br>
<br>
*Barry's Bush Park box is still alive<br>
*Windairen's Willamette University box is still alive<br>
*We looked for Windairen and Whizbang's 1st Willamette box for about <br>
45 minutes without luck :(--any clues?<br>
*Funhog's 45th Parallel box is still alive and it needs a new book--<br>
if you aren't able to get there easily, I can replace it for you!<br>
<br>
These are the ones we've found so far, but Salem needs more boxes!<br>
<br>
We also planted one in commemoration of the first Howard Street <br>
Charter School letterboxing club at Bush Park.  Go find it!<br>

alrighty, I belive the Brat Pack can accomadate you there! (I've got 5 boxes<br>

weeks.  <br>

My letterboxing pack always has a sheet of plastic in<br>
it for those not-so-dry sitting places. You will also <br>
always find a large, dry cleaner-sized plastic bag in <br>
my kit. You can put the log books, your ink and your <br>
arms all the way inside for dry stamping. A few drops<br>
of rain on a logbook which is then resealed in a baggie<br>
can lead to fuzzy, smelly mold in short order, something<br>
I do my best to avoid. Funhog<br>
