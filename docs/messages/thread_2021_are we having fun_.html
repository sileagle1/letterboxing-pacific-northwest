sad to say we went to check the status of our Whale of a Time box in<br>
Comox BC and it is missing!!waa waa.<br>
Then we went down the road to attempt to find the Poem Box and alas,<br>
it is missing too. We searched every single hole. I have contacted the<br>
placer of that one. We have had so little success in finding<br>
letterboxes. Lat week we tried to find about 11 different boxes in 3<br>
different series and they were missing!! The kids still have smiles,<br>
though not as big and not nearly as enthusiastic as when we first<br>
started 'hunting'.  Planting is seemingly, at this point, so much more<br>
rewarding.<br>
But all is not lost. A fellow boxer who lives about an hour away has<br>
offered to take us out in search of their boxes!<br>
yippee!!<br>
