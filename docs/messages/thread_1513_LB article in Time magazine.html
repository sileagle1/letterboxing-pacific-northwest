It mentioned Funhog, SpringChick, MapSurfer, and the been-everywhere, <br/>
found-every-box Ryan.  We have celebrities in our midst - so cool!<br/>

HA!  That would be Wanda!  I've got a LONG way to reach the "found-<br/>
every-box" level, though I'm doing pretty well on the "been-<br/>
everywhere" side of things.  =)<br/>
<br/>
This last week I hid a letterbox in my 27th state!  Wooo-who!<br/>

You know, I was pretty okay with the whole Time article coming out, <br/>
but I'm absolutely astounded at the chain of media enquiries it's <br/>
caused.  Now I'm beginning to wish I could put the genie back in that <br/>
bottle, but I guess we'll just have to adapt like we always have.<br/>

nothing like you. By the way did you see the article from the Atlanta <br/>
Journal Constitution Saturday before the Gathering, it listed your <br/>
site.  I posted our experience Sat. on SE group but I will post <br/>
here.  We passed 3 newbies on the trails Sat.  We were going to do an <br/>
exchange but when asked (she was waving the clues around) &amp; sort of <br/>
dumbfoundedly replied "uh we don't have stamps or books but thought <br/>
it might be fun to come out &amp; kill a Sat. to see what this was all <br/>
about."  Real discreet.  This is the result of the recent publicity, <br/>
I fear it will only get worse.<br/>
