                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently received a message from the Fort Vancouver Public Library <br/>
concerning my Bookworm Letterbox that is hidden there. It seems that <br/>
when visitors cannot find this box, they are asking the library staff <br/>
for the location. Fortunately, the staff has welcomed this letterbox <br/>
into their library and has informed me that a geocache is also located <br/>
there. I was also informed that the library reshelves their books <br/>
periodically and that my clues for this box may not pertain to it's <br/>
hidding place much longer. The staff was gracious enough to show me <br/>
some areas that will be more suitable for this little worm so check the <br/>
clues before heading out to find him since the clues have changed.<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
