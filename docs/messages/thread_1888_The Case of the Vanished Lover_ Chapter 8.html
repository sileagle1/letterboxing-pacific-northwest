Chapter 8<br>
<br>
I drove out of the McPhetridge farm and back over the hill toward<br>
town.  It was only 12:30 so I decided to grab a bite to eat before I<br>
went back to my office. The Spar Restaurant on 4th Ave is the home of<br>
the best fish and chips in Olympia. They also serve a great milkshake.<br>
And best of all, the old guys that congregate there in the noon hour<br>
always have some great stories to share with any patron that will<br>
listen.  <br>
<br>
As I drove back toward Olympia and the Spar a thought occurred to me,<br>
maybe I should ask some of the old men at the Spar if they knew<br>
anything about McCaw and Geraldson. Most of the older gents that hang<br>
out at the Spar are old loggers that survived the woods and lived to<br>
tell all about it. The stories they tell are often embellished but<br>
more than not true. It couldn't hurt to ask.<br>
<br>
I parked along 4th Ave and walked half a block and crossed the street<br>
to the restaurant. I entered and walked up and sat at the middle seat<br>
at the bar. There were 3 older fellows at the far end of the bar<br>
holding a discussion on the merits of corked boots versus rubber soled<br>
boots in the woods. There was a middle aged couple at a booth along<br>
the wall and another man wearing a grey fedora in the booth at the far<br>
end reading a paper. I listened in on the boot debate and perused the<br>
menu on the chalkboard mounted on the wall across the bar. Special of<br>
the day was a Reuben Sandwich and fries. Soup of the day- beef and<br>
barley. I decided on a cheeseburger, no fries and a vanilla shake.<br>
<br>
While I waited for my meal I listened to the old timers and their<br>
discussion.  It had drifted away from the fine differences in sole<br>
material and on to what is the best salmon lure for fishing the river<br>
mouths of Puget Sound. The daredevil spoon was holding a lead two to<br>
one over the flasher and salmon fly. One fellow mentioned using fresh<br>
cut herring and was quickly beaten down with cries of "chummer" and<br>
"poacher" and the debate quickly continued on to the virtues of using<br>
lures over live bait for the purely sportsman aspect of it. Then one<br>
of them, an almost balded man with a red plaid shirt and suspenders<br>
hitched to a pair of grubby old dungarees began talking about the<br>
salmon runs up McClane Creek that he used to see back around the turn<br>
of the century.<br>
<br>
That was my cue. I had finished my cheeseburger and was sipping my<br>
shake. Finally I made my intro. "Say, Mr. I heard you mention fishing<br>
in McClane Creek. You around when the McCaw Company had their<br>
operation going on over at Mud Bay?"<br>
<br>
"Shore, I worked for McCaw back 'round '04. Was a choker first up at<br>
Bordeaux then worked the yarder until 1912. I moved on to Simpson up<br>
out of Shelton and then to Weyerhauser's operation over at Woodard<br>
Bay. McCaw was a pretty hazardous outfit as I remember it. Why you<br>
ask?"  At the mention of McCaw by the old timer the man reading the<br>
paper peered over the news and looked at me in the mirror on the far<br>
wall. As soon as he realized that I had seen him look he quickly<br>
returned to his paper.  <br>
<br>
"Oh, well, I had heard somewhere that the McCaw Company had a large<br>
operation out in the Black Hills and that quite a lot of men had died<br>
in an accident there back near the turn of the century. I've never<br>
before met anyone who actually worked for McCaw so I was just curious<br>
if you had heard about the accident."<br>
<br>
"McCaw a large operation? Naw! Small potata's. Now Weyerhauser's camp<br>
up at Vail was a big outfit. I used to....."<br>
<br>
"Aw come on Bill, you know that Simpson's Stump Lake Camp was bigger<br>
than the Vail operation." said one of his cronies. Now a discussion<br>
erupted over what logging camp was bigger than the rest on the basis<br>
of how many bunk cars were parked there or how large the mess halls<br>
were and so on.  Mr. Fedora pretended not to listen but I caught him<br>
looking over the paper through the mirror from time to time.  I let<br>
the discussion continue and left three dollars on the counter for my<br>
$2.15 lunch and exited the cafe quickly.  <br>
<br>
Instead of returning to my car I decided to duck into a furniture<br>
store at the next corner to throw off a certain nosy someone in case<br>
he tried to follow. I browsed the lamp shades near the front of the<br>
store while I watched the window for Mr. Fedora. Sure enough, he<br>
walked quickly along the sidewalk and stopped outside the front of the<br>
store. He appeared as if he didn't know where to go and then turned<br>
toward the store. I quickly ducked behind a wardrobe and slipped off<br>
my overcoat and hat in case he was keying on my clothing. He walked<br>
through the store and eyeballed all the customers while I acted like I<br>
was inspecting the price tag of the wardrobe. A salesperson began<br>
walking toward him and he turned and left satisfied to himself that I<br>
hadn't chosen to hide inside. <br>
<br>
I moved back to the window to see where he headed. He crossed the<br>
street and was almost hit by a truck then he got into a dark blue<br>
Plymouth and drove up the hill and out of sight.  Feeling secure<br>
enough to leave the store but not too sure if Mr. Fedora would come<br>
back, I decided to loop around the store and walked through the<br>
alleyway back to the next street and to my car.  What would have been<br>
so interesting to Mr. Fedora to make him want to follow me at the<br>
mention of McCaw?  I was afraid that I had let the cat out of the bag<br>
so to speak with my question to the old man but I was glad that I had<br>
made this Fedora fellow before he could waylay me and do who knows what.<br>
<br>
I got in my car and doublechecked to make sure that the strongbox that<br>
McPhetridge had given me was still there.  Then I drove back to my<br>
office. The long way. Always making sure to keep an eye out for blue<br>
Plymouths. No followers.  Now to deal with Phyllis. I think I'd rather<br>
deal with the man in the fedora.<br>
<br>
"Look here, Enigma. Like I told you on Friday, if you don't pay me in<br>
full by the end of this week I am leaving." I didn't figure I'd get<br>
lambasted the second I walked in the door.<br>
<br>
"So good to see you too Phyllis. Look, I'm really sorry about your<br>
back pay. I don't think paying you will be a problem. This new client<br>
has already paid me a sizable retainer and I expect that I can wring<br>
some more out of her too.  I should be able to pay the rest of the<br>
$120 I owe you by Friday."<br>
<br>
"What about my $85 for working this week? Don't forget that.  I'm not<br>
gonna let you walk all over me again, SB."<br>
<br>
"How about I give you another $40 right now and the rest on Friday?"<br>
<br>
"Allright, but you better not Welch on me Enigma Stealthboxxer or I<br>
will walk. Friday at 5pm and no later!"<br>
<br>
"Allright."<br>
<br>
"So that sappy dame I sent up to you on Friday was for real? I figured<br>
her for a jilted Suzie. What the heck are you doing for her? You goin<br>
soft these days or just desperate for a meal ticket?"<br>
<br>
"Very funny, Phyllis. You know as well as I do that my case load has<br>
been rather light lately. To tell you the truth she barged in here and<br>
laid a sob story on me about her man disappearing and then before I<br>
could get any real information out of her she dropped a wad of cash<br>
and left. I kind of took the case by default."<br>
<br>
"So this dame have anything to do with those people you have me<br>
digging up?"<br>
<br>
"I think so, yes.  Whacha get?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I've got an address for Davis McPhetridge."<br>
<br>
"I'm way ahead of you there.  I just came from the McPhetridge farm<br>
and I spoke with the man myself. What about McCaw and Geraldson? You<br>
find out anything on them?"<br>
<br>
"Geraldson Corporation had an office on Mud Bay, which just happens to<br>
be next door to the McPhetridge farm....which I see you already know.<br>
They just sold their property on September 28. The regional manager<br>
who was in charge of their office is named John Corbin and he owns a<br>
home over on Eastside Street. Here is the address. But don't bother<br>
calling on him because my friend at the county clerk's office tells me<br>
the home is being sold and the deal will close this week.  She says<br>
the Corbin has a forwarding address in Colorado."<br>
<br>
"Yes, McPhetridge mentioned that Geraldson was moving their office<br>
back to their headquarters in Colorado.  Did you find anything on McCaw?"<br>
<br>
"Well that took some doing. All I could find was a record of the McCaw<br>
Corporation, which incidentally was headquarted at the same address as<br>
the Geraldson Corporation....so, you know that too. Anyway the McCaw<br>
Company closed in 1927."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I know all that. Did you find out anything on the former<br>
president of the company, Sam McCaw?"<br>
<br>
"Well, the clerk's office did find a record of his posthumous death<br>
certificate. Seems he died in 1917 while away on business in Alaska<br>
and the body was never found."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I am aware of that also. Did McCaw have any family?"<br>
<br>
"He left behind a wife and a son, also named Sam.  Records show they<br>
rented out their home in West Olympia and moved out of town in 1918."<br>
<br>
"Any record on where they went?"<br>
<br>
"The assessor's office showed a mailing address for their taxes as in<br>
the town of Steilacoom. Here is the address."<br>
<br>
"You able to confirm that the McCaw's are still in Steilacoom?"<br>
<br>
"Way ahead of you, SB. Sam McCaw Jr. is the deeded owner of the house<br>
in Steilacoom. His mother died in 1930."<br>
<br>
"Phyllis, you do some great work."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well I had to call in a lot of favors to get it SB. I think it<br>
should be at least worth another one of those gold coins you been<br>
laying around here.  What's this all about anyway? I can't see how any<br>
of this can be connected to that crazy lady I sent up to you the other<br>
day."<br>
<br>
"I'm not sure what it's all about either but the deeper I dig the<br>
smellier it gets.  Tell you what, you did a great job in gathering the<br>
info.  Here's a ten spot for your trouble. Consider this a bonus. <br>
Like I promised, you'll get the rest of your pay on Friday."<br>
<br>
"I'd better. Remember what I said. I'll walk."<br>
<br>
"I know.  Tell you what. It's already after 2 and it's not likely that<br>
I will get any calls other than bill collectors today. Why don't you<br>
take the rest of the afternoon off?"<br>
<br>
"With pay, right?"<br>
<br>
"Of course." <br>
<br>
"Thanks, SB. Maybe you're not so bad after all. Here's a  message from<br>
the phone company and three from the electric company, you had better<br>
pay them off soon or they will cut off the power--just not before you<br>
pay me, and the mail is on your desk."  She grabbed her coat and hat<br>
and purse and headed for the door smiling. Then, she turned to me just<br>
before leaving, "Just remember, I mean it about walking."<br>
<br>
The door slammed and I stood there just like last Friday. Yes,<br>
Phyllis, I believe you.<br>
