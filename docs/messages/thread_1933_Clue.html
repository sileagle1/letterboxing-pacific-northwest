thrill of putting together the mystery and the "AH HAH" moment when all the<br>
pieces fell into places? How would you like to be a part of a letterboxing<br>
Clue game?<br>
<br>
March 12th you'll get your chance. The Brat Pack is hosting a welcome home<br>
party for Steve of Team Rayvenhaus. (He's coming home just for a bit to take<br>
care of some matters). But what's a party without party games? Thanks to our<br>
friends on the other half of this fine country we have the opportunity to<br>
use their letterboxing Clue game. This is your chance to be part of the fun<br>
and collect 22 new stamps.<br>
<br>
If you would like more information or to RSVP email me off list!<br>
