                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know of a very famous mystery guest or two (no relation or blood <br/>
ties to me) who will be in the Puget Sound region the evening of 29 <br/>
May and again on the evening of 4 June.  I was thinking about <br/>
orchestrating a Mystery Guest Gathering sometime around then to <br/>
welcome this guest in full Puget Sound fashion!!!  It could start <br/>
out as an afternoon event somewhere in and around the SeaTac area <br/>
and then 'crescendo' with the mystery guest appearing during/just <br/>
prior to dinner time for exchanges and fellowship.  Anybody in on <br/>
this?  We'd have to find a nice venue somewhere near SeaTac, <br/>
preferrably a quick jaunt off I-5 with nice picnic facilities.  Let <br/>
me know if you have any ideas.  I know of a nice facility in Des <br/>
Moines on the water but have no idea how popular it is on a Friday <br/>
afternoon/evening in May (the park near the Des Moines Marina).  <br/>
Another option could be Salt Water SP or Dash Point SP?  Of course, <br/>
those both come with hefty parking fees.  Another option could be <br/>
Brown's Point Lighthouse--a bit further than optimal but you sure <br/>
can't beat the view &amp; the price--especially in May!!!  Not sure <br/>
about existing picnic table facilities at the park, though.<br/>
<br/>
For me personally, 29 May is a much better time because I have to <br/>
work VERY, VERY early on 5 June WAY FAR AWAY from here but if nobody <br/>
else can attend on 29 May, I'd suffer to host it on 4 June.  ;)<br/>
Any/all ideas welcome (provided they're rated G). <br/>
<br/>

PS As for the identity of the mystery guest(s), let's just say you'd <br/>
be VERY, VERY excited to sport his/her/their signature stamp(s) in <br/>
your letterboxing journals...  ;)<br/>

arrive via wings of the wright bros and is heading North the <br/>
following day.  I'd have to study the region some more to find some <br/>
really great venues for a Saturday evening.  I'm leaning toward  <br/>
something North of Tacoma more for the comfort of our visitors.  Des <br/>
Moines Beach Park is about 5 miles from the airport and it offers a <br/>
couple of possible venues.  The park by the water obviously has the <br/>
best view (adjacent the marina), a playground nearby and is about 4 <br/>
miles West of the Kent/Des Moines exit off of I-5.  It's been ages <br/>
since I spent time at the park but I'm pretty sure it has some <br/>
picnic tables and parking is free--which is always a plus.<br/>
<br/>
Whaddya think?<br/>

Bad timing for Nailhead.  Graduation Season, lots of parties to <br/>
outfit.  But who knows, if it is closer to May 29 than June 5 then <br/>
we may be able to make a quick show.  <br/>
<br/>
With an exchange opportunity like this one (if I am correct in my <br/>

can to make it.<br/>

The only downside of the 29th is that it is Memorial Day weekend. I <br/>
know that MiniBullyMom is going to be in Eastern WA that weekend. So <br/>
that means that her vote (when I called her) would be for Friday the <br/>
4th of June! <br/>
<br/>
As to the venue...what ever works for us! Isn't there a letterbox at <br/>
Browns Point Lighthouse? The State Parks do offer an annual parking <br/>
pass if memory serves me correctly. The $5-- day use/parking fee <br/>
they charge can be offset by carpooling to a certain extent.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm leaning toward May 29 partly because we could actually spend <br/>
more time 'gathering' on a Saturday afternoon for food, fun &amp; <br/>
fellowship with it eventually spilling into an evening versus <br/>
getting a late start on a 'workday' Friday afternoon and fighting <br/>
Puget Sound traffic to &amp; fro on the 4th.  For folks who are unable <br/>
to link up to meet the mystery guest(s) on the 29th, they may be <br/>
able to schedule an additional mini-event for June 4th for those who <br/>
aren't able to make it to the event on the 29th--depending on the <br/>
guest's' plans while in the area?  I understand it's a holiday <br/>
weekend but our mystery guest(s) is/are limited in his/her/their <br/>
availability during this visit to our neck of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
I studied Des Moines' parks &amp; rec site and there are quite a few <br/>
parks in the area.  I'm only personally familiar with a few parks on <br/>
the list with the Beach Park jumping out at me (view, functioning <br/>
toilets &amp; water fountains, playground, picnic tables, a couple <br/>
trails AND NARY A RESIDENT LETTERBOX).  I'm really honing in on that <br/>
region because of our mystery guest's schedule, the location from <br/>
which he/she/they hail, and where he/she/they must be at 0dark30 the <br/>
following day (opposite side of the region).  <br/>
<br/>
Directions to Des Moines Beach Park from I-5 follow:<br/>
<br/>
At exit 149B, turn RIGHT onto Ramp (WA-516 / Des Moines) 0.3m  <br/>
Turn RIGHT (West) onto SR-516 [S Kent des Moines Rd] 2.1m  <br/>
Bear RIGHT (North-West) onto SR-509 [Marine View Dr S] 0.3m<br/>
Turn LEFT (West) onto S 223rd St 0.2m<br/>
Road name changes to Cliff Ave S 0.1m<br/>
Road name changes to Nebo Blvd 0.1m<br/>
Road name changes to Local road(s) &lt; 0.1m<br/>
End: Arrive Des Moines Beach Park<br/>
<br/>
So, it isn't as far from I-5 as I thought (3.2 miles).  It does, <br/>
however, feel like it's worlds away from the hustle &amp; bustle of <br/>
traffic &amp; daily life.<br/>
<br/>
This park isn't the largest in the state but if folks are interested <br/>
in boosting the region's letterbox population, there are several <br/>
other neighboring parks scattered about the region that might <br/>
welcome a box or two.  Plant the boxes within the next several weeks <br/>
and then post the clues a night or two before the gathering--then <br/>
folks could hunt for those boxes before the formal part of the meet <br/>
&amp; greet.  There is also a great 6-box letterbox series not terribly <br/>
far from this venue planted by Amanda from Seattle (Flight Path <br/>
Series)--so folks looking for some hunts &amp; great stamps won't be <br/>
disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
Any more ideas?  Our other option is to gather at a restaurant <br/>
somewhere near the airport but that sort of event gets pretty <br/>
tedious requiring RSVPs/reservations, commitments from participants <br/>
and a case of heebies/jeebies for those of us with squirmy little <br/>
kids who subject them to interacting with the public in 'formal' <br/>
settings (i.e. involving utensils, food and physics experiments in <br/>
mass, force &amp; projectiles).  With the sun setting later in the <br/>
evening nowadays, we could start the formalities of the event around <br/>
2 or 3pm and then culminate everything with the appearance of the <br/>
guest(s) for exchanges?  I'm not terribly certain, yet, about the <br/>
arrival time of our guest(s) but planning it this way would allow <br/>
those folks who can't stay very long to meet some area letterboxers <br/>
while the others who can stay for the duration will be able to meet <br/>
the mystery guest(s).  Depending on the guest's' arrival time, we <br/>
could slide the start time forwards or backwards a bit so the most <br/>
folks in the region could participate...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep the ideas flowing.  We'll get something sorted out,<br/>

involved with providing entertainment to parties, especially <br/>
Graduation Parties, and June 4 is the single busiest day (entire 24 <br/>
hours of parties) in our business with a good 1/3 of high schools <br/>
having graduation ceremonies on that evening. I will probably have <br/>
been working for 36 hours straight by the time the evening of the <br/>
4th rolls around. However, we typically do not have many parties <br/>
over the Memorial Weekend, kind of a calm before the storm if you <br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
If the event happened on June 4 I would definately not be able to <br/>
attend.  I agree too that a Saturday afternoon would be a much <br/>
better choice allowing the gathering to extend into the evening <br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
How about a Poll to decide?  It worked for the Stamp Camp last year, <br/>
what does everyone think?<br/>
