with the kids. We both love Oriental food and were anxious to find <br/>
this box. Followed the clues to the Parent Tree, but there was no <br/>
obvious greenery to look under. We were carefully looking around <br/>
when I stumbled upon a ground wasp nest. As I backed away from that <br/>
area Wild Woman exclaimed, "Wait a minute! That is Poison Oak!!!"<br/>
We quickly took note of our suroundings and relized we were <br/>
surrounded by the devils. Luckily 3 of the children were running <br/>
around on the paved path and did not follow us into the trees. My <br/>
son Josh froze and carefully followd instructions to get out of the <br/>
plants safely with us. Luckily we did not just start foraging <br/>
through the underbrush is search of the box. We believe the box to <br/>
be missing. Could the owner of the box verify very carefully if it <br/>
is gone and then delete the clues so no other innocent fools like me <br/>
fall into the poison oak trap. <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

P.S. I would love to find this stamp in a safer lacation. I am very <br/>
curious to see it:)<br/>
