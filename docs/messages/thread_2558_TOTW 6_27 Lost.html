What have you lost while letterboxing? <br/>
Did you actually return to try to find it?  <br/>
<br/>
Let's see...   <br/>
<br/>
I've lost my sanity (occasionally on those supposedly 'quick' LBs that <br/>
turn into entire afternoons of hunting--while we're driving cross <br/>
country), my way (often), lots of good years left on my car and some <br/>
weight (woo hoo)!<br/>
<br/>
Did I return to find them?  Hopefully my sanity returned by itself <br/>
(although that's difficult to self-diagnose), somehow I've made it back <br/>
to my house intact after all those wayward hunts, the car is a lost <br/>
cause and the weight...wouldn't want any of that back.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it we haven't lost anything 'tangible' during our <br/>
outings (except maybe a clue sheet that got rained on here or there)--<br/>
that might be because just about anything that's of value is dummy-<br/>
corded to the pack.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Fun topic!<br/>
