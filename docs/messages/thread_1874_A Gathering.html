Hi,<br/>
Just wondering, How do you get a gathering started? How do you <br/>
organize one? I'd like to do one on east side of washington. Just <br/>
cause I can't come to the one in silver falls. Any answers would be <br/>
appreciated.<br/>

The best way to start a gathering is to simply put out a 'feeler' <br/>
note and see if anybody else in the region is interested. Then it <br/>
sort of develops after that as you try to come up with a date that <br/>
works for the most folks.  <br/>
<br/>
We've been to an assortment of gatherings around the country and <br/>
even one in BC that ranged from multi-day camping events, to one <br/>
LONG day of non-stop letterboxing, several 'couple hour' meets at <br/>
local parks to welcome non-local letterboxers visiting the region, <br/>
to a gathering in a mall food court concluding with a mystery dinner <br/>
at an interesting restaurant elsewhere in that same city to a simple <br/>
meet at this restaurant at this time--we'll have a table for 15-20 <br/>
reserved, etc.  We've even attended a gathering at somebody's own <br/>
home--sort of an appetizer/potluck type affair that ended with <br/>
looking for a couple local boxes as a group before the sun set.  <br/>
<br/>
You're really only limited to your imagination.  I've hosted a <br/>
handful of these events and along the way have attempted to each <br/>
time vary the park/meeting location, the day/time the group meets <br/>
(to work with folks' varying work schedules--weekdays vs weekends, <br/>
church schedules, kids/no kids, etc) and the theme for the event <br/>
itself.  Focus on something rather unique for an event (for fear of <br/>
violating corporate copyrights/trademarks)--my themes are usually <br/>
quite bizarre which hopefully evoke interesting creative responses.  <br/>
Somewhere along the way pick somebody to carve an event stamp for <br/>
the gathering.  One gathering we went to, they made the event stamp <br/>
a 'free for all' instead of assigning one individual and the six <br/>
resulting stamps were incredible (all different ideas on a similar <br/>
theme--it was really cool)!  I really treasure those stamps--they're <br/>
along the same lines as Monet's paintings--same location, differing <br/>
light conditions/times of year.  Just cool!<br/>
<br/>
Anyways the modified movie adage 'if you plant them, they will come' <br/>
usually works to encourage more letterbox planting in your area.  <br/>
The same thing seems to ring true for coordinating letterboxing <br/>
events.<br/>
