And this six year old gets major extra credit for this find! I ran out there today to have <br>
a look since some of the info in private email had me scratching my head in wonder. <br>
It seems that the box that you found was the original box that was presumed MIA <br>
long ago. It was not in the original hiding place, just nearby. The replacement has <br>
been in place for years.<br>

You can claim the honor of being the only letterboxer to have stamped into that <br>
original logbook. The only other signature is that of the gardener. <br>

No excuses allowed! The box that is in the 'right' place is still there waiting for <br>
everyone, including those clever Forest People. The clues are still completely <br>
accurate. Plus, now the box has two logbooks and two stamps in it, original and <br>
replacement... There is more magic on that island than I knew. Funhog<br>
