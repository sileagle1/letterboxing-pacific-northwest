It seems that the box that you found was the original box that was presumed MIA <br/>
long ago. It was not in the original hiding place, just nearby. The replacement has <br/>
been in place for years.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Other than a garden maintenance worker, that came across it <br/>
&gt; accidentially, it appears we were the first to find this legendary <br/>
&gt; Funhog box after more than three years.<br/>
You can claim the honor of being the only letterboxer to have stamped into that <br/>
original logbook. The only other signature is that of the gardener. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; In defense of everyone else who looked for it, the box had been obscured <br/>
&gt; in such a way that the clues weren't completely accurate.  We placed it <br/>
&gt; back in its lair so that the 'ring' can be found.<br/>
No excuses allowed! The box that is in the 'right' place is still there waiting for <br/>
everyone, including those clever Forest People. The clues are still completely <br/>
accurate. Plus, now the box has two logbooks and two stamps in it, original and <br/>
replacement... There is more magic on that island than I knew. Funhog<br/>
