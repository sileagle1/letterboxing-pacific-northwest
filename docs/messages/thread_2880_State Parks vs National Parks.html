                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, up until this last year, letterboxes were absolutely verboten in<br/>
all National Parks. However, a new regulation allows individual park<br/>
managers to decide on a case by case basis. This is pretty much the<br/>
same policy in Oregon State Parks. Some managers welcome boxes (Silver<br/>
Falls) and others frown on them (Tryon Creek.) <br/>
<br/>
The same ranger manages both Tryon Creek and McIver and allows boxes<br/>
in the latter but not the former. Go figure. She told me that Tryon<br/>
gets too much traffic already and that boxes might end up causing user<br/>
trails.<br/>
<br/>
Still somewhat confusing but at least they are kinda maybe allowed<br/>
sometimes and in some places. Funhog<br/>
