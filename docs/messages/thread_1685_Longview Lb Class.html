Hi all! I just got word that my letterboxing class offered by <br>
Kelso Longview Parks and Recreation is about to be canceled <br>
due to small enrollment. Anyone who is interested in this <br>
class, which begins this Tuesday, please call Karry Williquette <br>
at 369-442-5400 Monday. The class includes two evening <br>
classroom sessions 10/12, 10/19 (6-9 PM) and a letterbox <br>
hunt 10/23 (1-4 PM.) I hope there are two or three of you out<br>
there who are interested and available at such short notice. <br>

This sounds like a LOT of fun!!!!<br>
We are booked solid every weekend this entire month. <br>
Call it "stretching one's self too thin" or<br>
unintentional insanity.....regardless we are<br>
overwhelmed with committments.  Kelso isn't too far<br>
away either....SHUCKS!<br>

If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br>
