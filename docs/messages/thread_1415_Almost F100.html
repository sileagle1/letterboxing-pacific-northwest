                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I was counting my F stamps in my personal log book this <br>
morning and thought what a great idea to try to get F100 in my first <br>
month...but then I looked at the date of my first <br>
stamp...funhogs "Go Fish"...it was the 29th...that was today...well <br>
technically yesterday since it's now 12:42 am on Wed.., but I <br>
haven't gone to bed yet so for me it's still Tues. night. This <br>
morning (tues)I had 80 stamps. I hit pupps new ones in Ridgefield, <br>
WA...my first firsties...at 6:30 am, before work..that's when the <br>
gates open in the wildlife refuge, I actually had to wait about 10 <br>
min for the gate to automatically open thinking if it didn't open by <br>
then I was going to have to leave or i'd be late for work. After <br>
work I picked up 2 more of pupps and then my friend "Sunshine" and I <br>
took off for Pandora and Iron Bear's Childhood series up by the zoo.<br>
We found the last box at 10:55 pm, but alas I was only able to get <br>
to F97...I had to go home, it was past my bed time. I'm hoping to <br>
pick up 3 tomorrow...today...Wednesday. Maybe that can count for <br>
F100 in a month...I did have 4 HH and a PLB, but I don't think those <br>
actually count as true finds...or do they? If they do then I did get <br>
to 100!! This is just crazy...but the hunt is so much fun. <br>
I guess I should work on placing some more boxes now...since I have <br>
filled up my personal log now. I have also had an almost exchange. I <br>
ran into Wild Woman on the hunt, but she wasn't really planning on <br>
boxing that day, so she didn't have her stamp to exchange, but I've <br>
left room for her to stamp the next time I see her.<br>
<br>
I want to thank those of you who have posted such positive feedback <br>
on my Fantasy Forest series...placing was a bit harder than I <br>
thought it was going to be and I was a bit nervous.<br>
I really must go to bed now...it's past my bedtime...<br>
