but I just can't. (never could). I noticed that the main list now <br/>
has a database for findings and missings. Is that something that <br/>
would work in this group or would that be 1)redundant or 2)as not up <br/>
to date as postings may be (in general). That is to say that "I <br/>
found it"s could be there along with "Missings"? <br/>

Thanks,<br/>

Rose (who has only found 1 in Lincoln City, and 4 of the 6 in West <br/>
Linn and who failed to find 1 in Lincoln City, 1 in Oregon City, and <br/>
2 in Salem)<br/>
