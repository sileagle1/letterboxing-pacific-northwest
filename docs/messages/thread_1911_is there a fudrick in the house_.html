Hello- we set out last Saturday to find the Irene<br>
Rinehardt park box in Ellensburg.  I know it's cold<br>
9and snowflakes were actually falling) but we didn't<br>
care, we have cabin fever and just HAD to get out!  if<br>
it wasn't so cold we would have done the Canyon Road<br>
boxes, too but we ran out of steam.<br>
<br>
Anyhow- we didn't find it.  I think the "Why's" on the<br>
path must look totally different in the winter.  We<br>
couldn't tell what was new growth and what was old<br>
growth.  We THINK we found the "bumping head spot" on<br>
our way back to the car (indicating we turned wrong at<br>
a "why") but we were stumped to find two "triangles at<br>
the 5-10 pace mark.  One was lying on the ground, the<br>
other was standing up.  Both were covered in thorny<br>
brush but we barreled through, dug through the thick<br>
layers of fallen leaves and gave up after about 20<br>
minutes (and we really had to go potty)<br>
We'll try it again later in the year when things are<br>
actually growing and alive and snow isn't coming down!<br>

We found it not terribly long after it was first hidden--Aug 03.  I <br>
remember finding it in a spot that was on the opposite side of the <br>
trail than the clues suggested.  Of course, at the point we saw <br>
anything that remotely resembled what the clues said we were so <br>
turned around that it was really tenacity that found it for us.  We <br>
saw some sort of landmark mentioned in the clues (going off of a <br>
2+year old memory here--is it a metal pole or concrete post? did it <br>
mention something about 'orange'?) and tried it from there.  It was <br>
on the opposite side of the trail as we expected it to be is all I <br>
really remember.  Maybe this will help?<br>

I brought a non-letterboxing friend with me and after hiking for about 3 miles in the mud (kinda hard on her new Toyota Tundra interior) we finally gave up.  For us the clues stopped making sense just after crossing the first bridge.  We never did find the head bumping tree, but figured it was where the trees were sawed through to make the path passable.  We also had trouble with another fudrick box--the Very Presidential Mystery Letterbox.  I'm sure we found the correct location, but many sand trucks had been there scooping sand.  I think it may be covered over.  Darn!  This was just about  enough  for my non letterboxing friend.  I had to drag her into Schmitz Park (West Seattle) where we found Schmitz Squirrel and Schmitz Creek.  I don't think she's recovered yet!  Colls<br>

Hi :o) Sorry you didnt have any luck finding the LB. As of yet I have <br>
not attempted to locate that one. Your pictures were fun to look at. <br>
I am always curious to see what the "elusive" letterboxer looks like, <br>
since they are so rarely seen. I have only every spotted 3 of these <br>
things since starting letterboxing a year and a half ago.... hmm.. <br>
interesting... this one wears pink...  hehe  :o) <br>
