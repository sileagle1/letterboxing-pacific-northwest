   <br>
  (Sorry if this gets sent twice...connection problems...)<br>
   <br>
  Taking over for the week...<br>
   <br>
  We've discussed how far you will go for a box in terms of how many miles.  Now let's discuss how far you WON'T go for a box.<br>
   <br>
  We all know (I think) to "leave no trace," but there are some gray areas...and some tempting boxes.  National parks, private property...one step off the path won't leave a trace...  If we never planted any boxes on property where people might in any way be displeased to find them, there would be a heck of a lot fewer boxes, which means some people are "breaking the rules."  (But nobody mention any names, here!  That's not my intention!)  I know we don't want to admit when we've broken rules, but I'm sure we have all "slipped" every now and again and even thought of planting someplace verboten or simply stepped on something we shouldn't have.<br>
   <br>
  Additionally, some boxes can require a lot of you.  Certain skills (i.e. rock climbing) or simply a long hike can put it out of your range.  Sometimes the way these things are mentioned in the clues, sometimes not.  And sometimes you get to know that somebody else's "moderate difficulty" is not exactly your idea of "moderate."  Or maybe you're really looking for those long ones (mentioning names here:  RYAN...haha...) and the short hikes just don't do it for you.<br>
   <br>
  So what do people put in clues that deters you?  Hike is too tough?  Hike is too easy?  Not an interesting park?  Location seems a little (or a lot) over the line?  When have you thought, "You know, this is just not worth it..." and gave up the possibility for a stamp?<br>
   <br>
  Inquiring minds and all that...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I already shared my Paris boxing experience--not giving up on one after<br>
several other failed exploits, which left me climbing a fence and<br>
trespassing onto an abandoned railway line then being threatened by some<br>
local men.  That was my "shouldn't have done it and never will again"<br>
experience (although it makes a fun story now that I'm okay).  That same<br>
week the same planter tried to get me to climb a city building wall<br>
Spiderman-style and to climb up on a stone wall that surrounded private<br>
property only to shimmy up a bit of lightpost.  I had the sense to say no to<br>
both of those.  It drove me crazy to stare at the spots the boxes were<br>
hidden only to walk away, but I didn't feel like risking my neck.  I've<br>
decided not to look for any of that particular boxer's boxes again.<br>
<br>
I think for the most part though most letterboxers in my area have been<br>
pretty responsible.  When I find myself debating if I should get in a risky<br>
spot or go out on a precipice or something of that sort, I start retracing<br>
my steps to see if I've misread the clue.  I find myself more and more<br>
getting a sense of "I don't think they would have meant for us to do that"<br>
when I'm in the wrong spot.  Luckily very few boxes have been more than a<br>
few steps off-trail either, so I haven't had to debate much over if I'm<br>
hurting habitat.<br>
<br>
My real temptation as far as planting goes though has been national parks.<br>
I've managed to not plant there even though I live a stone's throw from some<br>
of the most amazing national parks.  Finding boxes others have left there on<br>
the other hand . . . You don't have to twist my arm too hard.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The long hikes are pretty much out of the question for me right now.  My kids <br>
range in age from four to nine, and I don't like to go boxing (or hiking) alone.  I <br>
need to share the thrill with someone.  And I'm not in condition to do the <br>
marathon ones, although I'm working on it.<br>
<br>
I also generally have avoided the more adult themed boxes, because I always <br>
have at least one kid with me.  So the beer and wine stamps, for example, are <br>
ones I don't have (although I'd really like to go get the Edgefield boxes).<br>
<br>
And I have to admit, I often won't go out of my way to search for boxes that <br>
others haven't been able to find recently (marked "attempted" on the LBNA <br>
site).  I'm spoiled to have scores of great boxes within easy driving range, so <br>
that I tend to stick with ones there's a decent chance of finding (fair-weather <br>
boxer!  ;-).  We did, however, find "See Spot" a couple of months ago, and <br>
when I went to log it at the site, realized that several people had been <br>
unsuccessful.  There's a lesson in there somewhere!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You're absolutely right, Funhog.  The same has happens with our boxes.<br>
Also, I can relate with Logos.  I wish there was a way to know which ones<br>
are really missing.  This last week I've spent hours going through the list<br>
of Portland boxes which prompted me to start marking the attempted boxes<br>
"ignore".   Now, I'm not complaining about too many boxes  - keep 'em<br>
coming!!<br>
<br>
Figuring out the box locations must be easier for those familiar with<br>
Portland.  We try to figure out all the boxes in a particular area before<br>
the hunt.  It's easy for Gresham, Estacada, etc as they are short lists<br>
compared to Portland.  Well, you know, for Portland you have to go through<br>
the whole list!  Guess that's why we've barely hit the Portland boxes.  By<br>
the time we get around to Portland again the list is old.  It would be<br>
pretty nifty if the listings included the sector - such as "Portland - SE".<br>
A few boxes do include their location and I find that very helpful.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any advice to help this country bumpkin navigate the city please<br>
write me!<br>
