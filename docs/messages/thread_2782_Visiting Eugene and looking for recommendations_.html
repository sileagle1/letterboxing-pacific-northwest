<br/>
  My parents and I will be venturing down to Eugene to pick up a new puppy (!!!) and visit my sister, and I (OF COURSE) have to try and cram in as much letterboxing as I can while down there.  I plan to abscond with the auto while mother and sister are having late Mother's Day manicures downtown, but that will likely only be an hour.  Other than that, we're staying in the Junction City area.  The trip south will be rushed, but likely the rest of the weekend less hectic.<br/>
<br/>
  So, what boxes are can't-miss and what boxes are quick to get, but still have something interesting for the letterboxing-challenged?  (Dad's been down on 'boxing since we had a particularly non-fruitful day at Pt. Defiance...)  Blue diamonds are blue diamonds and all, but you can't beat a more personable, albeit intarweb, chat.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for any and all help!<br/>

Amanda has a cute one at/near Valley River Center but you need to<br/>
watch the video first and answer a few questions to be prepared. <br/>
There is a easy but nice library box by Camp Violet.  There is also at<br/>
least one box (possibly 2 up on Skinner's Butte).<br/>

  I'm not sure what time or how much of it I'll have available.  I'll be almost entirely at the whim of four other VERY dominant (read: demanding) people who will all want to cram in a lot of other things during our time there.  It's entirely possible I will get no time to letterbox at all.  I'd hate to say I could meet you and have everybody else decide I can't.  When I say "abscond with the auto," I mean abscond....haha....<br/>

  Thanks for the recommendations.  I'm putting together my trip plans today...as well as packing and baking cookies and birthday gift shopping...all while trying to get my 8 hours of work done...oy...<br/>
