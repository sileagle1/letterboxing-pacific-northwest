Forgot the passport issue. When I turned 21 it was "the thing" to go <br/>
to the states. We had been legal for 2 years in Canada, but we still <br/>
had to do the "21" thing. That was 24 years ago... and things have <br/>
changed so much since then. In my early twenties, we sort of waved to <br/>
the U.S. border guards as we drove through. Then we waved to the <br/>
Canadian border guards as we drove home. <br/>
<br/>
Zara and I drive down to Bellingham to a craft store where we buy <br/>
carving material that we can't get in Canada. (And I have spent a <br/>
small fortune making phone calls trying to find it up here). And now I <br/>
hear, that as of 2006, we will need passports to enter the U.S. I find <br/>
it all very sad. Our countries have always boasted the longest <br/>
unguarded borders in the world. And, I suppose it is still unguarded, <br/>
but it is becoming less so.   <br/>
