I just found a cute one at a rest area near Artois in CA. Hog Heaven<br/>
Theme Park, outside of Red Bluff, is up to twenty three great boxes at<br/>
this point. The Green Tortuga has his notoriously evil Applegate rest<br/>
stop stamp in Southern Oregon and my Horse Creek Bridge box is a short<br/>
side trip off the freeway. If you have an afternoon to spend, the<br/>
Musicians Series in Portland is a must-see.<br/>
<br/>
Now, going east... The famed Jay's Toolbox is along your route just<br/>
east of Portland. Just be sure to budget enough time for the stamping<br/>
extravaganza. Wildhair has a couple of lovely little boxes in a<br/>
beautiful park at the mouth of the Deschutes River about a hundred<br/>
miles east of Portland. Anything made by Wood Aug and Kurious Jo are<br/>
bound to be wonderful stamps. They've hidden quite a few between the<br/>
Tri-Cities and Spokane.<br/>
<br/>
In Spokane there are a ton of boxes. I'm sure some of the folks there<br/>
could direct you to the gems. I've enjoyed the boxes I've found of<br/>
yours hidden around San Jose. My fingers are crossed that you'll leave<br/>
some of your work behind in the PNW for us to find here! Funhog<br/>

Given the time of year, I'm guessing you are going to take I-84 to cross <br/>
the cascades.  "Who Loves Lasagne" - which has a Blue Diamond on AQ - is <br/>
on your way out of Portland as well (Fairview, OR, just off I-84) and <br/>
quite close to Jay's Toolbox.  I think most of the boxes listed as <br/>
Troutdale are close to I-84 as well.<br/>
<br/>
If you are taking I-205 through Portland (your most direct route, but you <br/>
said you were stopping here, so you may go another way), my "Christmas Is <br/>
for The Birds" series is an easy on/off I-205 northbound and a quick find.<br/>
<br/>
"Portland Skyline at the Rose Garden" is out of your way, but takes you to <br/>
one of the spots my family always takes out of town guests for the view of <br/>
the city.  There are several other letterboxes in this area as well.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't looked for it yet, but "Free Coffee" is at the first Southbound <br/>
rest stop after you leave Portland (and after I-205 joins I-5.)<br/>
<br/>
I'd love a post-trip update, I have to make a subset of your trip early <br/>
next year and hope to do some letterboxing myself.<br/>

  Stormcrow here in Spokane. I think I have seen your wonderful personal stamp here in the area. I would love to try and arrange a small meet &amp; greet here with local boxers. What part of town will you be staying in?  The 27th is probably better for me and mine. Jealous Moon &amp; PWWG will be visiting from Alaska at my house too (we ARE the in-laws!  haha) <br/>
<br/>
  My favorite boxes on the west side of town (besides my own and Jealous moon's) are  Chief Garry, Billy Goats Gruff, Spokane Natives and Thousand Steps.  If you want a brain-strain-type vacation try both of the Fat Lady's cryptic puzzlers; Watch Where You Step and Drumheller Springs. They are wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
  If you have been here before then you have probably gotten Funhog's two great boxes and you have also likely nabbed Fishtrap lake by Judy (which was my first find as a newbie 14 months ago). There are some great new boxes in the Spokane Valley and in Northern Idaho as well. Hey! Mr. Wilson! is one of the longest hikes in the area (more to come from me in the spring) by Sondog and is a very well deserved Blue Diamond.<br/>
<br/>
  I will contact you again off list<br/>
