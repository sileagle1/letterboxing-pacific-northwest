A big THANKYOU to all the Spokane, WA area letterboxers who came out <br/>
for A Very Buggy Gathering.  It was so nice to meet the people <br/>
behind the stamps and LB journeys that I have enjoyed so much.<br/>
<br/>
A very special thank you to Homeschoolmommy who was the driving <br/>
force behind us.  I don't think we would have gone far without her <br/>
energy.  And, thanks Mike, for sharing Kim with us.  Another <br/>
big "Thanks!" goes to Blackvelvetray, who was so kind to make a <br/>
hitchhiker box for us to share at the gathering.  Keep your eyes <br/>
open for "Passionate About Pink", coming soon to a letterbox near <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the "photos" section on this site.  I forgot to pull out <br/>
the camera until we were pretty much done, but there are a couple to <br/>
share.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who made this such a fun day, it just goes <br/>
to show that Letterboxers (of any age) are just about the nicest <br/>
people you'll ever meet.<br/>
