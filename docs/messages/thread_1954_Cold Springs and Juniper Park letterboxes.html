  The Cold Springs and Juniper Park letterboxes have gone missing. <br>
The Cold Springs box was apparently destroyed be an unneeded forest <br>
service controlled burn. They had burned the area a few years ago and <br>
there wasn't much brush that had grown back, but they burned the <br>
place again anyway. I could find no sign of my box when I checked. <br>
The whole area around the spring is kind of ugly right now.<br>
  The Juniper Park boxes were likely vandalized. Someone reported <br>
that they found the boxes, but they were empty. Today when I checked <br>
I couldn't even find the boxes.<br>
  I hope to place new boxes in these areas again soon. The Cold <br>
Springs box will probably be placed some where in the campground next <br>
time so it will be less likely to burn again.<br>

So sorry to hear about your missing boxes. I am glad however to have found <br>
all of them before they went missing. I really enjoyed your Cold Springs box <br>
especially.  Looking forward to some great replacements!<br>
