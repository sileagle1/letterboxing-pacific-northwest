Just got home from Corvallis where I planted two new boxes and was thrilled<br>
to do the Camp Adair series.  This is a fabulous series dedicated to the men<br>
that perished defending our country.  Very nice carving job by a newer<br>
boxer.  I also picked up a hitchhiker while I was there.<br>
<br>
If you get the chance to get down to Corvallis/Philomath, there's definitely<br>
some nice boxes down there.  I believe we're up to a dozen, might be worth a<br>
road trip!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were fortunate to spend the weekend at the coast. I came away with 7<br>
stamps, all of which were fantastic. I don't think I've had a better<br>
letterboxing trip. The crowning glory of the weekend was Lemony Snicket's<br>
box, Bad Beginnings. The clues, the location, the book in it, and the stamp<br>
were so far above anything I've seen so far that I can't even begin to<br>
describe them. if you get the chance, it's well worth the effort!<br>
<br>
Don't miss out on One Eyed Willie, Cannon Beach, Fort Canby Lighthouse<br>
Series, or Lewis and Clark in Washington! Thank you to all the placers for<br>
leading me to such awesome locations.<br>

  A really good cure for stinging nettles is to shave the offended<br>
  area.  Maybe we should all pack some Bic's in with our other<br>
  letterboxing gear??<br>

Most of the boxes were "checkups" for The Brat Pack, but it gave us a chance<br>

falling apart and the nut on the log book is missing.<br>
Swan Lake is missing. Tooth Fairy was very sad to see that her very first<br>

A Rose By Any Other Name was found safe and sound. It's had several<br>
visitors, but none since last April.<br>
Yellow Rose of Suffrage was found safe and sound. It is happily awaiting<br>
visitors. The Brat Pack would like to thank all those that have left such<br>
wonderful messages.<br>
<br>
Our last attempt for the day was Multnomah Falls, but the rain and time ran<br>
out on us before we could find it. That one will have to wait for another<br>
day.<br>

I hope others got out on Saturday to enjoy the weather and get some fresh<br>
air. It's been a long time since we've heard about anyone's travels. Let's<br>
hear what you've found lately.<br>

<br>
    I made it out to Gresham on Saturday too.  We<br>
found  Feliz Navidad - which is pretty amazing since<br>
my Spanish is extremely rusty. (The box is getting<br>
rusty too, but the logbook is intact.)  We also<br>
checked out Jay's Toolbox.  Too much fun!  There are<br>
15 tools residing in that little  box. I want to add<br>
another one, but didn't have any carving tools on<br>
hand.<br>
I'll be back!<br>
<br>
Regards,Miniles<br>
