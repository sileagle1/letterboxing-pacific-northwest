I'm still learning this hobby, but I've gotten my classroom of 7th graders interested, too.  <br/>
This Sunday we will be participating in a community clean-up as part of a "service" project.  <br/>
Not having much luck finding any letterboxes near our assigned park.  Have found several <br/>
geocache sites that might work with the kids, but would like to also have them exposed to <br/>
Letterboxing...  We'll be working in Roegner Park on the Stuck River, just downriver from <br/>
the Game Farm Park.  OR if there are any boxes in the Game Farm Park, they'd be great, <br/>
too.  I'd like them to be close to where we'll already be so parents don't have to drive far <br/>
from our "work" site.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  The closest lettebox I'm finding is Flaming Geyser... and that's a bit farther <br/>
than I wanted to trot.<br/>
