                    <div class="plaintext-content">We should schedule some fund raising events, so we can bring our hero Wes out <br/>
to a gathering, so we can properly thank him for his great efforts.  Car washes <br/>
after letterboxing, first aid on the trails, personal protection services <br/>
for 'boxers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, would donate all proceeds from my new profession, Professional <br/>
Letterbox Expedition Guide (PLEG).  Take various groups and people out into the <br/>
wilds to hunt the elusive letterbox.  Hopefully won't be too swamped with <br/>
business.<br/>
<br/>
Although rumors of my letterbox woes may be running rampant (don't know the <br/>
difference between clockwise and counter; Southwest and Southeast confuse me; <br/>
as Nailhead so kindly pointed out, went the wrong way on the loop train at <br/>
Agate Beach (a very nice, but quite small, park, with a 1/4 +/- mile loop <br/>
trail); being 6 for 12 on Funhog's boxes; North is always toward the water, <br/>
except in Tacoma; etc.) I hope that the people interested in obtaining my <br/>
services will know any better.<br/>
<br/>
See you at the gatherings, with my new brochure :-)<br/>

Fudrick<br/>
&gt; Nailhead and Happy Mom got a much needed weekend getaway <br/>
&gt; to the San Juan Islands this weekend and took the oportunity to <br/>
&gt; do some letterbox maintenance and place some new boxes too.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are happy to declare that our first 2 Agate Beach boxes are <br/>
&gt; alive and well and have recieved a total of 1 visitor each!!  A <br/>
&gt; group of elementary school girls stumbled upon one of our <br/>
&gt; boxes  back in February of this year and took it to their adult <br/>
&gt; leader.  The girls, and leader, later returned with a stamp and <br/>
&gt; signed in.  New converts!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While there, we relocated one of the boxes to a better hiding area <br/>
&gt; and modified the clues to make them more descript so that <br/>
&gt; Fudrick can actually find them on his next trip up there.  We also <br/>
&gt; placed 2 more boxes at this lovely location to try to draw more <br/>
&gt; people there.  Hopefully 4 boxes at one small park on Lopez will <br/>
&gt; be attractive enough to get people out there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the way back to Anacortes we were blessed with some extra <br/>
&gt; Island Time when we (and about 100 other travelers) had to wait <br/>
&gt; thru 3 ferries to board back for the mainland.  An extra 2 1/2 <br/>
&gt; hours on Lopez!!! Yeehawww!  Just enough time to carve another <br/>
&gt; stamp and find a suitable hiding spot near the ferry terminal for <br/>
&gt; bored travelers to find in the future.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See the clues to all the boxes on the new LBNA site.<br/>

&gt; Happy Boxing,<br/>
