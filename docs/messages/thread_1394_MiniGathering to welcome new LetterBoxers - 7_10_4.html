Trainer!  If your recall is as good as your assuredness of being at <br>
the exact right spot for a box, see below :-)<br>
<br>
Her LetterBoxing class is going to be in Longview.  The final exam <br>
is going to a local park to find some LetterBoxes.  She has invited <br>
others to join in welcoming the Newbies.  This fun event will be <br>
Saturday, July 10th (see the Longview Parks and Rec website for <br>
details).<br>
<br>
She has some very specific rules for this gathering.  They are:<br>
<br>
This is a paid class, for the paying students.  Funhog obtained <br>
permission for other LBers to join in to welcome the Newbies, but <br>
the Newbies get first chance at the boxes.  They get the clues at <br>
1:00 (start of class), we can show up at the park at 2:30 to get <br>
clues and find boxes.  We can meet somewhere nearby and carpool to <br>
the park, arriving just before 2:30, or show up individually, <br>
arriving just before 2:30.  The main point here is to arrive no <br>
earlier than just before 2:30.  A prefunction, postfunction, or <br>
hunting of other area boxes is not out of the question, it just <br>
can't be at the park the class is being held at.<br>
<br>
She has permission to keep the gate open later than 4:00 for this <br>
event.  We will all (Oldbies and Newbies) gather back at the <br>
beginning point at 4ish to meet and greet the Newbies, swap tales <br>
and exploits, convince them that LetterBoxing is the greatest sport <br>
there is, congratulate Funhog on her fine class, get the award-<br>
winning event stamp, and perform the exchange ritual.<br>
<br>
Wake Robin is a fairly small park used for environmental learning by <br>
kids and parks and rec groups and others in the Kelso-Longview <br>
area.  We will need to be on our best behavior, proving that <br>
LetterBoxing is eco-friendly, by being good stewards of the <br>
environment and the park.  So, everyone should be especially careful <br>
about going off trail, disrupting plants, rocks, logs, etc.  She <br>
worked hard to get permission to leave these letterboxes on the <br>
property indefinitely, not just for this one day. However, bad<br>
behavior will get us 86ed, and possibly create a bad reputation that <br>
will spread to other Parks and Rec Departments.<br>
<br>
She will publish the directions to Wake Robin shortly before July <br>
7th, when she gets home from yet another road trip (the sun came <br>
out, a letterboxing we will go). The clues will be available at 2:30 <br>
at the park.  This is to avoid the temptation to go early and claim <br>
firsties.  Firsties have been reserved for the students, so they can <br>
have the thrill of finding new boxes.  Show up just before 2:30 and <br>
you will have your chance.<br>
<br>
How much fun could a fun hog hog if a funhog could hog fun?  Even <br>
with these requrirements, Funhog would still have a great time.<br>
<br>
Come join the fun and welcome the Newbies.  See you there!!!<br>
<br>

PS:  Funhog may have more information and/or requirements, they will <br>
be included with the directions or other informative communications.<br>
