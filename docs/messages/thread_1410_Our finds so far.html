 Well we have been officially bit by the letterboxing bug this year. <br/>
We have been successful at finding the Springwater trail #1 and # 2. <br/>
These were fun and very kid friendly. We just had to watch for all <br/>
the people going back and forth.<br/>
 Next we figured out the Bugle Mystery Letterbox. This one was fun <br/>
because it was our first harder one that we have done. <br/>
 Then one a weekend adventure we headed to Seaside where we found the <br/>
Seaside Carousel Letterbox, This one definetly took patience. We then <br/>
headed out to Cannon Beach and found the Ecola Letterbox. We also <br/>
found a geocache so that was intresting to see what that was about. <br/>
The geocache was so plain in site that we hid it a little better. <br/>
Then we headed home but even though it was getting dark we had to <br/>
stop and get the Picea Sitchensis Letterbox. We tried to get this one <br/>
last year but it was when it was missing. We had to use a flashlight <br/>
but we just couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't get it this <br/>
trip and we were rewarded with a great stamp. Right now we are in <br/>
pursuit of the Mother May I series which is very hard. We have been <br/>
successful with the first stamp so far but we are determined to get <br/>
them all. Thankfully we live just a 15 minute walk away. We are <br/>
excited about all the new letterboxes planted out in our area now. <br/>
There is so much to keep us busy. We are getting closer to wanting to <br/>
plant some of our own but just ahven't had the time to do that yet <br/>
with our 2 little babies in tow. Maybe soon we will plant some. I am <br/>
really liking carving stamps. Well happy hunting all.<br/>
