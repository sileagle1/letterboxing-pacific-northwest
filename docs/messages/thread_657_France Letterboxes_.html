Poof I am going to France at the end of September to visit company <br/>

manager of the new facility asked me if I would like to spend a few <br/>
extra days in France, on them.<br/>

Well after I gabbled and picked myself up I didn't give a coherent <br/>

So I guess OUI! I would love to spend a few extra daze in Paris.<br/>

Now, are there any letterboxes there?  I only found two out on the <br/>

It's not that I'm trying to limit posts to strictly Pacific Northwest topics, but there might actually be people in the rest of the country that know of French letterboxes that don't read this board.<br/>
<br/>
I'd even suggest posting to Letterboxing Earth rather than Letterboxing North America since France is clearly out of North America, but since I don't know of a Letterboxing Earth board, Letterboxing North America seems like the next best choice.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Totally off topic...  <br/>
<br/>
Hey, and get this, I'm on top of New Hampshire!!!  =)  Yep, at the very summit of Mount Washington.  I was thinking of hiding a letterbox up here but how do those plastic boxes hold up to 231 mph winds?  Between the cold AND the wind chill, I would think it would turn anything plastic into something as brittle as gingerbread.  So perhaps I should hide a box somewhere else instead...<br/>
