                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went to Oxbow Park this afternoon to check on 8 boxes of the Great <br>
Outdoors series.  I found hundreds of people along the banks of the <br>
Sandy, almost none on the trails, and 4 deer including a fawn.  But <br>
back to the boxes:  7 were dry and exactly as I placed them a year <br>
ago.  (Gosh I wish that Dollar Tree still had those cheap little <br>
watertight containers, they are perfect letterboxes).<br>
<br>
Has anyone found box #8 lately?  It appears to be missing.  I'm <br>
hopeful that someone has hidden it nearby and I've just missed it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Great Outdoors has fallen into disrepair.  Paintballers, animals, <br>
chance encounters... have left a few boxes in this big series, <br>
missing.  I've checked on about half the boxes about a week ago, and <br>
will check the remaining boxes if the weather would give me a chance.  <br>
Two are in the Gorge and the weather there can be dicey in winter, and <br>
I suspect that the box near Horsetail Falls is missing.  <br>
<br>
I'll post when my clean-up is complete.  I'll admit I'm a fair-weather <br>
boxer, so give me a few weekends at least!<br>
