My parents live in Mac, so I was there with family on 10/8 this year and<br>
found Turkeyrama (great box!!!!) and Feeling Frisky. That one took us a<br>
couple of tries--so many stairs, so many Y's....but we found it as well.<br>
Loved it!<br>
<br>
We also looked for Wortman's Favorite Animal, but couldn't find it. I felt<br>
pretty confident about the location, aligned with the drainpipe as stated,<br>
but found only debris in the tree. Any hints? Was I even remotely close or<br>
just out of luck?<br>

<br>
Thanks for letting me know--I looked it up on the LbNA website and it says<br>
it's "replanted" as of early November--and I was there in October. So maybe<br>
it had gone missing and is now back? Or then, I could have been looking in<br>
entirely the wrong place! :-) I'll try it again on Sunday and see what I<br>
find.<br>
