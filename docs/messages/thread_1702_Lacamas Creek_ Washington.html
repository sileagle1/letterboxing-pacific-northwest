I finally got around to revisiting my letterbox at Lacamas Creek, in <br>
Washington state today.  I have revised the clues to reflect changes <br>
in the local terrain.<br>

As you may know, I have a long-standing commitment to helping pass <br>
along my devious and merciless ways to the next generation of <br>
letterboxers.  Consequently, I took my latest understudy, Sim Kitty <br>
of Team Chaos, along with me today.  While we were there, we managed <br>
to place a second letterbox along the same creek.  We make a wicked <br>
team, Sim Kitty and I... we truly doubt if ANY of you will EVER be <br>
able to find this one!  Go ahead... knock yourselves out!  We dare <br>
you.<br>
