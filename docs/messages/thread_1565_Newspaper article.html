<br/>
Well, 'horrible' seems a bit harsh, but I agree that it is a misnomer <br/>
to say that letterboxing is 'all about' one or two aspects of the <br/>
hobby.  It is about many different things to different people and at <br/>
different times.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in my case, sometimes, the hiking aspect of it is very <br/>
important to me.  That's when I try to find (or place) a box that is <br/>
out on a hiking trail.  Other times, I'm in the mood for something a <br/>
little more domestic, like a quaint walk in the park with my nephew.  <br/>
Then I really prefer to hunt (or plant) a nearby local box.<br/>
<br/>
If I were going to make any attempt to simplify what it's 'all about' <br/>
to me, personally, I would have to say that letterboxing is about <br/>
sharing an experience with others.  One person likes a location <br/>
enough to plant a box there.  Later, other people come to that same <br/>
location trying to find it.  In the process, they partake in the <br/>
enjoyment of the area.  Then they add their name (stamp) to the list <br/>
(logbook) of people who have had the pleasure of sharing the <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
But that's just my opinion.  We each have different opinions, none <br/>
more valid than another.  As for me, I appreciate a beautifully <br/>
carved stamp, but that's not really important.  I am also happy to <br/>
find a crudely carved stamp.  I actually do care about the number of <br/>
stamps I collect, since each one is a keepsake of an experience I <br/>
shared with one or more other people.  But, again, that's just my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I thought the article was well-written, and I was glad to <br/>
see how much emphasis was placed on respecting the environment on <br/>
which we tread.  Very nice.<br/>

like being given the answers either -- a little help now and then is not bad<br/>
though. Heck I've heard rumors that certain letterboxers even have personal<br/>
stamps that you can only get it you have given them a hint they would not<br/>
have otherwise had.  Being that the article did not say what the clue was,<br/>
which wingding font was used (and there are 100s of them), or where the box<br/>
was located, I don't consider it anymore a spoiler than you telling us that<br/>
there are other letterboxes that use the same method of coding, :) So now we<br/>
all know that people use fonts to crypt clues -- finding what font they used<br/>
is an entirely different matter.  Heck -- I have a few clues myself that do<br/>
that -- I don't think telling you that makes the clue any easier though ;)<br/>

Holy Smokes Iron`Bear -- I think someone needs an Iron`Bear decoder ring to<br/>
decipher those typos! It's sort of funny though how often we type the same<br/>

different computers.... Maybe that's why I married you... Because you think<br/>

Good evening fellow Boxers<br/>
<br/>
Personally Funhog I think you just gave away a lot more than the news<br/>
article ever did, especially when the article was referencing someone's clue<br/>
with their expressed permission. Now you are telling us that is not only is<br/>
just one clue such as this but two. Yes? Do you see my point? There would<br/>
have been people that would have pasted right over that little tid bit of<br/>
information - if nothing was ever said to begin with. This is my personally<br/>
opinion take it for what it is worth. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well. <br/>

<br/>
Since I don't have a hard copy of this newspaper, I am unable to read the<br/>
entire <br/>
article. However, the quotes attributed to Campfire Lady and Ms. Zeutenhorst<br/>
in the <br/>
online version are right on. They do emphasize quite well the need for<br/>
environmental <br/>
awareness and secrecy. On the other hand, I believe that printing spoilers<br/>
is anything <br/>
but secretive. <br/>
<br/>
Even if the clue referenced by the reporter was freely given by one of these<br/>
boxers the <br/>
reporter's spoiler affects more than one letterbox. I know of at least one<br/>
other box <br/>
where this is the case. Personally, I don't like to be given the solution to<br/>
a puzzling <br/>
clue unless I've worked for it.  It was probably just a silly mistake but it<br/>
jumped right <br/>
out at me as I read the article. Funhog<br/>

&gt; them?<br/>
<br/>
I just didn't like the quote about letterboxing being "all about" the <br/>
number of stamps one can get.  The article didn't include who's <br/>
opinion that was, and it seems to imply that all letterboxers feel <br/>
that way.  And I don't.  Which makes it feel like *I'm* being <br/>
misquoted.  I know the numbers are a big part of the game for many <br/>
people--I don't even have a problem with that.  But I don't like how <br/>
it suggests that all letterboxers feel this way, because it's not <br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have a problem with the wingdings comment mostly because I <br/>
assumed the clue must have told the person to use wingdings to solve <br/>
the clue.  I'd never seen the clue myself to realize it was actually <br/>
a spoiler.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the article I'm prefectly content and happy with.  Sorry <br/>
if I don't do enough back patting and hold holding, but you know what <br/>
they say--no news is good news.  If I don't say anything about the <br/>
rest of the article, it's probably because I'm quite okay with it.  =)<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the article was just fine and dandy.  Stressing the <br/>
secrecy and environmental aspects is a good thing--but virtually all <br/>
letterboxing articles I've seen do that.  I've gotten bored of <br/>
saying, "Job well done" for every letterboxing article I read.  <br/>
*shrug*  This is actually the first time I've read something from a <br/>
letterboxing article that didn't sit with me the right way, and it <br/>
was just a small part of the whole.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not even blaming the people who were interviewed.  I don't know <br/>
if they really said that, or if it was something the reporter made <br/>
up.  Without a source of the quote, I don't know who to blame.  (Not <br/>
that that really matters.  It's the quote itself I don't like--not <br/>
necessarily the person who made it.  I like to fight issues, not <br/>
people.)<br/>
<br/>
But gee, Pandora, you seem a bit sensitive on the subject.  It wasn't <br/>
per chance you that made the comment, was it.  ;o)<br/>

hesitant for the very reason that I would probably be scrutinized by <br/>
a select bunch of letterboxers (and it looks like that is the case), <br/>
but I decided to do so because I wanted to make sure that an emphasis <br/>
on preserving the environment and the "correct" way to letterbox was  <br/>
fully emphasized in the article. I also wanted to emphasize the fact <br/>
that this is a fun hobby that brings together the family in an <br/>
outdoor setting where children as well as adults can learn about the <br/>
environment, wildlife in the Pacific Northwest, orienteering and be <br/>
able to spend quality time together. The reporter that wrote the <br/>
article has never been letterboxing before that day and probably did <br/>
not realize that there was such a secrecy to the clues and maybe I <br/>
didn't emphasize that as much as the main points that I was trying to <br/>
get across. If anything, the clue and box that "possibly" were <br/>
jeopardized were my own but now it seems that there may have been <br/>
another box jeopardized because of the comments made by someone else. <br/>
I don't believe there will be a problem since the clues to both boxes <br/>
are not the same. I did not ask the reporter to print about the <br/>
clues, that was done on her own, my main concern at the moment was <br/>
making sure that the enviroment was respected and the family aspect <br/>
was written about.<br/>
Geesh! You can't do anything here without someone getting offended or <br/>
being slammed for trying to do something good. That was the main <br/>
reason the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp was created also so <br/>
that the right information was given about letterboxing and that <br/>
people who are new to the hobby are educated enough to do the <br/>
hobby "correctly" and not go out and unwittingly destroy the <br/>
environment. <br/>
Forgive me if I offended anyone. I was not intentionally trying to <br/>
destroy this wonderful hobby that I and my daughter enjoy so much.<br/>
If you have a problem with the article, maybe you could call the <br/>
reporter and have her print a rebuttle. I have her name and phone <br/>
number and I would be happy to give it to you.<br/>

This quote I assure was not from me. My comment to the reporter about <br/>
the hobby in my eyes is NOT about the number of stamp images you <br/>
collect, but the places that you are taken to and the creativity of <br/>
the stamp images. In all honesty, It used to be about the numbers <br/>
when I first started because reaching a milestone of 100 boxes was a <br/>
huge step. Now that I have reached that goal, It all seems so trivial <br/>
to try to get more stamp images that others. I am here to collect the <br/>
wonderful images that others have painstakingly but thier whole heart <br/>
and soul into  for the enjoyment of others.<br/>
If anything, this was a misquote by the reporter. I wish people would <br/>
go directly to the source first and privately before posting and <br/>
slamming others publicly. This is how flame wars get started.<br/>

Don't worry too much about it.  You can't make everyone happy, and <br/>
it's not even worth trying if you want my opinion.  Just do what you <br/>
think is right, and do it to the best of your abilities, and then you <br/>

And also keep in mind--two people can have differing opinions on a <br/>

<br/>
No article can represent *every* boxer -- but if articles are going to<br/>
be written anyway (and clearly they are -- witness the Time article),<br/>
I'd rather they be written with voices from the field.<br/>

<br/>
When I was asked to be interviewed for this article I was somewhat <br/>
hesitant for the very reason that I would probably be scrutinized by <br/>
a select bunch of letterboxers (and it looks like that is the case), <br/>
but I decided to do so because I wanted to make sure that an emphasis <br/>
on preserving the environment and the "correct" way to letterbox was  <br/>
fully emphasized in the article. I also wanted to emphasize the fact <br/>
that this is a fun hobby that brings together the family in an <br/>
outdoor setting where children as well as adults can learn about the <br/>
environment, wildlife in the Pacific Northwest, orienteering and be <br/>
able to spend quality time together. The reporter that wrote the <br/>
article has never been letterboxing before that day and probably did <br/>
not realize that there was such a secrecy to the clues and maybe I <br/>
didn't emphasize that as much as the main points that I was trying to <br/>
get across. If anything, the clue and box that "possibly" were <br/>
jeopardized were my own but now it seems that there may have been <br/>
another box jeopardized because of the comments made by someone else. <br/>
I don't believe there will be a problem since the clues to both boxes <br/>
are not the same. I did not ask the reporter to print about the <br/>
clues, that was done on her own, my main concern at the moment was <br/>
making sure that the enviroment was respected and the family aspect <br/>
was written about.<br/>
Geesh! You can't do anything here without someone getting offended or <br/>
being slammed for trying to do something good. That was the main <br/>
reason the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp was created also so <br/>
that the right information was given about letterboxing and that <br/>
people who are new to the hobby are educated enough to do the <br/>
hobby "correctly" and not go out and unwittingly destroy the <br/>
environment. <br/>
Forgive me if I offended anyone. I was not intentionally trying to <br/>
destroy this wonderful hobby that I and my daughter enjoy so much. If<br/>
you have a problem with the article, maybe you could call the <br/>
reporter and have her print a rebuttle. I have her name and phone <br/>
number and I would be happy to give it to you.<br/>

every time you do something within our community you get scrutinized and<br/>

not constructive criticism, but malicious criticism.  And when it happens in<br/>
a way like this -- where the complaint is more harmful to the hobby than the<br/>
original faux paux, it only makes the people complaining look like<br/>
hypocrites. We don't want this, and I doubt you and yours want it either<br/>
Ryan, you want people to listen when you talk, to gain knowledge from you<br/>
experiences, that is what I've gathered when speaking to you and others --<br/>
if that is what you want, then you have to treat people in a manner that is<br/>
proactive to your cause. Lead by example, be the paradigm, be part of the<br/>
solution, not part of the problem.  Otherwise if people don't listen when<br/>
you talk, it's nobody's fault but your own. Just for the record though --<br/>
agreeing and listening are two different things! Haha I listen to everything<br/>
Ryan, Funhog and other experienced boxers say, I just don't always agree<br/>
with them - as exampled on this article thread!<br/>

Yeah, that's about it.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry too much about it.  You can't make everyone happy, and <br/>
it's not even worth trying if you want my opinion.  Just do what you <br/>
think is right, and do it to the best of your abilities, and then you <br/>
can feel good about yourself regardless of what others think.  When <br/>
it comes right down to it, it's how you feel about yourself that <br/>
counts the most!<br/>
<br/>
And also keep in mind--two people can have differing opinions on a <br/>
subject and still be friends.  Lord knows Funhog and Amanda don't <br/>
approve of all my doings, but they still slept with me a couple of <br/>
weeks ago!  ;o)<br/>

The truth is that with any hobby/sport there are those that live by the law <br/>
and those that live by the spirit of the law.  And those that are in between.<br/>
<br/>
If I hadn't had a 6 hour workshop to attend on Saturday I would have been <br/>
up there enjoying the camp (with my daughter) and loving every minute of <br/>
it... well, except the part where a child went and misplaced himself! LOL<br/>

I hope that you put on another camp some time... It will be a priority for me!<br/>
