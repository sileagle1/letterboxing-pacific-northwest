work and organization put in by Paisley Orca, John, Funhog and all <br/>
others involved with making "Stamp Camp '03" a huge success!<br/>
<br/>
It was great to see old friends again and meet new ones too, and we <br/>
hope to see you all again soon... perhaps even on trail.<br/>
<br/>
As per Funhog's lead, I posted all the photos Beth and I took of the <br/>
weekend event.  We didn't manage to get everybody who attended, but I <br/>
think we did get everyone who swung the stick at those pinatas, kids <br/>
and adults alike!<br/>
<br/>
Until next time...<br/>
<br/>
Mark &amp; Beth<br/>
