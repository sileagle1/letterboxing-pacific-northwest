We are anxious to get the Powell's box too, but as time is in short supply,  other priorities unfortunately come first.......   <br/>

Since the gauntlet was cast at my feet, I went down to Powell's a<br/>
little while ago. Sad to say, the letterbox is missing. Hopefully,<br/>
Iron Bear and Pandora won't be discouraged and will try a more secure<br/>
spot for their next effort. I am dying to see what their stamps look<br/>
like. My condolences.... Funhog<br/>

Missing?!  Already?!  *sigh*  Since it's missing, can you tell us a <br/>
little about the hiding spot?  I'm very curious as to how large the <br/>
box was and how they tried to hide it from random customers and <br/>
employees.  <br/>

<br/>
We were there on March 16.  Some of the individual clues stumped us, <br/>
however there was enough detail in the final clue that we located the <br/>
box anyway.  It was a plastic pencil pouch velcro'ed in place, in a more <br/>
or less concealed location.  It was visible, but inconspicuous.  I don't <br/>
want to say too much about the location, in case it is going to be <br/>
replaced.  <br/>
<br/>
Powell's is a great place for a letterbox (or two or three), and I <br/>
expect the staff would be all for it if asked.  I hope we will see more <br/>
there in the future.<br/>

<br/>
If one is hiding a letterbox inside a business without permission, I <br/>
should think "visible, but inconspicuous" isn't good enough.  <br/>
Downright invisible would work better.<br/>
<br/>
I do hope the box gets replaced--or even a series of two or three <br/>
boxes at Powells created--but without official permission, they'll <br/>
have to be invisible!  An employee might be totally thrilled about a <br/>
letterbox being in the store, but if they found it by accident, they <br/>
might end up throwing it away not realizing what a prize it really is!<br/>
<br/>
Should we hold a memorial service for the sad demise of the letterbox?<br/>
