Also, has anyone else noticed that Campfire brand marshmellows do NOT burn!  We were bummed,  I like to flame broil my schmallows. You cannot do this with them.  We even set one on a log in the fire - NOTHING, in fact, it was still there a small whitish lump on a charred log in the morning!  We stay away from Campfire marshmellows now and only buy the cheap ones, you can still get them to flame and burn!    <br>
