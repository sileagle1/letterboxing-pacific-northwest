the canyon between Ellensburg and Yakima. I left two letterboxes behind the next <br/>
morning. As yet, I have heard not a peep about either of them. That part of the state <br/>
is definitely crying for more... <br/>
<br/>
I, for one, prefer boxes placed at least ten minutes apart. I'm always trying to use <br/>
letterboxing as an excuse for excercise. In the cold weather finding boxes placed <br/>
close together can be downright unpleasant since there is no time to warm up <br/>
walking from one to the next. However, I do know that some folks would rather find a <br/>
bunch than walk a couple of miles. To each his own...Funhog<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are many areas of the state being neglected, such as cascade <br/>
&gt; crest and eastern WA.  I set one in eastern WA to compliment one <br/>
&gt; placed by Fudrick.  A person could visit 2 different venues within 15 <br/>
&gt; miles of each other and have 2 different experiences ( riparian vs <br/>
&gt; upland grass zone).  I am pondering a third directly in the opposite <br/>
&gt; direction.  This would give a third totally different experience, a <br/>
&gt; pine forest all within 30 miles.  <br/>

Had it not been 16* and blanketed with 2' of snow last week and the <br/>
week before that, we would have attempted these new boxes.  <br/>
Unfortunately, they'll have to wait until we return to the area in <br/>
several months.  We did manage to locate the new arboreal abode <br/>
letterbox in Yakima and it was alive &amp; well and eagerly awaiting <br/>
visitors.<br/>
