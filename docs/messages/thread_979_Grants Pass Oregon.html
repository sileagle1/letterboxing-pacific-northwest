letterbox while there -- on Thanksgiving Day, thank you very much.  Its alive and <br/>
well.  (Funhog, I don't know if you remember what you wrote when you logged in <br/>
there, but my brother and his family think you rock!)  My niece and I were able <br/>
to plant a new box during that visit too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had as excellent a Thanksgiving as I did!<br/>
