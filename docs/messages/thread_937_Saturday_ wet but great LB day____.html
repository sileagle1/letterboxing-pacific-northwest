                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like you had a Great day!  Josh and I went out on a<br>
placing LB's outing. First we went down to Bend to try for<br>
Shelvin Park. We got to the park and realized that we had<br>
forgotten our LB backpack and the clues. We are going to<br>
try again today. We then placed our new TUMALO box and<br>
then replaced the new CLINE FALLS box. Josh got toshoot<br>
his BB gun and we had a ball. We saw 6 Mule Deer, very beautiful!<br>
Later,<br>
