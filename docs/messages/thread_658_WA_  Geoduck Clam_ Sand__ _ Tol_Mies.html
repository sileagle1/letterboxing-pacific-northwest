park.  I got there at around 5:30am and had to park outside the park <br>
and walk in. (avoided a $5 fee too! :0) <br>
I had the park to myself for several hours.  After finding Tol I <br>
misinterpreted a clue and took the wrong turn.  No problem.  I just <br>
headed up to the huckleberry bush to check it out.  Great shape as <br>
you said.  Then back to the junction.  Just before the junction is <br>
the long boardwalk.  There is a bench near the beginning of the long <br>
boardwalk that was just calling for me to have a seat.  Well, a seat <br>
turned in to a 1/2 hour nap.  What a treat to be alone in the forest!<br>
<br>
You are right, this THE PARK.<br>
