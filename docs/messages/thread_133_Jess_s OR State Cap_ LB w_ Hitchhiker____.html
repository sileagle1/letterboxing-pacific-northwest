back up soon enough!  The clue got lost from the LBNA page and it just got<br/>
back up today.<br/>
<br/>
Clue is at http://www.willamette.edu/~alorente/letterboxing/WU_box.html<br/>
<br/>
If anyones in the Salem area, I strongly recommend that you drop by WU, as<br/>
there are two boxes on campus and two more within a ten-minute walk of the<br/>
campus.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you might want to wait for a few days *wink*<br/>
I wont give details now, but there *may* be a series going in around here<br/>
