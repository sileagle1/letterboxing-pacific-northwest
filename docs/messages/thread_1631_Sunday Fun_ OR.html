                    <div class="plaintext-content">Phew! I finally got the opportunity to get to the Family <br/>
Forest Series in Oregon City. I've only had it on my <br/>
must do list for a year now. What a wonderful place! <br/>
It's far from any major roads, very quiet and there were <br/>
absolutely no other people on the trails. There were <br/>
mushroom gardens, newts and bunnies but nothing <br/>
that makes much noise other than a busy little creek.<br/>
<br/>
The next stop wasn't quite so idyllic but the beautiful<br/>
stamps made up for any lack of solitude. These were <br/>
Pandora's lovely, whimsical Peter Pan images in West <br/>
Linn. In spite of encountering a sizeable quantity of <br/>
fairy dust (squishy mud) there wasn't much rain until <br/>
the final lap of our journey.<br/>
<br/>
In our travels, Nutria, Oregon Trail, It's a Bird-It's a <br/>
Plane and I'd Lasso it for you all saw the light of day. <br/>
Thanks to all who contributed to a grand day of <br/>
letterboxing. Merci Beaucoup, Funhog<br/>
