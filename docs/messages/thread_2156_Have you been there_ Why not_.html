Maybe you've been there - maybe you haven't.<br/>
But nonetheless - get there and grab it.<br/>
It's got a first finder which I hope you will use.<br/>
If not they just might look good tied to your<br/>
shoes....<br/>
When out on the Green or while wondering at Blue<br/>
Drive in or Dive in - this letterbox is for you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LILY<br/>
<br/>
If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br/>
