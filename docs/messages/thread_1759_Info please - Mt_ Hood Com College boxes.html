Hi again everyone, just Bindle Babe dropping in to see how things <br>
are around my second favorite area of the country.<br>
<br>
Not to worry about your regional list being slow ... the Great Lakes <br>
regional list is slow as well, for the moment.<br>
<br>
I've been playing with Hexcat's database (from the big list) and <br>
wonder if someone can help me out with some info on the boxes we got <br>
while I was out there in Letterbox Heaven.<br>
<br>
The Mt. Hood Community College "dog" series ... <br>
I can't seem to find it on the letterboxing.org list using any of <br>
the search terms I've come up with.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know who placed this series and when?  Or, even <br>
better ... do you have the proper name of the series or a link?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
