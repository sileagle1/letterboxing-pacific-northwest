Hey Ya'll -<br/>
<br/>
I planted a box at PCC Sylvania as part of a "how to" demonstration speech for my class.  I give the speech on Wednesday but was hoping that someone would VISIT the box before then so that my classmates can get a feel for what it's like to see someone already stamped in.  I didn't want to use the three at PCC as examples since, of course, they aren't mine and also because they require a lot more to find then the one I did.  This is a DRIVEBY for people who know the campus.  <br/>
<br/>
So I guess I'm begging!!!! PLEASE.<br/>
<br/>
You can find it at letterboxing dot org under PCC SLIP<br/>

If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br/>
