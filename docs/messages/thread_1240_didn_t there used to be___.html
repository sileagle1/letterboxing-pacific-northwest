place to spend most of the day.  We were the 2nd ones to stamp in the <br/>
new log books.  <br/>
Both had been rehidden rather poorly.  Trout was right in the open <br/>
behind the log, no piece of wood, so we grabbed one from the other <br/>
side of the trail &amp; recovered it.  We met up with Mini Bob's Wife HH <br/>
from OR there.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to say, but the Elementals have not fared so well.  <br/>
<br/>
Fire Elemental:  <br/>
Was right where she should be &amp; we were really excited to see this <br/>
MOST AWESOME!!! stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Earth Elemental:<br/>
Couldn't wait to get to this next one however, the box, pad &amp; stamp <br/>
were missing.  The log book in an open bag was just sitting on top of <br/>
the stump it should have been behind.  We looked ALL around for any <br/>
trace of the missing items, Mike even went over the edge &amp; all the <br/>
way down to the bottom of the ravine.  When he came across a log that <br/>
a bear or some other very large animal had ripped to shreds &amp; had dug <br/>
a large den out below he decided to high tail it back up to the top.<br/>
We brought the soggy log book home with us &amp; it's sitting here drying <br/>
now.  My daughter wants me to photo copy the original stamp from <br/>
inside the cover so we can atleast have it in our books.  After that <br/>
I would like to return it to Mischief.  Contact me with how to do <br/>
that &amp; I can mail it or...  We live in Shoreline &amp; since we've <br/>
already found many of your boxes &amp; seen your stamp in others I'm <br/>
assuming you're from around here. <br/>
<br/>
Air Elemental:<br/>
Here it gets real weird.  Air stamp, pad &amp; log book were in place, <br/>
however they were in Water Elemental box &amp; slightly wet, we dried <br/>
everything off &amp; put it back.  Another great stamp.  I must say these <br/>
were my favorite stamps ever, but I'm really into fairies.<br/>
<br/>
Water Elemental: <br/>
Definately missing.  We found the flat rock &amp; the geocache right next <br/>
to the rock that had no box anywhere around, let alone under it.  The <br/>
geocache log book had many references to the box , stamp &amp; wondering <br/>
what it was.  Have to say it didn't give us any warm &amp; fuzzy feelings <br/>
about geocachers.  How can they not know about us when we all know <br/>
about them?  <br/>
Well all in all it was a great trail &amp; total of 4 really awesome <br/>
stamps plus a HH.  Also we found a Mystery Box at another stop <br/>
earlier.  Another great day of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 PS We found The Salmon Derby Mystery box last weekend &amp; it was a <br/>
great find with fun clues.<br/>

I'm glad that she's recarved Water, I would really love to fo out <br/>

Also, a note to anyone thinking about going after these boxes.  The <br/>
trail is named Trillium Trail &amp; right now thetrilliums are in bloom  <br/>
everywhere.  Any other time of the year you will not see any trace of <br/>
the trillium.  <br/>

&gt; We just got back from Watershed &amp; these were great.  Really nice <br/>
&gt; place to spend most of the day.  We were the 2nd ones to stamp in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; new log books.  <br/>
&gt; Both had been rehidden rather poorly.  Trout was right in the open <br/>
&gt; behind the log, no piece of wood, so we grabbed one from the other <br/>
&gt; side of the trail &amp; recovered it.  We met up with Mini Bob's Wife <br/>
HH <br/>
&gt; from OR there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry to say, but the Elementals have not fared so well.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fire Elemental:  <br/>
&gt; Was right where she should be &amp; we were really excited to see this <br/>
&gt; MOST AWESOME!!! stamp.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Earth Elemental:<br/>
&gt; Couldn't wait to get to this next one however, the box, pad &amp; stamp <br/>
&gt; were missing.  The log book in an open bag was just sitting on top <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; the stump it should have been behind.  We looked ALL around for any <br/>
&gt; trace of the missing items, Mike even went over the edge &amp; all the <br/>
&gt; way down to the bottom of the ravine.  When he came across a log <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; a bear or some other very large animal had ripped to shreds &amp; had <br/>
dug <br/>
&gt; a large den out below he decided to high tail it back up to the <br/>
top. We<br/>
&gt; brought the soggy log book home with us &amp; it's sitting here drying <br/>
&gt; now.  My daughter wants me to photo copy the original stamp from <br/>
&gt; inside the cover so we can atleast have it in our books.  After <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; I would like to return it to Mischief.  Contact me with how to do <br/>
&gt; that &amp; I can mail it or...  We live in Shoreline &amp; since we've <br/>
&gt; already found many of your boxes &amp; seen your stamp in others I'm <br/>
&gt; assuming you're from around here. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Air Elemental:<br/>
&gt; Here it gets real weird.  Air stamp, pad &amp; log book were in place, <br/>
&gt; however they were in Water Elemental box &amp; slightly wet, we dried <br/>
&gt; everything off &amp; put it back.  Another great stamp.  I must say <br/>
these <br/>
&gt; were my favorite stamps ever, but I'm really into fairies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Water Elemental: <br/>
&gt; Definately missing.  We found the flat rock &amp; the geocache right <br/>
next <br/>
&gt; to the rock that had no box anywhere around, let alone under it.  <br/>
The <br/>
&gt; geocache log book had many references to the box , stamp &amp; <br/>
wondering <br/>
&gt; what it was.  Have to say it didn't give us any warm &amp; fuzzy <br/>
feelings <br/>
&gt; about geocachers.  How can they not know about us when we all know <br/>
&gt; about them?  <br/>
&gt; Well all in all it was a great trail &amp; total of 4 really awesome <br/>
&gt; stamps plus a HH.  Also we found a Mystery Box at another stop <br/>
&gt; earlier.  Another great day of letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  PS We found The Salmon Derby Mystery box last weekend &amp; it was a <br/>
&gt; great find with fun clues.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The Pirate Family was there last Sunday &amp; found only # 3.  When we<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally did, the log book had many entries of not finding either <br/>
1 <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; 2, both, or some lucky finding all 3, so we're not sure if it was<br/>
&gt; us <br/>
&gt; &gt; or they indeed were mia.  We really thought we'd found where #1 <br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; hidden however the nurse had been poked at &amp; had parts ripped <br/>
down <br/>
&gt; &gt; with piles of rotted wood on the ground.  If we were in the right <br/>
&gt; &gt; place the box may have been buried.  We did find our first <br/>
geocache <br/>
&gt; &gt; though, right where we thought #1 should be, however we had <br/>
gotten <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; little confused here.  This had been visited the same day by some<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids with stamps.  Not sure if any connection with distruction to <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; earlier mentioned stump.  Hope I'm not saying too much, but as we<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't find them I feel ok. :)  Let me know what you find so we <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; &gt; try again as there are a couple more series right in the area at <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Redmond Watershed that we ran out of time for.  Can't wait for the<br/>
&gt; next gathering to meet some more of you &amp; really put faces with all <br/>
&gt; of you that we feel we know from your stamps &amp; boxes.<br/>
