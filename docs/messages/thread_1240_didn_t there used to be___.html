place to spend most of the day.  We were the 2nd ones to stamp in the <br>
new log books.  <br>
Both had been rehidden rather poorly.  Trout was right in the open <br>
behind the log, no piece of wood, so we grabbed one from the other <br>
side of the trail & recovered it.  We met up with Mini Bob's Wife HH <br>
from OR there.<br>
<br>
Sorry to say, but the Elementals have not fared so well.  <br>
<br>
Fire Elemental:  <br>
Was right where she should be & we were really excited to see this <br>
MOST AWESOME!!! stamp.  <br>
<br>
Earth Elemental:<br>
Couldn't wait to get to this next one however, the box, pad & stamp <br>
were missing.  The log book in an open bag was just sitting on top of <br>
the stump it should have been behind.  We looked ALL around for any <br>
trace of the missing items, Mike even went over the edge & all the <br>
way down to the bottom of the ravine.  When he came across a log that <br>
a bear or some other very large animal had ripped to shreds & had dug <br>
a large den out below he decided to high tail it back up to the top.<br>
We brought the soggy log book home with us & it's sitting here drying <br>
now.  My daughter wants me to photo copy the original stamp from <br>
inside the cover so we can atleast have it in our books.  After that <br>
I would like to return it to Mischief.  Contact me with how to do <br>
that & I can mail it or...  We live in Shoreline & since we've <br>
already found many of your boxes & seen your stamp in others I'm <br>
assuming you're from around here. <br>
<br>
Air Elemental:<br>
Here it gets real weird.  Air stamp, pad & log book were in place, <br>
however they were in Water Elemental box & slightly wet, we dried <br>
everything off & put it back.  Another great stamp.  I must say these <br>
were my favorite stamps ever, but I'm really into fairies.<br>
<br>
Water Elemental: <br>
Definately missing.  We found the flat rock & the geocache right next <br>
to the rock that had no box anywhere around, let alone under it.  The <br>
geocache log book had many references to the box , stamp & wondering <br>
what it was.  Have to say it didn't give us any warm & fuzzy feelings <br>
about geocachers.  How can they not know about us when we all know <br>
about them?  <br>
Well all in all it was a great trail & total of 4 really awesome <br>
stamps plus a HH.  Also we found a Mystery Box at another stop <br>
earlier.  Another great day of letterboxing.<br>

 PS We found The Salmon Derby Mystery box last weekend & it was a <br>
great find with fun clues.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, the clues said that Water was probably missing, but Air was <br>
there (just inside of the Water box in the Air spot) it was Earth <br>
that was missing. <br>
I'm glad that she's recarved Water, I would really love to fo out <br>
there again.<br>
Also, a note to anyone thinking about going after these boxes.  The <br>
trail is named Trillium Trail & right now thetrilliums are in bloom  <br>
everywhere.  Any other time of the year you will not see any trace of <br>
the trillium.  <br>
