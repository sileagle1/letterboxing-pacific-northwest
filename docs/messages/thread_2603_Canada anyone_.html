<br/>
I'm Kurious why so few people are signed up for the "Between the Forest and<br/>
the Sea" gathering in Canada at the end of the month.  It looks like a great<br/>
location on Google Earth, it's a chance to get a country added to your<br/>
count, etc. Do you Puget Sounders know something about crossing the border<br/>
that we don't?  We'd really like to know because we are thinking about<br/>
bringing our second home (motor home) across and if you guys are<br/>
apprehensive about just driving across, maybe we need to rethink this.    <br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from you all.  Backdoor me if you like.<br/>
Kurious Jo<br/>
