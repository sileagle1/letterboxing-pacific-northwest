<br/>
This past weekend we were able to check on a handful of LBs that we <br/>
pretty much thought were non-visited since we hadn't heard a peep <br/>
from folks who'd visited them since we'd placed most of them (minus <br/>
two emails from one dear soul who grew up in the region where a <br/>
couple of the boxes were hidden).<br/>
<br/>
The following boxes were alive &amp; well with many visitors:<br/>
<br/>
Anchor's Away<br/>
Broken Dreams<br/>
Sea Otter<br/>
Tluaniuq l*ake<br/>
Whale of a tree<br/>
<br/>
We also visited a few other new plants in the area:<br/>
<br/>
Riches at Rubeeeeeeeee  Bch<br/>
Elma Slug<br/>
<br/>
The rich letterbox was in dire shape as the last visitors failed to <br/>
close it properly and it got completely waterlogged.  We tried to <br/>
revive it as best we could but didn't have the opportunity to stay <br/>
there long enough to let the logbook dry completely.  Next visitors <br/>
please let it air dry some more.  It should do alright as long as it <br/>
gets a chance to recover properly.  The stamp was awesome and the <br/>
venue was one of the most beautiful we'd ever been to.  Definitely <br/>
worth the trip!!!<br/>
<br/>
Elma Slug was doing well and a great box sanctioned by the venue!<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, several of the boxes we placed were left with <br/>
plastic bags that were completely open!  Even double bagged but both <br/>
bags weren't closed at all!!!  The logbooks have no chance in that <br/>
environment without protection since it's the rainiest part of the <br/>
entire country.  Frustrating... Somebody even took a pen from one of <br/>
them?  Really frustrating because these boxes are almost orphans so <br/>
maintenance occurs in very long cycles.<br/>
<br/>
Another odd thing is that we really visited one of the boxes simply <br/>
because we hadn't heard from it and we knew we left a popular HH at <br/>
it this time last year.  We were stunned to visit the box, noticed <br/>
at least 15 folks had visited, yet the HH was still sitting right on <br/>
top of the LB.  None of the visitors had even stamped in to the <br/>
HH!!!  Odd.  Needless to say, we moved the HH on since it seemed to <br/>
be caught in a maelstrom of immobility.  Now, it should see the <br/>
light of day again and will perhaps float to a sunnier place in the <br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
For folks who yearn for a neat vacation to beautiful sites away from <br/>
traffic &amp; people, this trek should definitely be on your list.  We <br/>
essentially had the region to ourselves this trip.  Could it have <br/>
been due to outrageous gas prices???  The peacefulness of the trip <br/>
was definitely worth the extra cost of the gas.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails and possibly in Des Moines this weekend,<br/>
