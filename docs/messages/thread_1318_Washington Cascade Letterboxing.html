                    <div class="plaintext-content">I took a trip to the Yakima River Canyon in Washington over the weekend. It<br/>
was a time for flyfishing, birdwatching, camping and a little letterboxing<br/>
on the side.<br/>
<br/>
I field tested a new proto-type 6 person tent made by REI. It's huge, roomy<br/>
and lots of head room. Should be out in 2005.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to find one of the two Yakima River Canyon boxes. The second box<br/>
in the series now appears to be on posted Private Property. Dang. The first<br/>
box, has a beautful stamp in a wonderful creek valley. It really is a must,<br/>
if you're in the canyon.<br/>
<br/>
Then it was on to Umtanum Falls letterbox. Again it's in a beautiful,<br/>
peaceful spot. And the stamp is one of my favorites for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped by Irene Rhinehart Riverside Park for that letterbox. I was<br/>
unable to track it down.<br/>
<br/>
Two out of four is not bad.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great weekend in the Kittitas Valley.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, the fishing was most excellent.<br/>

Hear that, Amanda?  Sounds like your kind of tent!  =D<br/>

I should explain that I get claustrophobic in small 2 person tents. <br/>
(unless I drink a whole bottle of wine, then I pass out and it is not <br/>
a problem :-)I can't sleep in a mummy sleeping bag either. <br/>
<br/>
I can handle a tarp with no problem. (no walls!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is amazing that I can work in a Narrow Metal Tube at 35,000 feet <br/>
all day long.  Well, I just won't think about it....<br/>
