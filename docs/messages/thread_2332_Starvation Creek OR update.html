                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, I headed out to replace the missing box in this series and to<br>
add a new one while I was there. Well, I discovered that the<br>
'missing'box wasn't missing at all. I just couldn't find my own box<br>
when I checked on it last spring. Duh...<br>
<br>
That left me with TWO new boxes to hide since the intended replacement<br>
was different from the original. I accomplished the mission and there<br>
are now five(!) boxes for the intrepid to find. The creeks along this<br>
trail were too high today for me to get across so I couldn't check on<br>
#1. i could get to the others by going in the reverse direction. So, I<br>
guess you'll have to wait for the waters to receed a bit before you<br>
all beat a path to these. Funhog<br>
