all surprised to find your stamps still wet in the bonus logbook. <br>
Had I known that there was a replacement hippo, I would have nabbed <br>
that too.  Seems I am following your footsteps all around Olympia <br>
this weekend.  Got out to the capitol and got all 4 of the new boxes <br>
there.  Looks like #2 of the moon tree eluded you.  We got some <br>
funny looks ourselves by the state patrolman driving around the <br>
area.  We think we spotted another letterboxer who spotted us and <br>
decided to leave the area and come back later.  Too bad we didnt get <br>
a chance to ask about exchanges.<br>
<br>
We also finally solved an Orca Mystery.  Had it figured out the <br>
first time I read the clues but havent had a chance to get to that <br>
location until today. Nice stamp. Great location.  Tough to be <br>
secret there but kids always help to run diversions.<br>
<br>
All in all 4 out of 7 Nails got 6 new finds today!  A great day for <br>
inky fingers!<br>

We're going out this next weekend, if we're not moving this weekend, to find<br>
this new series and a few others in the Oly area.<br>
