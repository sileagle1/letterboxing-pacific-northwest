had a blast this last weekend, and all of you made it so special.  It <br/>
was really great to get to meet the faces behind the stamps! After <br/>
having taken some time out of boxing the past year, We were welcomed <br/>
back as if we had never been gone at all.  Our daughter had the time of <br/>
her life. Thanks go out to Heather especially for letting her play <br/>
endlessly with Little Bug!  The two shall become lifetime friends now I <br/>
have no doubt!  <br/>
<br/>
So many great times....  So many great folks!  I was thrilled to box <br/>
with Doublesaj and Old Blue! The time we spent was so fun, the hikes <br/>
gorgeous and I am so looking forward to the next time!  Happy Trails <br/>
everyone, and I hope to meet again real soon!   Wingnut<br/>

to the names, and enjoy the company and natural beauty. Well worth the <br/>
trip!<br/>

We'll carry a good relaxing weekend with us into the daily grind!<br/>
