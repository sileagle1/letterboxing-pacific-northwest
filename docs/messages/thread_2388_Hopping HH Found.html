through AQ.  I've sent an update to Pete and Wanda, but if you guys are out <br/>
there, the Hopping HH (Easter Bunnies 03) is alive and well, with quite a <br/>
bit of space left in the log book.  I think the placers may be from around <br/>
here, because it started its journey around Vancouver, WA.<br/>
<br/>
It's only been in Oregon and Washington so far.  Wish I could move it out of <br/>
state for you, but we'll see if we can leave it somewhere locally that gets <br/>
some traffic going elsewhere.<br/>

Heartsy, and Daisy back on April, 18, 2004. When we found it in the <br/>
Troutdale area there was no logbook with it and no one to contact <br/>
about it. We made an attempt to find the owner but were unsuccessful <br/>
so whoever owns it is a mystery. A logbook was created for it so it <br/>
may keep on traveling. Willow and kids aren't letterboxing all that <br/>
much anymore so they are probably not reading this message. I hope <br/>
this information helps.<br/>
