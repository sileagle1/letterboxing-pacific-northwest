Faces, I wasn't sure we were still on the right trail and a friend had<br/>
called from the parking lot so we headed straight for the car to meet up<br/>
with them.  Or at least we THOUGHT we were headed for the car ;)  AND, I was<br/>
perfectly happy to go home with 4 boxes found and 3 stamps exchanged! I plan<br/>
on going back and finding the rest of the Jurassic Park series and the<br/>
Making Faces, as soon as I have more eyes with me to help decipher clues and<br/>
look through wet leaves ;)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, Sleepy Whippet told me where to get a cover for my<br/>
journal, but I forgot in all the excitement.  Does anyone know?<br/>
