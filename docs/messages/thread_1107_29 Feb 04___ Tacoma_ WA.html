<br/>
Leaf from Frontiers to Fantasy LB Gathering<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Day:Sunday, February 29th<br/>
&gt; Place: Pt. Defiance Park (Tacoma, WA)<br/>
&gt;        Kitchen Shelter at NeverNeverLand/Ft.Nisqually<br/>
&gt; Time: 1pm-4pm (Main Event)<br/>
&gt;       <br/>
&gt; The name for this event is geared around Leap Year, NeverNeverLand <br/>
&gt; and Ft. Nisqually. We are planning on this being a potluck <br/>
luncheon. <br/>
&gt; Each family/person needs to bring their own plates,utensils, <br/>
hot/cold <br/>
&gt; drinks and a potluck dish to share.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are aware that this is a Sunday event and that some may have <br/>
&gt; church schedules to attend and thus we have proposed the later 1pm <br/>
&gt; start time. We figure some people may come early to hunt/place <br/>
boxes, <br/>
&gt; eat then leave or some may come at 1pm eat, box, exchange, chat and <br/>
&gt; maybe place a box or two even! Some may come early and stay the <br/>
whole <br/>
&gt; day!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The kitchen/shelter has running water and a bathroom nearby, plenty <br/>
&gt; of parking and a nice starting place for many boxes that could be <br/>
&gt; clustered/hidden nearby! I know that I've already staked out about <br/>
3 <br/>
&gt; different areas I'd like to hide some boxes!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bring clues to boxes may hide for the event and feel free to carve <br/>
&gt; event stamps if you are so inclined. The park has many wonderful <br/>
&gt; boxes already hidden in various locations. We figure that the <br/>
&gt; Fantasy/Frontier theme may even inspire a few more!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So..get your carving tools out, boxes placed, clues ready and be <br/>
&gt; prepared to join us for a once in every four years day of leap year <br/>
&gt; boxing! We want this to be fun, casual and family oriented day <br/>
&gt; celebrating Leap Year Letterboxing!<br/>
