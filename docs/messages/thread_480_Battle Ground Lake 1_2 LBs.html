Ground Lake in WA. Found Der Mad Stamper's Marshall Lookout with no <br/>
problems and it is in good condition. Tried to find Battle Ground <br/>
Lake #2 but the box seems to be missing judging by the amount of beer <br/>
cans and fishing garbage in the area. Does this box belong to anyone? <br/>
Maybe I didn't look behind the right rock? Please email me off line <br/>
and let me know which rock. There are so many in the area. Would love <br/>
to find this one also.<br/>
