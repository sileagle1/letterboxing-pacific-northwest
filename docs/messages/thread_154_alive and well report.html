<br>
We stopped and picked up the "Spruce Goose" - clever and well done <br>
stamp and what a sweet park, we really enjoyed this park!   Some of <br>
the fountains are not on but still delightful!,  Your box was totally <br>
exposed - I believe since February, the last visitors were newbies.  <br>
We made sure it was well hidden when we left.<br>
<br>
We fished out and almost droped the sunfish thru the planks of a <br>
nearby bridge at Under the Deep Blue #3!  Very nice location what a <br>
beautiful place!  Very nice stamp too.<br>
<br>
And finally got the Chief and Indian Feather, I was sweating that <br>
one.  Wonderful only begins to describe the craftmanship and detail!<br>
<br>
Thank you all for making our outing even more wonderful and opening <br>
up so many more wonderful places we would otherwise neglect to visit!<br>
