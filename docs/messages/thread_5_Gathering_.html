<br>
I don't know of any, but that event in Lakewood was pretty much <br>
single-handedly organized and put together by Bethany, and there's no <br>
reason someone (such as yourself?) can't do the same for Portland!  <br>
If someone (yourself?) is inclined to organize a gathering, I'd like <br>
to vote for October or November, though, since that's likely the <br>
earliest I'd be able to make it.  Most of my spring and summer is <br>
already booked up.<br>

zillion CT boxes!  =)<br>

Actually, I think they're only up to 9 billion, with a B.  By next <br>

Sir Ryan, <br>
  We applaud your speed and dilligence in creating our new regional domain, but we are wondering if you might have a bit too much time on your hands?  We think it would be nice if the colors change with the seasons.  <br>
Will you be carrying a laptop on the App. Trail with you?  We thought maybe that is why you don't carry whole chickens for dinner.  <br>
By the way do you hike/backpack with a walking stick? <br>

A humble suggestion to the Overlord of the PNW Board:  as Supreme <br>
Dictator you should decree that any member of this board who mentions <br>
the unspeakable east coast former English colony in any message <br>
posted here, they should be banned and required to solve a Mapsurfer <br>
Mystery and submit answers to His Dominance to prove his/her <br>
worthiness before being allowed to post again.<br>
<br>
It may sound rather harsh but we do we really want to let that kind <br>
of flippant remark be allowed in your regime?<br>

Well, duh....  ;o)<br>
<br>
> Will you be carrying a laptop on the App. Trail with you?<br>
<br>
No, no laptops, but I did pick up a nifty little device for checking <br>
e-mail from such things as pay phones whenever I pass by them.  It's <br>
pretty fun to play with so far.  But nothing to get Internet access <br>
while on the trail--or even passing through trail town.  Unless <br>
there's a public library with such access in the trail town I pass <br>
by.  I did hear of a guy that DID bring a laptop computer once upon a <br>
time.  I can only imagine how that much have looked, though!<br>
<br>
> By the way do you hike/backpack with a walking stick? <br>
<br>
Depends on the trail's length and steepness.  The steeper and longer <br>
the trail is, the more likely I'm going to have a walking stick with <br>
me.  I'll probably take trekking poles when I start the AT, and if I <br>
find they get in the way, I'll send them home at the first trail town <br>
I reach.<br>
