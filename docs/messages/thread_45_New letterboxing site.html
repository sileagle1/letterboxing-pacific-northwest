<br/>
I want to apologize for the present and future slowness in my posting of<br/>
letterboxes in OR, WA, and ID.  I am in the middle of transitioning our<br/>
letterboxing website from the<br/>
'webmaster-cuts-and-pastes-every-clue-into-a-new-webpage' type to the<br/>
'user-can-enter-their-own-clues' type.  Less administrative work for<br/>
webmasters and easier for letterboxers to modify their clues themselves<br/>
instead of going through a middleman.<br/>
<br/>
Since we're just about to release this to everyone, I will be spending a lot<br/>
of my free time getting it finished up and loaded.  Therefore, I will not be<br/>
as prompt at posting new boxes to the old website.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to let you know about this, and hopefully you'll understand.  If<br/>
you have serious issues, or a box that HAS to be posted right away because<br/>
your great-aunt want to be able to see it ON the internet, I'm sure we can<br/>
work something out.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Wes, the de-lurker.<br/>
