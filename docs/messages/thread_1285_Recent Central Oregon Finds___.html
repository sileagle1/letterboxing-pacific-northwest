<br>
Spent a day and a half with my hubbyman in Central Oregon and grabbed <br>
the opportunity to hunt a few letterboxes!!<br>
<br>
Chimney Rock:  Wonderful hike and find, Funhog!!  Camped at the <br>
nearby campground and scooted up first thing in the morning and found <br>
your box and was stamping by 7:10 a.m.!!!  Have to let you know, <br>
though, your "scattered pile of dead wood" has been replaced by <br>
a "once burned campfire spot" (sniff, sniff).  Alas, no more pile of <br>
scattered dead wood.  Saw two deer on the way back down and was <br>
energized for a great day!  <br>
<br>
John Day Fossil Beds NB Series:  Hey Ryan!!  Wanted to make all three <br>
hunts, but couldn't make the Blue Basin one.  Will definitely go <br>
back, though!!  <br>
<br>
Went to the Painted Hills and came up empty-handed on that one.  <br>
There were 3 trails to choose from.  I chose the one that would give <br>
me the "bird's-eye-view" (Carroll Rim), but when I got to the top and <br>
found the bench, your compass readings weren't adding up.  No parking <br>
lot at 195 degrees, only vast desolation of land.  Made the best of <br>
what I could and spied a couple of possible spots for the box, but no <br>
prize. <br>
<br>
Finally made it to the Clarno Unit and really marveled at the <br>
Palisades!!  Found your box at 6:45 p.m. under partly cloudy and calm <br>
skies.  The view was great with the setting sun shining through the <br>
light and dark clouds.  Still wanted to make one more box before <br>
heading home, so off we went!!!<br>
<br>
Made it to the "45th Parallel at 97057" just as it was getting dark.  <br>
Stamped the book at 7:45 p.m., zipped up my coat against the early <br>
spring chill and took a stroll of the immediate area!!  Lovely.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the fun, kids!!!  Until the next time. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Nobody EVER visits my John Day boxes!!!  =)  As far as I know, <br>
Funhog's the only person to have ever gotten any of them, and that <br>
was YEARS ago!  Lonely little logbooks out there....  Hope you <br>
forgive my carvings--they were some of the first I did, and even <br>
then I carved them all on-site.  I really can do a better job!<br>

<br>
You know, looking back at my clue, I think I might see the problem.  <br>
The degree readings weren't meant to be taken from the top.  I <br>
wanted to hide my letterbox at the top, but couldn't find an <br>
acceptable place for it.  So I started hiking back down the trail <br>
and took the readings from where I actually hid the box.  I don't <br>
think I made that very clear in the clue, though.  The parking lot, <br>
hill, etc. are all in view at the top, but the compass degrees would <br>
be off.  You're supposed to find the point on the trail, however, <br>
where they all add up correctly.  In any case, as the clue states, <br>
the box is possibily missing.  (I think Funhog tried looking for it <br>
twice and came up with nothing, but she made the same mistake you <br>
did the first time up and looked for the box near the top.  I think <br>
she had the right place the second time around, though.)<br>
<br>
Thanks for the updates!<br>
