help to read some of the nice and silly posts .  Needed a giggle.<br/>

Choice of name for Amanda; Head Fly Girl ( with honorable reference <br/>
to the lovely ladies of "In Living Color")  Hang Glider as I do not <br/>
know you I will save comment.  I do however want to , some day, make <br/>
a return to my favorite park in your area Riverside SP.  Though now <br/>
that I look at it their is a certain aeronautic theme here.<br/>
<br/>
Carving personal stamps.  My first effort was my signature stamp <br/>
carved from "the pink stuff" that came in a kit I got at Michaels.  <br/>
It held up well for those first 100 stamps.  Personally I think it <br/>
turned out pretty OK.  Wont comment on some of my other efforts.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly use the trace and transfer technique.  Using tracing paper <br/>
trace the image you want.  The lettering too, don't forget this.<br/>
<br/>
Flip the paper over place on carving medium.  Rub with fingernail or <br/>
a coin.<br/>
<br/>
Carefully peel off.  The image should now be ready to carve.  <br/>
Remember the letters are mirror image so when you stamp the will be <br/>
right way.  I back some stamps with a bit of thin plywood from the <br/>
craft store.  <br/>
<br/>
I have used master carve ( too soft for my taste) and now use PZ <br/>
Kut.  I like how PZ Kut holds the blade well but allows sharp <br/>
detained turns when carving.  Holds enough to avoid stupid <br/>
heartbreaking OOOOps type mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Google is a great source for images.  Type in a topic and have fun.<br/>
<br/>
No one pulled an April Fools on me, though I spent the majority of my <br/>
day with mice, and they are just to polite ( except the one that bit <br/>
my finger deep with a beastly little head twist and flip at the end. <br/>
man did I refresh my French Vocab on that one) Lil darlin.<br/>

Hoping the rest of the week sort of slides on by.<br/>
