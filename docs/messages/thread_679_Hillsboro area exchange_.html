Sunday, Sept 7 to visit family (and to search for some boxes of <br/>
course!)  We intend to locate the Noble Woods boxes, Rood Bridge <br/>
Park, and Jackson Bottom sometime between 11am and 4pm.  Not sure <br/>
how many parks we will be able to hit due to family appointment and <br/>
travel time but we would love to meet up and exchange with anyone <br/>
who would like to.  You know, we are the 7nails and you could score <br/>
a quick 7 X's in one hit.  Email us off list at 7nails @ truthmail . <br/>
com and we can coordinate a meet if anyone is interested.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the trails!<br/>

Nailhead of the Nail Family.<br/>
