Hi :o) Unfortunately my digital camera died in San Francisco :o( so I <br/>
am unable to post a photo. I am not too good at giving directions so <br/>
here is my pre-school version, Picture an elephants head. with big <br/>
ears. The ears are the pencil pouches and the head would be the piece <br/>
of wood. I used an 8'X8' square and drilled 2 holes in each side of <br/>
it to line up with the holes in the pouches, however you may want to <br/>
cut out a rectangle of wood that would be large enough to line all <br/>
all 3 holes (I used strong ribbon knotted sever times to attach). <br/>
When your all done, you can fold it up like sandwhich, one pouch in <br/>
front, wood in the middle, and the other pouch on the back. :o) Good <br/>
luck, hope this helps. <br/>

Well, now I know my instructional level %^)<br/>
Got it!<br/>
And if you don't mind I will give credit to you in my back yard (LBMA)<br/>
with the description.  Although, we have some engineers over there <br/>
that will be totally confused!  Elephants in a backpack?!?!<br/>
