Went on the trail today and found the right place (I'm certain of this) for the Marquam Trail Lb, but it was no where to be seen. Judging by the date of its placement I wonder if it's not been removed, lost or stolen? Has Der Mad Stamper or anyone seen it lately?<br/>

I'll be up there again this week and will try again on both; but I have to say, I went though a lot of brush and bark to not find the Marquam trail Lb. If you have an extra hint I'd appreciate a little assist.<br/>

Thanks! Those branches hurt when against your bare skin! LOL! <br/>

<br/>
Council Crest is one of those spots where a bunch of people hang out, <br/>
drink, climb trees, etc. and the box, according to the clues, was too <br/>
much part of the public area not to have been found by non-boxers.<br/>
<br/>
This was the the first one that my husband &amp; I tried for -- we walked <br/>
up and over Council Crest from Hillsdale to downtown, and checked for <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe someone was trying to hide a stash and found lb and <br/>
tossed or kept it.  My husband said that would be a baaad place for a <br/>
stash, since a website had directions to it!<br/>
<br/>
However, yesterday, my husband &amp; I found our first box!  I'm still <br/>
flying high!  Just joined this group today -- thanks Funhog!<br/>
<br/>
We found the Japanese Garden one.  (I recognized Funhog on this list <br/>
from the LB Notebook there!) Afterwards, we relaxed IN Japanese <br/>
Garden (I'm a member), then had gourmet pizza at Vista Ridge Caf<br/>
to celebrate!<br/>
