pulls over. Then the window comes down and the occupants start asking if I'm <br/>
Funhog? It was the Lennens3 and the Fleshman clan on the prowl for letterboxes at <br/>
Crooked River Ranch. WooHoo! we even got to do an official stamp exchange. It's <br/>
almost like Connecticut out there in the sagebrush. You can't even take a little walk <br/>
without running into other letterboxers. Funhog<br/>

We had a wonderful time!!  Besides the great boxes and great hides, <br/>
we also saw some wonderful wildlife!!!!!  Deer, Bison, Reindeer<br/>
(hehehe), Coyotes, and.....while walking back from the Quail Ale box <br/>
at Eagle Crest, we see 4 count them 4, Otters in the river.  What a <br/>
sight.  We have never seen otters in the wild. It was <br/>
incredible!!!!  My brother also took me for my first time doing some <br/>
4 wheeling in the dirt and mud, it was fun but that was enough for <br/>
me!!!  All in all we found every box we looked for, however, on the <br/>
way home my family stopped to get Waterfowl Highway, and were <br/>
disappointed at a no find.  I know it is there, but it was getting <br/>
late around dusk, and we started to hear rustle in the bushes and <br/>
got a bit scared!!!!<br/>
I did rustle up a family of Quail however!!  What a weekend!!!!<br/>
   Thank you for the wonderful weekend to the Fleshmans and to <br/>
Funhog, it was a real treat!!!!!<br/>
    Just a bit of advice, Everyone needs to plan a trip to Central <br/>
Oregon soon, There is a great new stamp carver who lives there and <br/>
he is planting great boxes!!!!!! These are stamps that you will <br/>
treasure in your journals, they are beautiful!!!!! ( ok yes I am <br/>
just a proud sister of a wonderful artist, and no I am not trying to <br/>
score points here, just proud that is all!!!)  <br/>
     Well I am late for work now, I overslept this morning from <br/>
having so much fun!!!!!<br/>
      Be on the lookout for some new clues soon, the joint effort <br/>
box is a cool one!!!!!!<br/>
Talk soon<br/>

A BIG thank you to FUNHOG for bringing us to some great locations. It was great to finallly <br/>
meet you. If you are at all interested in seeing the otters go at almost dusk. We saw them at <br/>
about 5:30 -6:00. We saw the coyote on our way home from CRR1 also in the evening.<br/>
Later,<br/>
