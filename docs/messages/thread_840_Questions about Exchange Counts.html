<br/>
I had a question on how people do and count exchanges.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally have a moral issue doing an exchange for someone that I <br/>
don't get something in return for.  For example, stamping into an <br/>
Absentee book at a gathering.  I actually won't do it and some people <br/>
get a little bent about it.  I also tend to not do an exchange unless <br/>
the person has a stamp to do an exchange with as well Just seems to <br/>
me that is what and exchange counts as.<br/>
<br/>
But my question comes in when you have changed your signature stamp.  <br/>
I just changed mine here recently for example.  So do people get to <br/>
count my new image as a second exchange if they already had my <br/>
signature stamp before?  If so do they also have to give me a second <br/>
exchange in return?  Or does my signature stamp only count once no <br/>
matter how many times I change it?<br/>
<br/>
Interested in hearing how others handle this sort of situation.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>

I refuse to count exchanges.  It's just too controversial.  I don't <br/>
even have an estimate for exchanges like I do with Fs and Ps.  I'll <br/>
exchange and enjoy it, but trying to count exchanges is like catching <br/>
water with your hands.  Not worth the effort.<br/>

It doesn't matter, but some people have fun counting them.  *shrug*  <br/>
I can't imagine why anyone would want to collect Nancy Drew books <br/>
either, but I know there are people out there that do so.  ;o)<br/>

i count, in my head, found vs. hunted for -- so i can see how well i'm doing in actually finding these things -- but that's a completely different thing :).<br/>

OK I am going to risk a comment and hope I don't get yelled at by <br/>
anyone. What does it even matter what your count is? I don't even <br/>
know what my official F or P count is. I just hunt for fun :) <br/>
