weekend, would like to know of any boxes only minutes off I-5 that I<br/>
might get for a quick fix and a break in the drive.  Searched the data<br/>
base for clues containing "rest area" in Oregon but didn't find any<br/>
there.  Erfellie in southern oregon has told me about Ryan's at the<br/>
Applegate Trail area, but that is really at the campground, and also a<br/>
couple she placed that are not far off I-5, so I know about hers. <br/>
Looking for some others between Portland and Ashland as I progress<br/>
south.  If you give me names of the boxes I can do the research for<br/>
clues myself.  Ryan?  Sounds like you like to frequent rest stops -<br/>
have you any besides Applegate I should stop for?<br/>
