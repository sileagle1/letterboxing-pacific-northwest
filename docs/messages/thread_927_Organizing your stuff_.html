I am lucky to work at home and have a small studio in the house.  It has<br>
built in cabinets and a handy sink along one wall.  I also have a very large<br>
oak drawing board that I bartered for on one of my first paying art jobs lo<br>
so many years ago.  Most of my art/computer equipment is stuffed, stacked<br>
and jammed in this room.  I also have built in storage in the garage.  What<br>
can live out there, does.  If it gets too neat, I freak out.  I thrive in<br>
clutter.  There are all sorts of little plastic containers, airbrush<br>
equipment and rolls of sign vinyl that come tumbling out every time I open<br>
the cupboard under the sink.<br>
<br>
Most of the rest I try to keep in my backpack.  Since it flies with me on<br>
the too numerous business trips, I can't always take my carving stuff, but<br>
the signature stamp, an ink pad and my letterbox log goes on each and every<br>
trip.  Clues are downloaded and printed as needed.<br>
