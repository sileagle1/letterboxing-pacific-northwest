*laughing!!!*  Oh, that's funny.  It's times like those I wish I <br>
worked there and could have watched you 'casing' the joint.  ;o)  So <br>
what did you tell the poor fellow you were freaking out?  =)<br>

My friend told him we were on a scavenger hunt.  That settled him right <br>
down--which, if you ask me, just goes to show you that he was not taking this <br>

COULD be terrorists...)<br>
