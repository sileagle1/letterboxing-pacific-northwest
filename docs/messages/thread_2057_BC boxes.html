apology accepted! :)<br/>
<br/>
as I said, we did have tons of fun trying, but the kiddos were<br/>
starting to get a little disappointed with so many unsuccesful attempts.<br/>
We loved did succeed with the Abbey series, first one.<br/>
So they are happy confident boxers again,<br/>
they just know to watch out for stinging nettle ;)<br/>
<br/>
These boxes should be removed from the database. So sorry that you<br/>
were asked to watch over boxes that were actually removed.<br/>
Sounds like also Houston Trail series #2 was removed. And in fact if<br/>
series #2was removed, I wonder about the original Houston Trail series.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else care to elaborate if they have personal knowledge of these<br/>
boxes.<br/>
Would hate to have others spend great amounts of time searching for<br/>
these, if they have all been removed.<br/>
