<br>
Sue & I will be in your lovely state for the second time in 3 years<br>
for the Live and Breathe gathering. We can hardly wait! Thanks to<br>
Mitch and his whole committee for organizing and working so hard on<br>
this event.<br>
<br>
After the gather, we're heading west to the coast for 6 nights in<br>
Newport (September 14 - September 19.) If there are any letterboxers<br>
close to that area, we would like to set up an evening at a local<br>
eatery to enjoy a meal together, meet and exchange.<br>
<br>
Looking for suggestions as to a meeting place in the vicinity of<br>
Newport - say the Thursday night of that week - September 18?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Mark<br>

with you while you are on the coast.  I am in Florence, just 50 miles<br>
south of Newport.  Since I will also be at Live & Breathe I hope plans<br>
can be discussed then.<br>

My name is Stephanie from Bend, OR (aka Evenstarr1). My family has become very involved in letterboxing over the past few months. Unfortunately, we can not make the gathering to meet all you wonderful people. However, we will be at the Oregon coast starting this upcoming Monday. I am placing a new series of 5 letterboxes called "Pirate's Plunder" along the coastline. If anyone gets the chance to take a peek at them while on your vacations, please give me feedback.<br>
I hope each of you have a wonderful time at the gathering and I hope to meet you all soon!<br>
Steph :)<br>

July 27. I was really hoping to meet you there. <br>

I know you'll have a ball at the coast. Since I don't get to the coast<br>
very often, look forward to finding some of your boxes in Central OR<br>
one day soon. Funhog<br>

What are the details for the Suttle Lake one? I couldn't find any information on that when I was looking on the LbPNW. I would love to meet you, too! My girls think you are just the letterboxing cat's meow! LOL<br>
Also, I was meaning to tell you how impressed I was to see that you put a box in Taos, NM. That is actually my Native tribe. It has been many years since I have been there, but I still have many relatives that live on the reservation. <br>
Have a great week and hope to talk to you soon,<br>
Steph :)<br>
PS  We are going after the box we couldn't find at Tumalo this weekend. I will let you know if we are successful this time. <br>
