I do agree that the even stamp is wonderful  This event stamp along <br/>
with a some special Letterbox stamps in my book; are ones that I am <br/>
very proud to have in there!  Thank you to Brett.  I would have to <br/>
agree with Amanda though, that the event stamp for the roadhouse <br/>
should be retired.  You should only have it if you attend the event.<br/>
Just my 2 cents.  I am ready for the next event already!!!!!<br/>

I agree and it is also the opinion of Esteemed Letterboxing Guru Randy<br/>
Hall as stated in his new book The Letterboxing Companion. If we ever<br/>
get ARose's wonderful Traveling Event Stamp book back in town perhaps<br/>
Brett could enter it there as well. Funhog<br/>
