Tacoma area--both letterboxes are back in business.  Finally got the <br>
wandering soul of a stamp put back in its proper place after work <br>
this afternoon.  It's quite odd that almost a dozen non-letterboxing <br>
folks had found the second stamp in the series...   Can't imagine <br>
folks just study arborvitae all day for fun???  None of 'em had <br>
stamps, either...<br>
<br>
Enjoy your glimpse into an historic little block of Tacoma.  On a <br>
clear day, you'll get a great view of Mt Rainier, too!<br>
