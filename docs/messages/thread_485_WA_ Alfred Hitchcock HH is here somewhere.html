Everyone!<br/>
I have recieved information that Alfred Hitchcock Hitchhiker is <br/>
somewhere in the Seattle area. I guess people don't understand what <br/>
MAIL HIM TO ME! means!!! Was I not clear?? The folks who left him in <br/>
Seattle did not even tell me what box he was left in...<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had time to run out and check on all the local boxes, but I <br/>
am leaving for Connecticut and won't be back for a week or more. If <br/>
anyone comes across Alfred Hitchcock Hitchhiker during your travels <br/>
around Seattle PLEASE DO NOT HIDE HIM IN ANOTHER BOX!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take him home with you and THEN contact me!! I will be happy to come <br/>
pick him up if you do not want to mail him. If you mail him to me, I <br/>
will reimburse you for any expenses!! It will not cost you anything!! <br/>
PLEASE let Alfred come home to me! <br/>
 Thank You!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Amanda from Seattle<br/>
