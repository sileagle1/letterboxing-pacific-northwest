It sounds like :<br>
<br>
You can click enter the boxes you have found and have you own private <br>
checklist, just like in birdwatching.  I believe you will be able to <br>
view all the current boxes and see at a glance which ones you "got" <br>
and which ones you "need"<br>
<br>
  This bird watcher rates this " Two Wings Up!"<br>
<br>
There will be a system of Green Yellow and Red.  Green for go status, <br>
yellow to show possible boxes in trouble ( based on a few trouble <br>
reports by seekers?) and Red which can only be activated by the box <br>
owner to show a down or missing box.<br>
  <br>
I looked at the new system on national and the one problem is the <br>
lack of flexibility.  If I wanted to review a box I plan to visit, I <br>
have to hope that the original poster has entered the name of the box <br>
correctly.  If in fact it has a name, which some of mine do not.  If <br>
there is multiple boxes at a venue you would hope the whole venue is <br>
on one report rather than seeking back and forth on the pages.<br>
<br>
The new national link is a start, but I think this new local program <br>
sounds like a real winner.<br>
<br>
I hope I have not jumped the gun on discussing this but it sounds <br>
like a very welcome tool.  I admire anyone who can carry this off.  I <br>
am a self taught hunt and peck type of computer person and would not <br>
know the first step to making something like this happen.<br>

Yes, there is something in the works... And no Hoopoe, you didn't let the cat out of the bag....  Thanks for your words of kindness and your thought about the website.<br>
<br>
To everyone else, let me share my vision with you as I did with Hoopoe at the gathering.<br>
<br>
Given the databases at the Yahoo site and the main letterboxing site, I, being a webmaster/database admin/programmer felt that there was some additions/enhancements that could be added.  Since the main letterboxing site covers the entire United States, I thought that perhaps I would start with the Pacific Northwest and see where this goes.. Hoopoe if very accurate in her descriptions of what would be there.<br>
<br>
My dream is to provide a site where owners AND others can keep each other informed of the status of a box.  Where the entry of data is painless (Or as painless as I can make it) where updates and conversations can happen at Internet Speed, not snail mail speed. A place where Hitchhikers can be tracked, where updates happen with regularity and where we can all join together in the pursuit of that which consumes us, (Ok maybe only consumes me, but I have an addictive personality).<br>
<br>
If you are interested, come and join us at http://www.myndworx.com<br>
<br>
Go ahead and register, your info will NEVER be given out to anyone for any advertising lists, nor will you be spammed by the site.  With you joining now, you'll see it grow and change daily if not hourly. (grin)  And you'll have an input on what's there and how it works.<br>
<br>
We look forward to seeing you there!!!<br>
