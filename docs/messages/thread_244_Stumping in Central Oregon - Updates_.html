                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We spent the weekend in the Bend/ Mt. Bachelor area last weekend. <br/>
<br/>
We hit a big F49!   6 of 7 that we tried for in Central Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
The 7Nails left 3 wonderful boxes in great locations in the Lava Lands Parks.  We had no trouble finding any of them.  We highly recommend the hunt for all 3.<br/>
<br/>
1. Benham Falls,  was fun to find and educational in the process!  Only Funhog had logged in ahead of us. <br/>
<br/>
2. The  Lava Lands Letterbox,  is very well located, we sat at the viewpoint to log in and got some interesting looks from other visitors, but  to all eyes it just looked like we were updating a journal/diary.  Again only Funghog had been there last September.<br/>
<br/>
3.  We were the 1st to log in at the Lava River Caves box!!!!  Our 1st 1st!!<br/>
Awesome location for a box!   And what a beautifully carved stamp!  Well worth the entry fee to get this one!!!!<br/>
<br/>
7Nails thank you for making these touristy places even more fun!<br/>
<br/>
We also went after Funhog's YaYa Girls' boxes!   There are 4 in the series.<br/>
<br/>
 1.  We found the Camp Sherman box first.  Well done, we had the dog with us so the rodent population kept their distance especially since Tara has this thing with little critters, what dog doesn't.  Take peanuts or little critter snacks with you on this walk and enjoy!  We were only the 2nd boxers to stamp in.  <br/>
<br/>
2.  We then hunted for the Night and Day box, but alas, we are pretty sure we had the right spot, ALL the clues matched up but the rotting tree stump was very crumbled and there was no box in the area, we looked under, in, behind, and  around.  Funhog I'll send you a seperate email of the location and maybe we can verify that we just missed it somehow, if not then it is missing.<br/>
<br/>
3. Then we headed for the Black Butte letterbox, - THANK YOU - what a great place - next time we come back to the area we will seek a camp site here!  We watched a couple shooting the rapids on the Metolius River  here then headed to the last box.  There were some does in the forest that made this drive picture perfect.    Hey Funhog your 1st stampers logged in the day before you placed it, what's up with that! We were only the 2nd visitors to the box. <br/>
<br/>
4.  We went down to the bridge near the Metolius River letterbox just in time to watch that same couple coming down the river and duck under the bridge! They didn't have any clearance, so we went to the other side to besure they both came out the other side with heads still attached. The river is quite beautiful here especially with the afternoon sun hitting it.  Funhog let your head swell on this one especially!!!!   This stamp is really awesome and required several daubers to "paint" it into our log.<br/>
 Your 1st stampers again logged in the day before your placement date!  And again we were only the 2nd visitors to this box. <br/>
<br/>
What a great Memorial Day weekend; camping at Hosmer Lake, canoeing, snowball fighting, siteseeing, brousing shops in Sisters, and letterboxing.  It just doesn't get much better than that!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you 7Nails, Funhog and the YaYA Girls!<br/>

We 7 Nails especially liked designing, carving and placing the <br/>

the park officially closed and asked the ranger if it would still be <br/>
ok to go in.  She reluctantly said ok but that we were on our own <br/>
and if we got into any kind of trouble (misadventures of <br/>
stumbling and breaking limbs and such) they could not send any <br/>
help.  This made the adventure even more exciting!  <br/>
We made a point of stopping mid way in the cave, turning out the <br/>

seek a camp site here!  We watched a couple shooting the <br/>
rapids on the Metolius River  here then headed to the last box.  <br/>

letterbox just in time to watch that same couple coming down the <br/>
river and duck under the bridge! They didn't have any clearance, <br/>
so we went to the other side to besure they both came out the <br/>
other side with heads still attached. The river is quite beautiful <br/>

&gt; Hey, we just came across this message while browsing the <br/>
&gt; archives!  Thanks for visiting our boxes!  <br/>
&gt; We 7 Nails especially liked designing, carving and placing the <br/>
&gt; Lava River Cave box.  It was really spooky.  <br/>

It was great fun. The imagery  of someone sitting in total darkness writing in a log!  What would passersby think.  Tee Hee Hee!<br/>

The 7 Nails have taken letterboxing to a new level with their Lava<br/>
River Cave box. This is definitely the most fun you can have in the<br/>
dark... with stamp and ink, that is. Funhog<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It does sound like a personal issue.  And a fun one, at that!  But, of<br/>
&gt; course, she's just talking about a letterbox, I'm sure.<br/>
