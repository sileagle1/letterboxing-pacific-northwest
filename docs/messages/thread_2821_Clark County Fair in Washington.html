August 3-12, stop on by the Camp Fire USA booth on Tuesday, August 7th <br/>
between 1pm-7pm, Thursday, August 9th between 1pm-4pm, or Friday, <br/>
August 10th between 1pm-7pm and ask for Camp Fire Lady. I will have a <br/>
very special stamp just for the fair and we can make an exchange if I <br/>
haven't already exchanged with you. See you at the Fair!<br/>
