letterbox, Mee-Kwa-Mooks Lowtide, scattered in the middle of the  <br/>
trail in the park of the same name.<br/>
<br/>
I have my email address in the letterbox; so he was able to contact  <br/>
me through that. The good news is he recovered everything; so the  <br/>
letterbox and its beautiful hand-carved stamp will live again. He was  <br/>
kind enough to drop it off at my house!!!<br/>
<br/>
This is the second time this letterbox has been vandalized. I will do  <br/>
a better job finding a new hiding spot. I've temporarily marked this  <br/>
letterbox as "retired" until it has a new home.<br/>
<br/>

This same geocacher also found Bethany's Bread Batter Hat Letterbox in<br/>
the same park. It had previously been thought to be missing!! And was<br/>
found underneath a log NOT in a cubby hole of the Maple that is in the<br/>
clue. I will have to get up there to double check, but it is in the<br/>
general area of the 1st Maple on the right after the gully underneath<br/>
a log!<br/>
