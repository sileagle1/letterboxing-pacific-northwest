So I just got back from a wonderful 3 day trip to downtown Portland, <br/>
which I have never been too, just the outskirts. (The traffic scares <br/>
me)its just too easy to get lost in such a big city. But Anyways...I <br/>
was a bit anxious during my trip because I was with a small group of <br/>
friends who wanted to vacation for a few days and go to a concert, <br/>
OMSI, night clubs, dinners, all of it was great fun, however I <br/>
couldnt help but wonder at every street corner, "Is there a letterbox <br/>
here?" and I went in several book stores knowing 2 of them held <br/>
letterboxes but alas found none. I was accompanied by wonderful <br/>
friends who have absolutely no interest in letterboxing and and for <br/>
the life of them cant understand why I am so enthusiastic about it. <br/>
Well Since Sandi and I have acquired evry single letterbox in our <br/>
area we now must travel farther for the hunt. Well, unfortunately no <br/>
one was interested in finding letterboxes and since I knew that was <br/>
how it was going to be I didnt even bother with bringing any clues <br/>
but it was a fun expereience nonetheless and educational. In that <br/>
huge city, I now know I can take exit 306B and find "The Max" and it <br/>
will take me to alot of places for only $3.50 (Unless you lose your <br/>
ticket like my drunk friend did haha) So... After I finish unpacking <br/>
tonight, I might just have to plan another trip to portland. Oh, and <br/>
anyone that hasnt seen in Omnimax movie at OMSI, DO IT! <br/>

Dang! You could've ridden that Max train up to the Zoo and found a bunch of boxes <br/>
there and in the surrounding arboretum... Next time you brave the big city, put out a <br/>
call on the Talk List and I'm sure you will get lots of recommendations for boxes <br/>
accessible using public transportation. Plus, you might get to meet up with some of <br/>
us city folk who share your addiction. Funhog<br/>

Hi! Actually just 2 weeks ago I did make a trip up to Portland in <br/>
search of the Oregon Zoo LB's and found them but we spent so much <br/>
time enjoying the zoo we were left with very little daylight and went <br/>
in search of the arboretum boxes but lost daylight and had to return. <br/>
I knew I wouldnt have the chance to meet up with any other Portland <br/>
LB'ers so I didnt bother listing it on the website. The crowd I was <br/>
with just wouldnt want to do that, but I will certainly make another <br/>
trip up there. Thanks for the suggestion though of using the public <br/>
transportation, I will be sure to ask people on the talk list about <br/>
surrounding LB's before I go up there again. It seems few people <br/>
plant LB's in southern Oregon :o( And now that its winter I might <br/>
have to wait until spring for a new one. Well, thats life! I can't <br/>
have everything my way, just most of it hehe :o)<br/>
