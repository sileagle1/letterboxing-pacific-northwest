Uh, I was kidding. I thought my "hmm.. have to work the bug's out" <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is currently only one Chuck's Tacklebox box left that is still <br/>
only boat accessable. 2 more remain at the public boat launches, 2 <br/>
have recently been pulled in prep for placing with the other 7 at <br/>
Millers Syl vania.  <br/>
<br/>
There is one other I know of that is a 'floater'.  It was placed by <br/>
Sunseeker at Silver Lake near Castlerock.  I have not been to it yet <br/>
but it also requires a boat to reach it.  It was placed well over a <br/>
year ago and I doubt that anyone has found it yet, unless some <br/>
curious fisherman looked in a certain stump.....<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I do also recall something on the main list about a year ago <br/>
describing an underwater box placed in a stream or lake.  It was in a <br/>
waterproof container and weighted so it would sink.  I believe it was <br/>
tethered to a tree, log, or dock perhaps.  I have been toying with <br/>
that kind of idea for some time.  However, underwhelming response to <br/>
the Chuck's Tacklebox series has led me to believe that unless a box <br/>
is placed in a kayaking area, no one will venture to seek them out.<br/>
Just my experience.<br/>

Amazed that it survived, but then perhaps the dynamics of the <br/>
