Are you implying that there's something bicoastal going on between the<br/>
Funhog and the Sleight of Hand?  Wouldn't we ALL love to know.  <br/>

Yeah, right. We all know that Funhog and Legerdemaine are really the <br/>
same person. Has anyone actually seen them at the same time? :)<br/>

Crooked River Ranch #1.  Like all the 'Hog's boxes, it's located in a <br/>
purty, out of the way spot that you'd never find were it not for her <br/>
leading you there.  Like so many carvers, the silly thing's <br/>
embarrassed about her first effort, which is rather crude compared <br/>
with her current work.  I'd have to call it my favorite find of the <br/>
trip, and I found some good boxes out there.  History is the creation <br/>
of anecdotes and artifacts, and it was a thrill to have the 'Hog's <br/>
first effort in my hand.  Consider the path that she, and all of us, <br/>
have been on since that first bit of innocent dabbling...<br/>
