www.letterboxing.org catalogue so that they can be easily found.<br>
<br>
My reasoning for posting the clue separately is related mostly to<br>
formatting-I want to be able to mention details that aren't technically a<br>
clue, like "this box is good for youngsters," or a bit of history on the<br>
box.  The main index doesn't allow for this, and while I could just stick<br>
them in with the clue I'm too nitpicky to do so.<br>

The Pacific Northwest Letterboxing site is located at http://www.myndworx.com<br>
<br>
Come take a look while the construction is one, just make sure you wear your hard hats when entering and don't mind the dust or the noise.  The workman will be gone in a little while and everything will be running smoothly.<br>
