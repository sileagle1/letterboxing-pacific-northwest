 <br>
"Chris the Crab" is in need of a dry plastic bag, at the very least.  The log book has been reported as very soggy and molding, but I can take care of that on my next trip.  <br>
 <br>
If anyone out there plans on passing Cape Foulweather, could you please, please, please make a quick stop and provide a clean, dry bag?  Email me ahead of time and I'll tell you where he's hiding to save you time!!<br>
 <br>
Thanks so much!!!  Kokopelli<br>
