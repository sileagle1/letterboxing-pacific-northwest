Stage 3 = that anxiety attack that comes with your first "I think it <br/>
may be missing report"<br/>
<br/>
Stage 4 = that panic that propels you to create a replacement <br/>
letterbox before you leave your home so when you check on it and it <br/>
is indeed missing you'll be all ready to replant it without more <br/>
than a day's gap in 'coverage'--then, you show up to the hiding <br/>
spot, probe for your box and find it there alive &amp; well, whew!  just <br/>
another false missing report.  After this happens a good 3 or 4 <br/>
times, then you start doubting every SINGLE missing report you get.  <br/>
Eventually, you get real prepared for the subsequent follow-up <br/>
email "Please don't hate me but upon reattempting this box armed <br/>
with a compass/brain/explanation of the difference between right &amp; <br/>
left, fir &amp; pine, mushroom and toadstool--I actually found the box, <br/>
alive &amp; well, right where the clues said it should be!!!"  ;)  <br/>
<br/>
Then, you transition to Stage 5...assembling that ever available <br/>
letterbox maintenance/first aid kit for your car and the additional <br/>
mini-kit you carry with you along the trail (complete with extra <br/>
ziploc freezer baggies/jewelry sized ziploc baggies, pens, <br/>
hitchhiker letterbox info label and additional watertight container <br/>
just in case the one you visit is damaged).  This ultimately evolves <br/>
into your 'create a letterbox on a whim' kit for your car--so <br/>
whenever the muse is right and creativity abounds, you quickly <br/>
assemble a letterbox and plant it whereever you are at THAT VERY <br/>
MOMENT--even knowing you're sure to NEVER return to that spot on the <br/>
Earth ever again!!!<br/>
<br/>
Then, Stage 6.5 manifests itself...  ;)<br/>

And I hope I'm not one of the people who report non-missing boxes. (might<br/>
be)  Guess it  takes finding a few boxes from a particular placer to get the<br/>
feel for how they place.<br/>
We put  a lot of effort into searching when we're on a box hunt....<br/>
sometimes the clues just don't add up.  Having 3 heads working on it usually<br/>
cracks it.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolmommy - can't wait to get up there and Lb in Spokane.  Probably<br/>
won't be before the campout in September - but who knows.  Hopefully we can<br/>
place some boxes while we're there to give you something new to find.  ...<br/>
now if I could just figure out how to get a box around one of those<br/>
incredible boulders east of town...hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
