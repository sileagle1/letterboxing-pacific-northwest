Hi there....<br/>
  Last time we were on this board was before our baby was born and he <br/>
is 15 months old and ready to go letterboxing now. A couple of <br/>
weekends we went out to Powell Butte and found those 2. That turned <br/>
into a 3 hour hike for us in the rain and it was a lot of fun and <br/>
well worth it. I was noticing that there is a gathering planned at <br/>
Silver Falls and we would love to learn more about it. This would be <br/>
a first with us. We would love to meet others that enjoy this hobby <br/>
that we love so much.We got to meet a couple of fellow letterboxers <br/>
last summer and enjoyed our time with them. If I understand it is a <br/>
bunch of letterboxers getting together and we newbies learn from the <br/>
experienced carvers, log makers and clue writers. We would love to <br/>
learn more about this hobby from the experienced ones. If its not too <br/>
late we would like more info and hopefully be counted in if it works <br/>
for our schedule. There are 6 of us in our family. Thanks for your <br/>
time and happy hunting.<br/>
