The clues to this box are so hard I don't expect anyone to ever find <br>
it. I'm so sure that I've placed an actual one hundred dollar bill <br>
in the box as a first finders reward. <br>
<br>
You will need internet access mid-search. A useful URL for those <br>
with wireless internet is: http://www.wififreespot.com/ You can find <br>
a couple of free access spots near your search.<br>
<br>
The clues begin with the 100bill.jpg found in the photos section of <br>
the LbPNW Yahoo group at: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW/<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

If you can't figure out where Ben Franklin is, then perhaps you can <br>
find George Washington! He's also in the photo's section of the LbPNW <br>
Yahoo Group  and you won't need wifi to see him. If you figure out <br>
the clue, then email me and I will send you the letterbox stamp <br>
image. Heck, I'll even throw in the dollar!<br>
