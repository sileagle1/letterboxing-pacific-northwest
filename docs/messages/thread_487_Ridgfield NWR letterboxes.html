   Set out yesterday to find the Ridgefield NWR letterboxes and am <br>
happy to report that they are both alive and well. The Carty Box was <br>
a little difficult to find because of the overgrown blackberry <br>
brambles but it was located. It had fallen from it's perch but is <br>
back where it belongs. I noticed that the boxes hadn't been visited <br>
since March 2003. What a shame. On the way to the River S box Cat's <br>
Meow and I and friends came upon a Shwann's Ice Cream truck with a <br>
big sign that read "FREE ICE CREAM" so of course we had to stop <br>
considering it was one of the hottest days of the year in Washington. <br>
101 degrees! Go figure. Hey Team Rayvenhaus, is there a code for <br>
pounds lost in sweat?! maybe PLIS? Anyway, The River S box was a <br>
blessing since we were pretty wiped out after the Carty Box. <br>
Proceeded onto the lookout where we stood in the corner very quietly <br>
and watched the swallows dart in and out to feed their young. There <br>
were three nests full of youngins. If anyone plans on visiting these <br>
boxes soon I would suggest applying a ton of mosquito repellent. I <br>
was pretty lubed up but was still attacked. I walked away with a welt <br>
on my arm the size of a silver dollar! <br>
