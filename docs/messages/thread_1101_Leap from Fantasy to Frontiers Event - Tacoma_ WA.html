a Leap Day Event here in Tacoma if anyone is interested! Here is what <br/>
we have so far!<br/>
<br/>
Day:Sunday, February 29th<br/>
Place: Pt. Defiance Park (Tacoma, WA)<br/>
       Kitchen Shelter at NeverNeverLand/Ft.Nisqually<br/>
Time: 1pm-4pm (Main Event)<br/>
<br/>
The name for this event is geared around Leap Year, NeverNeverLand <br/>
and Ft. Nisqually. We are planning on this being a potluck luncheon. <br/>
Each family/person needs to bring their own plates,utensils, hot/cold <br/>
drinks and a potluck dish to share.<br/>
<br/>
We are aware that this is a Sunday event and that some may have <br/>
church schedules to attend and thus we have proposed the later 1pm <br/>
start time. We figure some people may come early to hunt/place boxes, <br/>
eat then leave or some may come at 1pm eat, box, exchange, chat and <br/>
maybe place a box or two even! Some may come early and stay the whole <br/>
day!! <br/>
<br/>
The kitchen/shelter has running water and a bathroom nearby, plenty <br/>
of parking and a nice starting place for many boxes that could be <br/>
clustered/hidden nearby! I know that I've already staked out about 3 <br/>
different areas I'd like to hide some boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Bring clues to boxes may hide for the event and feel free to carve <br/>
event stamps if you are so inclined. The park has many wonderful <br/>
boxes already hidden in various locations. We figure that the <br/>
Fantasy/Frontier theme may even inspire a few more!!<br/>
<br/>
So..get your carving tools out, boxes placed, clues ready and be <br/>
prepared to join us for a once in every four years day of leap year <br/>
boxing! We want this to be fun, casual and family oriented day <br/>
celebrating Leap Year Letterboxing! <br/>

exhuberance (SP??) in letterboxing. Feel free to chew them up and <br/>
spit them out if they aren't plump enough for you!! LOL...just <br/>
kidding! In fact I'll have an extra neighborhood kid who has already <br/>
carved his first stamp for his first box even though he has never <br/>
letterboxed in his life. He can't wait to go hide it at the park <br/>
sometime this next month. He has vicariously letterboxed via our kids <br/>
stories about it!<br/>
<br/>
As to....your park!! LOL!! I only just heard about your boxes this <br/>
past week. I'm proud to say that I've found two of them and we (my <br/>
neighbor and I) have deciphered all but one plaque..need to go find <br/>
the FEO one! We are hoping to finish off that series of boxes this <br/>
weekend. Although we did find an error in the Rhodedendron plaque <br/>
clues. But I was able to figure it out real quick what the clue was <br/>
supposed to be since I'm a "local gal"! I will say the <br/>
sisters/daughters was a little tougher as I didn't know that one <br/>
existed!! I'm throughly enjoying hunting down your boxes and as <br/>
Bethany said to me some of them are tough but when you finish you <br/>
feel like you've solved the Sunday New York Times Crossword Puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
So..."your park"....will now hopefully be a "letterboxing <br/>
destination" for the rest of us whom you have inspired to add some <br/>
more boxes too!! And I hope to meet the infamous "Evil Glenn" whom I <br/>
suppose is not really so evil as people may think he is! But you do <br/>
have to have an "evil/devious" mind to come up with the clues you do <br/>
come up with!! And I appreciate it's deviousness even more as a <br/>
result! Great boxes with a great hunt for them!<br/>
<br/>
Til later,<br/>
MiniBullyMom<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you will be there for our "event" on Leap Day! <br/>
&gt; In MY PARK!!!!!<br/>

&gt; Bring lots of small children. Plump tasty small children please.<br/>

I can't wait to see what folks come up with.  I'm even more excited <br/>

Thanks for volunteering Steve! So far no takers on the "class" offer <br/>
so unless I hear otherwise can we count on you! Hey..don't worry <br/>
about carving level..the simpler the better when it comes to <br/>
beginning carvers. I will say that the gasket is black so we may need <br/>
to figure out what to use to stand out against it if we want to show <br/>
how to transfer designs. Otherwise it will be great for freehanded <br/>
carving.<br/>

&gt; Hey..Adventure Seeker and myself (MiniBullyMom) are jointly <br/>
planning <br/>
&gt; a Leap Day Event here in Tacoma if anyone is interested! Here is <br/>
what <br/>
&gt; we have so far!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Day:Sunday, February 29th<br/>
&gt; Place: Pt. Defiance Park (Tacoma, WA)<br/>
&gt;        Kitchen Shelter at NeverNeverLand/Ft.Nisqually<br/>
&gt; Time: 1pm-4pm (Main Event)<br/>
&gt;       <br/>
&gt; The name for this event is geared around Leap Year, NeverNeverLand <br/>
&gt; and Ft. Nisqually. We are planning on this being a potluck <br/>
luncheon. <br/>
&gt; Each family/person needs to bring their own plates,utensils, <br/>
hot/cold <br/>
&gt; drinks and a potluck dish to share.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are aware that this is a Sunday event and that some may have <br/>
&gt; church schedules to attend and thus we have proposed the later 1pm <br/>
&gt; start time. We figure some people may come early to hunt/place <br/>
boxes, <br/>
&gt; eat then leave or some may come at 1pm eat, box, exchange, chat <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; maybe place a box or two even! Some may come early and stay the <br/>
whole <br/>
&gt; day!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The kitchen/shelter has running water and a bathroom nearby, <br/>
plenty <br/>
&gt; of parking and a nice starting place for many boxes that could be <br/>
&gt; clustered/hidden nearby! I know that I've already staked out about <br/>
3 <br/>
&gt; different areas I'd like to hide some boxes!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bring clues to boxes may hide for the event and feel free to carve <br/>
&gt; event stamps if you are so inclined. The park has many wonderful <br/>
&gt; boxes already hidden in various locations. We figure that the <br/>
&gt; Fantasy/Frontier theme may even inspire a few more!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So..get your carving tools out, boxes placed, clues ready and be <br/>
&gt; prepared to join us for a once in every four years day of leap <br/>
year <br/>
&gt; boxing! We want this to be fun, casual and family oriented day <br/>
&gt; celebrating Leap Year Letterboxing!<br/>
