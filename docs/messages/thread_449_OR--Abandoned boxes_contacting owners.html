Back in Feb (I think), I contacted Canada Goose re: a vandalized box in the <br>
Mexico/Mom series.  I didn't keep her e-mail address, but you could try sending <br>
a message to her the same way I did: go into the list-serve archives and do a <br>
search (using the word "Goose" or "Mexico," I'd suggest--I don't think the <br>
search recognizes more than one word, and either of those seems likely to snag <br>
an appropriate message).  Look for a message that she sent, and then click to <br>
reply to her.  You won't see her full e-mail address, but can still send her a <br>
message.  Hopefully her address hasn't changed & hopefully you'll get a <br>
response.  It's quite possible that she's still into maintaining her boxes, but just <br>
doesn't realize things have changed on the website.<br>

P.S. I'm all curious now, so maybe you'll send me a message telling me if you <br>
make contact or not...<br>
