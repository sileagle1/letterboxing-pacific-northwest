I apologize for being so late with these and hope they can still reach<br/>
you in time for Christmas. I've been in the hospital for the past two<br/>
days and I'm still a little dazed. Everything is just fine (routine<br/>
gall-bladder removal) but it will take a few days until I'm back to<br/>
normal.<br/>
<br/>
If you have not pre-ordered a shirt, but would like to order one,<br/>
there are a few extras. But please give the pre-orderers a few days to<br/>
pick up their requests first.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much and have a blessed holiday!<br/>
