                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got to sneak away for a couple hours today between work segments <br>
and took a needed walk through Tolmie State Park in North Lacey.  <br>
Checked on the 3 boxes hidden there.  Both of dnv2rckr's boxes are <br>
still in place, contents dry and having had several visitors.  My own <br>
Huckleberry box is doing quite well too.  However, there is some <br>
trail work going on right now and the box was actually exposed to <br>
view from the trail.  Workers have dropped off lumber and concrete <br>
supports to rebuild one of the bridges nearby and a large board was <br>
placed right next to the exposed box.  I rehid it and did my best to <br>
conceal it with some loose bark found nearby. So it is ready for <br>
visitors again and hopefully not the unasked for kind.<br>
<br>
Funny thing, all threeof the log books in the 3 boxes have had <br>
visitors log in on both ends of the log book!?!  I thought that only <br>
Trial n Error did such things but he actually had logged in all 3 <br>
boxes correctly.  Go figure.  Whatever the manner of logging in, the <br>
boxes are all in great shape and ready for more visitors.  I plan to <br>
place a new box out there soon. It is so close to my work that I plan <br>
to use it as a getaway frequently. I would very much like to make a <br>
quality stamp for this new box so it may take me some time to get it <br>
together.  I have already found a very nice hidey hole for it, just <br>
have to get my creative juices flowing and get to carving.  Look for <br>
the clues on this list soon.<br>
<br>
The park is wonderfully peaceful right now with lots of new foliage <br>
coming out, birds everywhere, and lots of evidence of small animals <br>
around.  The park service is doing alot of maintenance and <br>
enhancement of the trails now and the lower parking lot is still <br>
closed due to the earthquake damage but I think that only keeps the <br>
bulk of the crowds away (not to mention the $5/day or $50/yr parking <br>
fee).  All in all the park is lovely and quite void of humans right <br>
now. A dedicated letterboxer can justify the parking fee and the trip <br>
out is well worth it. There are lots of benches placed along the <br>
trail for hikers to take a rest among the woods. Make sure if you <br>
visit to take the time to sit and be quiet for a while and take in <br>
all the sights, sounds, and smells.  It is great for relieving stress.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you on the trails soon,<br>
