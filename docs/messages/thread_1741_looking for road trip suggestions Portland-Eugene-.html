Hi,<br/>
I am flying into the Portland airport and driving down I-5 to Eugene<br/>
and then up 126 East to Mckenzie Bridge/Blue River area.<br/>
I will be a little pressed for time and with DH and two kids. I am<br/>
looking for suggestions of favorite boxes along the way. <br/>
I love hand carved stamps and we leave hand carved impressions as we go.<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>

We left the Quacker Backer box in Eugene and also a new box at Fall Creek <br/>
Res.  Part of our Campin with JR series. We suggest finding boxes placed by <br/>
Kruzcontrol (sp?) they have one up at Cougar Res. Great hand carved <br/>
stamps! We also left one at Sahalie Falls if you want to venture farther east. <br/>
good luck and happy LBing.<br/>

My suggestion would be to do the boxes done by TeamTiredFeet.  Their <br/>
boxes are very nice.<br/>
<br/>
Also Dorris Ranch (Springfield) is a beautiful Filbert park.  And <br/>
there are some letterboxes there.  The girl scout series we placed <br/>
was stolen (working on replacing them) but there are other boxes out <br/>
there worth the trip.  <br/>

My Bluebird Trail box is a just a short distance off I-5, south of Portland. The Portland <br/>
area itself has TONS of good boxes, many of them very short walks. You are unlikely <br/>
to find any store bought stamps in this area. I think I've only found three in all the <br/>
Oregon boxes I've found. Good luck, Funhog<br/>

If you have a half hour or so in Eugene try The Rhododendron Box.  It's<br/>
not far from the UO campus and it is a delightful park.  My son attends<br/>
Oregon and the only time we could carve out to go letterboxing was<br/>
6:00AM Sunday morning, the weekend he moved in.  The clues are well<br/>

Hi! In case you havent made your trip already, in portland there are <br/>
ALOT of boxes in the same area of Oregon Zoo and Hoyt Arbotreum <br/>
(which are side by side) Good place for lots of boxes and little <br/>
hiking, there are 4 alone inside the zoo. There are alos ALOT of <br/>
boxes just north of the Zoo in upper and lower Macleay Park. Hope <br/>
this helps!<br/>
