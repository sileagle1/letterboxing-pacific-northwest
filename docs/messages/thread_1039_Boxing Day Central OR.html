for Birder's Phoebe Pond series and were successful on all but one.<br/>

On Saturday, I set out alone to track down the Fleshman's Tetherow<br/>
Crossing letterbox. I now have yet another of John's charming stamps<br/>
in my collection. As snowflakes drifted down, I left a new letterbox<br/>
to commemorate the historic Tetherow House. I was also lucky enough to<br/>
receive a private invitation to visit a limited edition Christmas 2003<br/>
letterbox while I was in that part of the state. What an honor! <br/>

Here's hoping everyone else had a wonderful Boxing Day. Funhog<br/>

had a great time taking in the fresh breeze and watching Funhog <br/>
teach the kids about different things in nature, we even learned <br/>
things too!!!  Great fun and a great hike!  Great new stamps too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great Christmas, and for the cool Limited Edition box.  <br/>
One of my christmas presents sent me on a letterboxing hunt around <br/>
the house and outdoors (in my jammies!) to find a new box!  It was a <br/>
very pleasant surprise!! Thanks John!<br/>
