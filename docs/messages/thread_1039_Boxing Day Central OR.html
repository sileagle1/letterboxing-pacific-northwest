to be in Central OR and met up with the Lennens 3, the Fleshmans plus<br>
 Mom and Dad to form an intrepid troop of nine letterboxers! We went<br>
for Birder's Phoebe Pond series and were successful on all but one.<br>
We're hoping that our crawling and poking was just in the wrong spot<br>
for the elusive one and the box is still awaiting discovery. Not only<br>
were we rewarded with finding the other letterboxes but scat and<br>
skulls figured prominently in the finds of the day.<br>
<br>
On Saturday, I set out alone to track down the Fleshman's Tetherow<br>
Crossing letterbox. I now have yet another of John's charming stamps<br>
in my collection. As snowflakes drifted down, I left a new letterbox<br>
to commemorate the historic Tetherow House. I was also lucky enough to<br>
receive a private invitation to visit a limited edition Christmas 2003<br>
letterbox while I was in that part of the state. What an honor! <br>
<br>
Here's hoping everyone else had a wonderful Boxing Day. Funhog<br>

had a great time taking in the fresh breeze and watching Funhog <br>
teach the kids about different things in nature, we even learned <br>
things too!!!  Great fun and a great hike!  Great new stamps too!<br>
<br>
Thanks for a great Christmas, and for the cool Limited Edition box.  <br>
One of my christmas presents sent me on a letterboxing hunt around <br>
the house and outdoors (in my jammies!) to find a new box!  It was a <br>
very pleasant surprise!! Thanks John!<br>
