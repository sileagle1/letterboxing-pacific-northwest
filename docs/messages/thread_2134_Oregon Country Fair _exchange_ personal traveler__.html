<br/>
I am headed to the Oregon Country Fair this Friday! If anyone is<br/>
going, here are some "clues" as to where I will be. I will defiantly<br/>
have my stamp and logbook with me! I will see if I have time to carve<br/>
some kind of special personal traveler.<br/>
<br/>
Clues (They are cryptic because I cannot remember the exact details,<br/>
but we will defiantly be there!): On Friday, July 8th, sometime in the<br/>
morning:  I will be wearing a white dress and have a blue backpack. I<br/>
have shorter reddish hair, and I will be with a boy who has a sort of<br/>
Beatles haircut. We will be seeing the first showing of my cousin's<br/>
play. It is mostly for children, but very entertaining. It is playing<br/>
at the stage that is to the right of Chela Mela Meadow. If you are<br/>
entering it from any other part of the fair you will come to the end<br/>
if it and turn right. It should be near the sushi stand. It has the<br/>
word `morning' in it. The name of his acting group is the `Fremont<br/>
Players'. Some version of this must be in the entertainment schedule.<br/>
These are the exact clues a friend of mine got when she asked me where<br/>
we should meet. I left all the important details out only because I<br/>
don't actually know them!<br/>
<br/>
See you there!<br/>
Becca<br/>
<br/>
PS. I had an awesome time at the Silver Falls Gathering. It only made<br/>
letterboxing better for me to see all the great people involved in it.<br/>
You will be seeing a lot more of me in the next couple of months <br/>
