                    <div class="plaintext-content">LadyB, her son Monkeyboy and I found this last summer.<br>
<br>
It was originally in a metal case (similar to a mints case) and it <br>
had been crushed under the huge mounds of rocks at its hiding place.  <br>
Though the logbook was in a bag, the deterioration of the box and the <br>
nearby water had allowed moisture in.  The logbook was not only wet, <br>
it was a gooey mess of filth and mud and who knows what else.<br>
<br>
LadyB and Monkeyboy had a spare box for planting that they ues to <br>
replace the case.  I have a spiral logbook, so we ripped out a few <br>
pages for a temporary logbook and pulled out some spare ziplocks.<br>
<br>
I think LadyB tried to contact the planter about the icky logbook <br>
(beyond redemption) and I don't think she got a response.<br>
<br>
Sounds like this box or the location just are not going to work, <br>
especially with needles nearby! (shudder)<br>
<br>
Thanks for salvaging what you could and letting us know.<br>
<br>
Please let us know if you hear from the placer.<br>
