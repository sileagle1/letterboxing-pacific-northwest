  Has anyone found the letterbox at Fort Vancouver lately?  I was out<br/>
looking for a few weeks ago and had no luck.  Was I just missing it or is it<br/>
missing (maybe not replaced after the 4th of July?)?<br/>

By the way, if your clues reflect the numbers on the trees a lot of them are missing.  I didn't find any trees with the numbers in your clues.  Of course, I could be wrong about what those numbers refer to :)<br/>

Thanks for the update.<br/>
