    I feel your pain.  Even before I could post the clues to the PNWLb site<br/>
or even to the LBNa site, two new boxes we had planted were viciously<br/>
destroyed and left as litter on the trail.  I know how you feel, and all I<br/>
can say is this.....<br/>
<br/>
    I've decided to take what little time they may have on this earth and<br/>
cherish it. If they get lost or stolen or destroyed, I'll simply recarve<br/>
them, knowing that I'm doing a better job this time.  That's one of the<br/>
reason I so enjoy the SitReps so that I know that at least someone also<br/>
found enjoyment in one of my boxes.<br/>
<br/>
    I know it doesn't help, but I just wanted to share my thoughts with you.<br/>
Please don't pull your boxes, they're one of the reason we stuck to this<br/>
hobby at the start.<br/>

&gt; Orca Mystery LB--vandized--missing stamp &amp; logbook!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok--I'm about to give up!  This is pushing a dozen the number of my<br/>
&gt; boxes that have gone missing in just a matter of weeks.  I won't say<br/>
&gt; where this one was but dang it--I'm getting to the point that I will<br/>
&gt; pull all of my boxes.  This is too frustrating. This one had an<br/>
&gt; incredible history in the logbook.  Is it a conspiracy?  Who knows???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If that's what these folks want then that's what they're soon going<br/>
&gt; to get.  Sorry that others don't get to enjoy this hobby anymore...<br/>
&gt; If folks can't be discreet in finding/stamping in/rehiding it, then<br/>
&gt; the hobby has NO FUTURE!!! I'm about to stop investing<br/>
&gt; time/resources in this...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for bearing bad news, but I've just about hit my limit!!!<br/>

Sounds to me like someone has been targeting your boxes, such as they can.<br/>
As if Geocachers or someone else has stumbled across the clues and have<br/>
decided to remove the letterboxes for whatever their reason... Specially<br/>
coupled with these strange emails you've received.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we can only do one thing in a case like this... Outlast them.  When<br/>
they find them, I move them to a different spot.  To get the clues from the<br/>
PNWLb site, you have to be a registered member of the site. The system<br/>
tracks who's been viewing your boxes and will indicate the viewing history<br/>
to you.<br/>
<br/>
That's about the only things I can think of to still get to enjoy my hobby<br/>
and not call it quits.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>

&gt; I understand.  I'm just wondering why most boxes within a 5 mile<br/>
&gt; radius of one particular location are suddenly disappearing--as if<br/>
&gt; in an orchestrated manner???  That's what's driving me insane.  I've<br/>
&gt; had several boxes go missing over the past 14+ months--I understand<br/>
&gt; that and accept it as one of the hazards of the hobby.  It's the<br/>
&gt; letterboxes that have survived over a year and then methodically,<br/>
&gt; over the course of a few weeks, are suddenly disappearing or being<br/>
&gt; vandalized at a rate of about one a day--this, coupled with several<br/>
&gt; bizarre emails I've received lately, is driving me to the point of<br/>
&gt; frustration!  For example:  The ones that aren't hidden in locations<br/>
&gt; where someone would just 'accidentally' fall over them--these are<br/>
&gt; boxes that either somebody, with not so friendly intentions, has the<br/>
&gt; clues to or folks are not seeking discreetly and they're<br/>
&gt; compromosing the hiding spot while visiting the letterbox. I'm not<br/>
&gt; going to pull the boxes per se, I just plan on pulling the clues<br/>
&gt; from the national page--it'll lessen the traffic to the various<br/>
&gt; boxes (so if people really WANT them, they'll have to do some<br/>
&gt; research before they can find them).  I am, however, at the point<br/>
&gt; that when they go missing, they're history!<br/>

I think its time to go underground.  I think that you should assume <br/>
that alias you have been toying with and leave the dn2r to others for <br/>
a while.  You have been so prominent in the last year that you have <br/>
attracted too much attention to yourself.  Time to blend into the <br/>
background and move stealthily.  I would expect that any new boxes <br/>
you place will be mysteries from now on.  <br/>
<br/>
Being exiled didnt stop Evil Glenn, being singled out for sabotage <br/>
shouldnt stop you either.  <br/>

I feel your pain yet I don't want to believe that anyone would be purposely targeting your letterboxes. The best way to get to your enemy is to forgive him and go on with your life or in this case letterboxing. Don't be a sniveling wimp Bethany wipe your nose and go carve a stamp. Sheesh. They didn't eat one of your kids. Get over it. In time the driver in front of you will be far more irritating and if there is a culprit they will still have to deal with the Karma they created.  <br/>
