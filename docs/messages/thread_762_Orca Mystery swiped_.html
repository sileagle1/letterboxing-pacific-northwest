    I feel your pain.  Even before I could post the clues to the PNWLb site<br>
or even to the LBNa site, two new boxes we had planted were viciously<br>
destroyed and left as litter on the trail.  I know how you feel, and all I<br>
can say is this.....<br>
<br>
    I've decided to take what little time they may have on this earth and<br>
cherish it. If they get lost or stolen or destroyed, I'll simply recarve<br>
them, knowing that I'm doing a better job this time.  That's one of the<br>
reason I so enjoy the SitReps so that I know that at least someone also<br>
found enjoyment in one of my boxes.<br>
<br>
    I know it doesn't help, but I just wanted to share my thoughts with you.<br>
Please don't pull your boxes, they're one of the reason we stuck to this<br>
hobby at the start.<br>

Sounds to me like someone has been targeting your boxes, such as they can.<br>
As if Geocachers or someone else has stumbled across the clues and have<br>
decided to remove the letterboxes for whatever their reason... Specially<br>
coupled with these strange emails you've received.<br>
<br>
I guess we can only do one thing in a case like this... Outlast them.  When<br>
they find them, I move them to a different spot.  To get the clues from the<br>
PNWLb site, you have to be a registered member of the site. The system<br>
tracks who's been viewing your boxes and will indicate the viewing history<br>
to you.<br>
<br>
That's about the only things I can think of to still get to enjoy my hobby<br>
and not call it quits.<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening,<br>

I think its time to go underground.  I think that you should assume <br>
that alias you have been toying with and leave the dn2r to others for <br>
a while.  You have been so prominent in the last year that you have <br>
attracted too much attention to yourself.  Time to blend into the <br>
background and move stealthily.  I would expect that any new boxes <br>
you place will be mysteries from now on.  <br>
<br>
Being exiled didnt stop Evil Glenn, being singled out for sabotage <br>
shouldnt stop you either.  <br>
<br>
You go girl!<br>

P.S.  I found the orca box a few weeks ago along with the pagoda <br>
box.  Both were great boxes, clues, stamps, and locations.  I am glad <br>
to have known them.<br>

I feel your pain yet I don't want to believe that anyone would be purposely targeting your letterboxes. The best way to get to your enemy is to forgive him and go on with your life or in this case letterboxing. Don't be a sniveling wimp Bethany wipe your nose and go carve a stamp. Sheesh. They didn't eat one of your kids. Get over it. In time the driver in front of you will be far more irritating and if there is a culprit they will still have to deal with the Karma they created.  <br>
