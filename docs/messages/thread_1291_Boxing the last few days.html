                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went out for a bit yesterday to do the "Salmon Creek series" in Vancouver<br>
to find box #3 MIA.  Great stamps that is for sure.  Today we went with<br>
Campfire Lady to Troutdale, OR.  The series "What can I get you" at<br>
McMenamins are both MIA.  I was wondering if you can double stamp in the<br>
Purple Heart Letterbox?  I seem to have problems falling down and twisting<br>
ankles.  Two twists and one fall today.  We did the "Jungle Animal series"<br>
with all present and A rose by any other name" and all of the ones at<br>
Whitaker Pond.  It was not too bad of a day, but I need to put my klutsey<br>
feet up now.  Willow.  <br>
