It's the food extravaganza holiday, once again. Does this mean we're in for a new <br/>
offering from those elusive Forest People? My fingers are crossed! After consuming <br/>
my share of way too much food, I'm hoping to hit the trail and find a box or two. It's <br/>
so wonderful to have letterboxing and not TV sports as my favorite pastime. Have a <br/>
grand holiday everyone. Funhog<br/>

Ryan and I helped a fellow letterboxer move into the Seattle area this<br/>
morning!  The infamous Canada Goose has flown in and settled mere<br/>
blocks away from me.  We toted some boxes with the Secret Gardeners<br/>
and Canada Goose this morning (fueled by Tim Hortons Donut Holes<br/>
imported from BC). Once the computer gets hooked up, we are sure to<br/>
hear more from the Goose. I know  she'll plant a few boxes in the<br/>
area. I saw the moving box with all the letterboxing supplies :-)<br/>
