                    <div class="plaintext-content">In the Sunday Daily Olympian (known locally as the Daily Zero, for good reason) had an article on geocaching, which you can find at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.theolympian.com/home/news/20030831/living/88742_ARC.shtml<br/>
<br/>
Makes the hobby sound like great fun without mentioning the negative aspects.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah Jackson also wrote an article about Book Crossing, from the SSM left outside the Daily 0 by my wife, EskieLover (who was at the South Sound Summer gathering, with her box 'o books).  It can be found at <br/>
<br/>
http://www.theolympian.com/home/news/20030830/living/87775_ARC.shtml<br/>
<br/>
Sarah got the info from Morgan during a phone interview, did the research, and came up with the article.  Even though she didn't get her last name in there, she did well.<br/>
<br/>
If ever publicity is wanted, Sarah appears to be a good option.<br/>
