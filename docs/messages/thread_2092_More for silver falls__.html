<br/>
I am looking forward to joining the festivities @ Silver Falls, the <br/>
first weekend of July.  I hope to bring Fun Gal, Handyman, and Ginky <br/>
to the event on Saturday for the day.  So 4 more!  We started <br/>
letterboxing a year and a-half ago, after reading an article in<br/>
Family Fun mag.  I've introduced the hobby to my friends but they <br/>
aren't as crazy about it as I (maybe simply not as crazy!) So time to <br/>
meet others!  Really looking forward to the authors and artists of<br/>
our favorite letterboxes.  Funhog's "Discovery Trail" was our first <br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
Is the exchange/ pot luck event due to happen on Sat.?<br/>
