HI! For some reason I keep getting kicked out of the group and yahoo <br/>
says that my email adress is invalid and that it is "Bouncing" and <br/>
then asks me to respond to an email from yahoo sent to my supposedly <br/>
inactive email adress to reactivate my account. So far this has <br/>
happened 4 times. Any explanations might be helpful. I havent changed <br/>
my email adress in 8 years and I recieve the emails from yahoo so I <br/>
am stumped as too why it says I am "Bouncing" and need to reactivate <br/>
my account continuously. <br/>
<br/>

Actually, I think I know the answer to this.  =)  (I'm the owner of<br/>
the group, but the group doesn't tell me anything when e-mails bounce.<br/>
 Mostly behind-the-scenes kind of stuff that owners and moderators<br/>
don't have to worry about.)<br/>
<br/>
But to get to the point, it's probably because you're using a<br/>
Microsoft accout.  Their Hotmail and MSN accounts have gotten pretty<br/>
strict when it comes to e-mail, and the only permament solution I know<br/>
of is to register with a non-Mircosoft account.  Microsoft has been<br/>
getting VERY strict in order to help eliminate spam, and the<br/>
configuration needs to be set *pricisely* for mail to get sent.  I<br/>
don't think Yahoo Groups has configured their servers quite so<br/>
pricisely and it's tripping the Hotmail/MSN accounts into bouncing the<br/>
e-mails as spam.  Then when Yahoo Groups gets the bounced message, it<br/>
inactivates your account.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I even know this is because virtually everyone with a<br/>
Microsoft-based account on Atlas Quest has been getting their e-mails<br/>
bounced for that very reason.  Took me two months to finally get the<br/>
configuration JUST right where e-mail to Hotmail or MSN accounts have<br/>
stopped bouncing.  (The bounces weren't specific JUST to Microsoft<br/>
accounts, but 9 out of 10 bounces probably came from them.)  Yahoo and<br/>
Gmail accounts don't seem to be quite as picky, if you're looking for<br/>
other free alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

How do I email someone offlist? I tried clicking on an email adress <br/>
but it came up as a regular posting. I would like to submit my adress <br/>
for the Spring postal letterbox but dont want to display my adress to <br/>
the entire group (no offense guys). I also tried going to <br/>
the "members" page and looking up the members yahoo ID but that didnt <br/>
work either. Thanks. <br/>
