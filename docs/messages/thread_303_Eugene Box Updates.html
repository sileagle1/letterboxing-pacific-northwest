to find both his Skinner's Butte box and Sprout's Spencer's Butte <br>
box--both of which are still in excellent condition!  <br>

Yesterday, I got out to search for a couple of boxes:<br>
<br>
Airpark Box--Very nice little box, with a great logbook (I never knew<br>
there was frisbee golf so close to where I live!!)<br>
<br>
Fire Hydrant Box--I'm quite positive that I was looking in the right<br>
spot, but after searching for quite awhile (and getting repeatedly<br>
pricked by the blackberry bushes!) I gave up.  Could I get more hints<br>
for this one?<br>
<br>
A couple of weeks ago, I found the following boxes and had not gotten<br>
around to giving an update for them:<br>
<br>
Rhododendron Box--Beautiful stamp and logbook!<br>
Eugene Skinner Box--Another good one!  Although I had to be very<br>
cautious about all of the drunk people on the butte that day!<br>
<br>
Great boxes!  I'm glad to see that more and more are being placed in<br>
Eugene and Springfield!!<br>
