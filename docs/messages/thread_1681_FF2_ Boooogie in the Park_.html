<br>
Come and share in the greatest traditions of All Hallows Eve as we<br>
celebrate a northwest tradition, The second annual Halloween Gathering.<br>
<br>
This years event, aptly named FF2: Booooo-gie in the Park - Echoes of<br>
Times Past plans on being mush larger than last years event.  Team Chaos<br>
and Team Rayvenhaus are jointly hosting this event and are each planting<br>
a series of boxes for this event.<br>
<br>
What we would like to also offer is for anyone who can not make it to<br>
this gathering but would still like to participate in some way, to go<br>
ahead and carve up a themed stamp, make a box and ship it to us and we<br>
would be happy to plant and maintain it, listing you as the creator of<br>
that box. If you'd like to take us up on this, contact RayvenMom at<br>
rayvenmom 'at' lbworld.org and she'll give you the snail mail address to<br>
send it to.<br>
<br>
We invite everyone that can make it to come and join us, meet some of<br>
the people behind the posts. There will be a potluck so please bring a<br>
covered dish, a salad, something to eat, enough for your group and share<br>
with your friends. Bring your own sodas or other assorted drinks, (minus<br>
alcohol of course, this is a dry park).<br>
<br>
We want to remind everyone that nthis is a kid friendly event, by all<br>
means, bring your children, this event will ensure that they don't kjust<br>
sit and play in the playground all day!!!<br>
<br>
Although this is a Halloween themed gathering, this is not a costume<br>
party of any sort.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. A warm thank you to Funhog.<br>
