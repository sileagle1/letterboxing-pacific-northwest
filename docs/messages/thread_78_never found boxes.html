One other note: to our knowledge five of our boxes have never been <br>
found: Nehalem Bay, Alaska Souvinier, Wedding Mystery, Hummingbird <br>
Bonus, and Chief Kno-Tah. <br>
<br>
May I point out that possibly no one has found Chief Kno-Tah could <br>
be because it does not make sense?<br>
I first thought this to be a great challenge, but now I just think <br>
you are crazy:)<br>

Congradulations on your anniversary.<br>

I think I may know.....  But we haven't ventured out that way yet.  We'll <br>
have to make sure we do that soon!  <br>
