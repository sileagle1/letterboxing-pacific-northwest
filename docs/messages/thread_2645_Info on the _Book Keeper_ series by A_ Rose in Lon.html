<br>
I started  A. Rose's Book Keeper series in Longview Washington a few <br>
years ago,then moved. I cannot find the clues or any reference to <br>
these boxes online anywhere.I don't necessarily need the clues, but a <br>
heads up if they are still around would be nice since my time is so <br>
limited up that way.<br>
<br>
 Does  anyone know if these boxes are still active? I am headed back <br>
up there and really want to finish the series.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Cami<br>

If you are down in longview, it's not too far of a drive to go <br>
to "Millersylvania State Park"   There are some really nice <br>
letterboxes there, and our family spent 2 days finding all of them.  <br>
If you want a list of them, take a look at my logbook on atlas quest<br>

I think I found the box that held another one but there wasn't a stamp <br>

When will you be coming up this way?  Maybe we could exchange?  or <br>
even search wake robin.  I have found a few out there...would have <br>
looked for more but my crew had had enough! <br>
