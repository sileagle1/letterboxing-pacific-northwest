                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We thought we'd post a brief report on our great trip to the Portland area.<br/>
We began by spending 5 days in the Columbia River gorge. There were an<br/>
amazing variety of waterfalls and it was fun to walk behind some of them!<br/>
We especially enjoyed the free fall drop of Latourell Falls and Tunnel<br/>
Falls.  Up on the high points we usually had very good views of the river<br/>
gorge (except on our way up Dog Mountain, when we were hiking in a cloud).<br/>
Another highlight on some of our hikes were the blackberries - fat, sweet<br/>
and juicy and more plentiful than we could believe!  We ended up having<br/>
stained hands not from our inkpads, but from gobbling up so many berries. It<br/>
was also interesting to see those fat slugs in a variety of colors (however<br/>
THEY certainly didn't look very appetizing!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since we enjoy hiking in the mountains, we chose to do some of the more<br/>
challenging hikes.  These included Angel's Rest, Nesmith Point, Dog<br/>
Mountain, Hamilton Mountain, Triple Falls and Tunnel Falls. We found lots of<br/>
boxes along the way and especially appreciate the people that place boxes on<br/>
longer hikes (Green Tortuga of course, Funhog, Der Mad Stamper and Double<br/>
Tree).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed doing the Tunnel Falls hike with Funhog and Pungent Bob and<br/>
appreciated Funhog organizing a dinner at a brewpub that evening.  It was<br/>
great to meet some of the local boxers, including Der (famous) Mad Stamper!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We spent the next 2 days at State Parks.  We had a very busy and long day at<br/>
Silver Falls.  Once again we enjoyed a variety of waterfalls and took a VERY<br/>
BUMPY road way back in to find a box series in a remote area.  Unfortunately<br/>
we couldn't get to the best access point for one of the Green Tortuga's<br/>
boxes  the road to the trailhead was gated and we were told we would<br/>
probably be ticketed if we parked there.  Since we didn't have enough time<br/>
left in the day to take the longer route, we had to pass it by.  The next<br/>
day was a little more low-key at Milo McIver Park where we did some shorter<br/>
walks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We spent the last 2 days in the Mount Hood area.  We hiked around Trillium<br/>
Lake, up to Twin Lakes and Mirror Lake the first day.  That night we headed<br/>
into Gresham where Maiden had organized another group dinner.  We<br/>
appreciated her efforts to help us meet more local boxers and it was another<br/>
fun night of exchanging stories and signature stamps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our last day in the area we hiked to the pretty Ramona Falls and then hiked<br/>
up to McNeil Point.  This was our absolute favorite hike of the whole trip!!<br/>
Fantastic views of Mount Hood and the surrounding mountain ranges in the<br/>
distance.  Even heard the glacier crack/rumble!  And as the icing on the<br/>
cake, we were successful in finding the box on the trail - but it certainly<br/>
wasn't a quick find...  A definite sense of accomplishment since we're not<br/>
really too good at picture clues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We placed 2 boxes during our trip and will post clues soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your hospitality and the great boxes!<br/>
<br/>

P.S.  We've sent individual messages to all the placers to give a status<br/>
update on the boxes we looked for.  If anyone is curious to see the list of<br/>
those we attempted, you can see it at:<br/>

I'm kind of surprised more people haven't tried to get that McNeil<br/>
Point box, because you're right--it's an AWESOME hike! =) Kind of<br/>
makes the Columiba River Gorge look boring in comparison, huh? So what<br/>
were you? The third person to have ever found that box? ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Ever since I planted that box, I've wanted to thru-hike the Timberline<br/>
Trail around Mount Hood. If that one little area is that pretty,<br/>
imagine how amazing hiking the whole trail would be! <br/>
