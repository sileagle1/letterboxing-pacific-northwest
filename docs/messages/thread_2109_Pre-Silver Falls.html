from Silverton. If you get to the North Falls parking area, <br>
you've gone too far. Tent spaces A, B and C are on the <br>
left as you enter the area, before you get to the recycling <br>
bins. There are fire rings and picnic tables and I plan on <br>
bringing some firewood with me. Gotta have those s'mores <br>
to go with the Krispy Kremes. <br>
<br>
I also picked up a brochure for a RV Park in Silverton that <br>
might be an option if there are folks who want to camp but <br>
don't have a spot reserved with Pungent Bob. The place is <br>
called Silver Spur RV Park and the phone  number is 503.874.9045<br>
Can you tell I'm excited about a weekend of camping at one<br>
of my favorite places? I'm even scheming on a trail ride while<br>
I'm there. Yee Haw!!! Funhog<br>
