We're pleased that it has been so popular and has lasted there all this <br/>

Are there any Vancouver-area boxers or visitors who could put in a new <br/>

I can send postage money, and a carved stamp if you like.<br/>

response. Zara and I would be happy to replace the "Pole-to-Pole"<br/>
logbook, but I would like confirmation that this hasn't already been<br/>
done. It's a 60 - 90 minute drive, so we want to plan the day before<br/>
we leave. :)<br/>
