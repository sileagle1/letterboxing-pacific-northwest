looking for help/tips on carving, the Tacoma Nature Center at Snake <br/>
Lake in Tacoma (in conjunction with the Metro Parks System) is <br/>
hosting a Letterboxing Clinic, Sat, 17 Sep 05 from 10am-11:30am.  <br/>
Cost is $2 for children (5&amp;up), $4 for adults.  Register at 253-591-<br/>
6439.  If you don't register in advance but decide early Saturday <br/>
morning that you'd like to attend I doubt they'd have any issue with <br/>
that--they have a large facility and plenty of workstations for the <br/>
event.  There will be several letterboxes planted for this event.  <br/>
<br/>
Earlier today I volunteered to teach parts of the class, the staff <br/>
of the Nature Center will teach other parts.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there,<br/>

Nope, I'd never deserve to be on a pedestal like that.  The real story <br/>
behind it all boils down to me not wanting to carve an 'A' in front of <br/>
my trail name on my signature stamp back when I couldn't carve a stamp <br/>
to save my life.  Sheer laziness...  ;)  dvn2r ckr<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The 17 Sep Tacoma Nature Center Letterboxing Workshop went really <br/>
well.  I can't remember the exact number of folks who attended but it <br/>
was over a dozen adults and a handful of children.  Everybody left with <br/>
a signature stamp and a logbook and set out on the trail to find some <br/>
nature-themed letterboxes immediately after the class.<br/>
<br/>
The center is interested in hosting future classes on the 'sub-topics' <br/>
of letterboxing--bookbinding, stamp carving, etc.  So keep your eyes <br/>
posted for future events.  Looks like they'll have a workshop in Dec <br/>
and Jan on one or two of these yet TBD topics.  It was so nice to get <br/>
to meet some active letterboxers in the area, too--after exchanging <br/>
emails for, in some cases, a couple of years it was nice to finally get <br/>
to meet the letterboxers in person.<br/>
