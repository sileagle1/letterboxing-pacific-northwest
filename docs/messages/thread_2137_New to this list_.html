                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi.  We just discovered this group this weekend and joined it <br>
today.  We are Ronnie and Winnie and we live in Vancouver.  We have <br>
been involved in letterboxing for about 4 months now and thought we <br>
should introduce ourselves since we just joined the group. A family <br>
member of ours in Connecticut told us about the sport and we looked <br>
it up on the internet and decided to give it a try. We were really <br>
amazed at how many letterboxes are in our own town! Our first <br>
letterboxing experience was at Battleground Lake since Ronnie works <br>
near there. We even placed our first letterbox last month at Factice <br>
Creek in Vancouver. We were thrilled yesterday when we checked on <br>
our box and found that we had our first visitor and just a couple of <br>
days ago! We were so excited to find that someone would actually <br>
look for our box! :) This is really cool!!!  Thank you Funhog, <br>
whoever you are, for the kind words about the stamp. I am not very <br>
artistic (even if Ronnie says so) and it took me four tries to make <br>
one I felt comfortable enough to put out there for people to <br>
actually see. I am afraid that is not as good as what most of you <br>
other letterboxers carve.<br>
<br>
Our work schedules dont allow us to get out very much but we try to <br>
whenever we can. We see from the recent posts on this board that we <br>
missed a group event down at Silver Falls.  Too bad we didnt know <br>
about it at the time, we actually could have attended. At least, we <br>
had the weekend free. Ronnie is a bit shy about meeting large groups <br>
of people we dont know. I am a little more adventurous and would be <br>
interested in getting to know some of you on line so we can learn <br>
the tricks of this game.  <br>
<br>
I have heard from my cousin in Connecticut that there are many very <br>
interesting mystery letterboxes available in this area but I cant <br>
seem to find clues to them.  She said something about WOM clues but <br>
I dont know what she meant. Can anyone tell us what a WOM is?  <br>
<br>
Winnie, new to this group and very excited to have found it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gosh! I was so please to find your very first letterbox. <br>
I was a bit confused by the clues at first but I finally <br>
fumbled through and found the hiding place. I'm sure <br>
practice will make clue writing easier for you. <br>
<br>
As for the stamp, no need to be the least bit embarrassed <br>
by your maiden effort. It's VERY cute! I absolutely love <br>
having it in my book.There too, practice will sharpen your <br>
skills. Keep in mind that any handcarved stamp is a million <br>
times better than one bought off the shelf. The gift of your <br>
artwork is a special type of communication, one I'm <br>
pleased to receive. Thank you and welcome to our wacky<br>
hobby, Funhog<br>
