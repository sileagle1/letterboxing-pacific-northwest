like we had either wind or more wind, or much much more wind. We did <br/>
have a beautiful view of the lake and the very best part was our <br/>
visitors.<br/>
<br/>
 Amanda and Ryan came early and stayed for a few days and on the 27th <br/>
Birder showed up about noon after planting a letterbox nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Heron-a-foot straggled in with Peaches, Yiker, Spike , Coondra and <br/>
Onyx came next.CaliK was dropped off and Funhog and Keith showed up <br/>
sportin a new Trailer. (Seems like the older you get the more you <br/>
start leaning toward comfort)<br/>
To top things off all the way from Portland came the three Boxers, <br/>
Maiden, Marmalade, and Camp Fire Lady.<br/>
<br/>
The chow was pretty eclectic, mostly salads, but no one turned down <br/>
freshly caught trout.<br/>
<br/>
We handed out the WOM clues and everyone found as many as they <br/>
wanted, but primarily settled in for letterboxing chat.<br/>
<br/>
It was really fun for us to meet new friends and say hello to old <br/>
friends.Thanks to all that came. See you in the future.<br/>

This is the best part of letterboxing!!!<br/>

Hey, I totally agree with you two - I could only stay an hour and had<br/>
no time to find any of the letterboxes, but it was still worth the<br/>
trip meeting you (and of course getting the trailer trash image).  I'm<br/>
usually all for the socializing anyway.  Sorry I missed chatting with<br/>
Marmie, CFL and Maiden, but the hugs were appreciated anyway - if I<br/>
hadn't forgotten my pack and come back for it I would have missed you<br/>
entirely - another time, my friends.  I plan to get back to Suttle<br/>
Lake and would appreciate any clues that are still WOM and/or links to<br/>
postings of such.  Birder gave me one hand-written clue, but I know<br/>
there were more.  I'll definitely check LBNA and AQ before I go but<br/>
don't want to miss any goodies.  Still working on getting my foot in<br/>
working order and have not given up on that, hope to be out hiking<br/>
again before winter.  Thanks so much for sharing your campsite with us<br/>
- it was indeed a wonderful view.  <br/>
