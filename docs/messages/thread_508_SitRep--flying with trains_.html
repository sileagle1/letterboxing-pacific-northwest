I'm curious about this waving-arms-as-if-in-flight near trains, tho...  I <br/>
can't say that I've ever experienced this in my (apparently sheltered) life.  <br/>
Does it create the sensation of flight--or something--or is it done to confound <br/>
people on the train who might be watching you ;o) ????<br/>

Years ago, when I sailed the ocean blue, one of my crewmates and I would jump <br/>
up &amp; down on the deck during an oncoming sea.  The trick was to jump up just <br/>
as the ship dropped down into a trough, so that you would rise *FAR* higher <br/>
above the deck than an ordinary jump could take you--generally with arms <br/>
windmilling wildly in an attempt to remain upright so freaking-high up in the air.  <br/>
Actually the real trick--as the ship came up and we came down--was to land back <br/>
on the deck without breaking a leg...which luckily, we never did, since our <br/>
droll captain claimed he wouldn't take either of us "idiots" to port for a <br/>
doctor if we did!<br/>

&gt; I can see that Team Rayvenhaus are people who know how to have fun!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I've had worse said about me than, "I know how to have fun", so thanks!<br/>
(grin) I appreciate that. In 41 years (Almost 42) I've realized that it's to<br/>
short not to have fun. Why else would I come whooping out of a thicket, with<br/>
a Tupperware box in one hand screaming "I found it, I found it", as if I had<br/>
discovered the lost book of Atlantis, all the while feeling as if I was<br/>
Indiana Jones?<br/>

Well, no actually.  It's background is shrouded in antiquity. It was first<br/>
noticed in the prehistoric times when early man was attempting to wave off<br/>
an attacking T-Rex. Alas, it didn't work.  The next instance was in biblical<br/>
times when the Isrealittes attacked Jericho. The defenders were seen yelling<br/>
and waving their arms just before the walls fell. It was next seen in<br/>
medieval times when hordes of attacking bandits were storming a castle,<br/>
though no one was really sure just what the Earl was attempting to<br/>
accomplish by standing on the turret waving his arms in that manner.  Next,<br/>
we find it in more recent times, used by the crowds of people greeting<br/>
Lindenbergh when he crossed the Atlantic and landed in France, although it<br/>
almost made him veer off and land somewhere else at first.  More and more we<br/>
are seeing it at major sporting events and other gatherings of large numbers<br/>
of people, perhaps with the idea that a large number of people will reach a<br/>
'critical' mass and cause spontaneous flight? One does not know.  However,<br/>
in this case, it was meant to illicit a  response from the engineers of the<br/>
train and cause them to respond with a long blast of the train whistle.<br/>
Which they were kind enough to do, given that two full grown adults were<br/>
standing on the boarded up train station as if they were just waiting for<br/>
the 10:12 to pull in from Seattle, wildly waiving thier arms and hollering<br/>
their fool heads off.  I mean, what else could they do?<br/>
<br/>
All in all, we are enjoying this and it is giving us a chance to do more<br/>
together.<br/>
