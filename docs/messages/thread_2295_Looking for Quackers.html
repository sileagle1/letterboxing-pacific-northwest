<br>
I'm new to letterboxing. Accidentally went looking for Der Mad Stamper's <br>
Elk Island box last week (haven't found it yet - bad weather and <br>
children hampered the effort) and am now hooked.  I Live in Sellwood so <br>
I went to find the Quackers box today (found Adele & Sophia nearby <br>
yesterday) and was unable.  Found the cache (traded a toy spoon for some <br>
christmas decorations) and the quintet, but couldn't find the box.  <br>
Found the fuzzy trees on the litle plateau just past that and looked for <br>
45 minutes, found lots of frogs but not box.  Also checked likely <br>
candidates nearby to no avail.  Has it been seen recently?  Did I miss <br>
something?  Any help is appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
Scott<br>
