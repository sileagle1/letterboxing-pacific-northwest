right now. We had a great time at the gathering. So fun to put a few more<br/>
trail names and faces together. The exchange was fun even though the boys<br/>
didn't get to keep the ornaments they wanted. Shame on you guys for stealing<br/>
from children! =) First time they have ever been involved in a gift<br/>
exchange, we tried to warn them. But I like the ornaments we got. It took me<br/>
a while to figure out that the mailbox was a letterbox, duh! I kept thinking<br/>
about PLBs. It also took some time to associate the fact that Wood Splinters<br/>
made it because he is a carver (I assume). It was so perfect it was hard to<br/>
believe it was handmade. And then the name on the letterbox L.B. Dartmoor.<br/>
All so clever. And then our snowflake (don't know who made that) and Happy<br/>
Holidays stamp made by Pupp. They will be great memories to put on the tree<br/>
through the years. Lots of fun. Oh, and our mini letterboxes from Tina,<br/>
where did you find those cute little containers? My kids are having friends<br/>
over this evening that letterbox, we might just have to get some clues set<br/>
up to find it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Campfire Lady and everyone else,<br/>
