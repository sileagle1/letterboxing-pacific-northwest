well so far for mine. <br/>
<br/>
The only one that I could see might be in trouble would be the 2nd <br/>
one, Angel Flight.  <br/>
<br/>
She said what she saw for any work on the trail was not affecting <br/>
any of my boxes, so feel free to pursue them.  If anything changes, <br/>
I will let people know.<br/>
<br/>
And I can't imagine that Green Tortuga's African Safari box will <br/>
EVER be in danger.  More likely, you are in danger of poison oak <br/>
while getting it!<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could have gotten Funhog's box when I was up there planting <br/>
my series but I walked down in the dark and couldn't stop and look <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, Funhog, you will be able to replace it somewhere soon.<br/>
<br/>
I also love that you had a "guardian angel" watching your box and <br/>
guarding it.  How wonderful!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Your boxes are all just dandy. I was up there a couple of weeks back with another boxer <br/>
who found them all with no problem whatsoever. The entire section of trail where my box <br/>
was hidden is no more. The area is blocked and a new trail has been cut nowhere near the <br/>
old hiding place. The log is gone and the landmark boulder cannot be seen at all from the <br/>
new trail. Your boxes are on sections that have been tended to but not rerouted. The trail <br/>
maintenance is wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I had the pleasure of meeting my guardian angel (who incidentally is of the tatooed, <br/>
pierced variety and goes by the moniker Zombiedoom) who has been boxing as long as I <br/>
have! This particular Zombie has a box hidden way up on Cooper Spur that I've been <br/>
gunning for for years. I just haven't made the time. Perhaps this summer will be the time. <br/>
