well so far for mine. <br>
<br>
The only one that I could see might be in trouble would be the 2nd <br>
one, Angel Flight.  <br>
<br>
She said what she saw for any work on the trail was not affecting <br>
any of my boxes, so feel free to pursue them.  If anything changes, <br>
I will let people know.<br>
<br>
And I can't imagine that Green Tortuga's African Safari box will <br>
EVER be in danger.  More likely, you are in danger of poison oak <br>
while getting it!<br>
<br>
Wish I could have gotten Funhog's box when I was up there planting <br>
my series but I walked down in the dark and couldn't stop and look <br>
around.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, Funhog, you will be able to replace it somewhere soon.<br>
<br>
I also love that you had a "guardian angel" watching your box and <br>
guarding it.  How wonderful!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Your boxes are all just dandy. I was up there a couple of weeks back with another boxer <br>
who found them all with no problem whatsoever. The entire section of trail where my box <br>
was hidden is no more. The area is blocked and a new trail has been cut nowhere near the <br>
old hiding place. The log is gone and the landmark boulder cannot be seen at all from the <br>
new trail. Your boxes are on sections that have been tended to but not rerouted. The trail <br>
maintenance is wonderful.<br>
<br>
I had the pleasure of meeting my guardian angel (who incidentally is of the tatooed, <br>
pierced variety and goes by the moniker Zombiedoom) who has been boxing as long as I <br>
have! This particular Zombie has a box hidden way up on Cooper Spur that I've been <br>
gunning for for years. I just haven't made the time. Perhaps this summer will be the time. <br>
