While stopping to find a couple Geocaches in the Southbound rest area south of <br>
Wilsonville, OR, I could see a cache from over fifty feet away.  It was out of <br>
hiding sitting on a stump.<br>
Upon inspection, it wasn't a geocache, but a letter box with a log.  But, no <br>
cache name that I could see.<br>
A search of your site does not help me to find it so the owner can be notified <br>
of how I rehid it.<br>
Oh, and since we have done quite a few hybrid geo/letterbox finds, we also left <br>
our note and stamped the log.<br>
