                    <div class="plaintext-content">I headed out this afternoon to stretch my legs before a day of overindulgence. In my travels, I found three <br/>
letterboxes, sent a couple of hitch hikers on their merry way and found another one that needs to find a home. <br/>
One of the hitchers set free today was created by ace carver Franzsolo from Ohio. This one is a real treat. I <br/>
also decided to take a look at my Sandy Delta box which I haven't visited for quite a while. <br/>
<br/>
It seems that no one else has visited it for quite a while either, the last entry being made last February. The <br/>
box is just fine. The area has undergone amazing changes. Anyone who has been there before owes it to <br/>
themselves to go have a look. You won't recognize the place. In the past, acres and acres were swallowed up <br/>
by the dreaded Himalayan Blackberry. Now there are huge expanses of tilled earth with hundreds of baby <br/>
trees planted on some areas. There are no more stiles, fences or gates, just open land with lots of birds! This <br/>
location has undergone dramatic changes every time I've been there and today was no exception. Funhog<br/>

My poor little Oaks Bottom box was most unhappy being crowded out of it's little <br/>
apartment by that big ol' letterbox that someone had put in the same hiding place. I <br/>
went to have a look at it yesterday and just as I had suspected, the box was so big <br/>
that it was plainly visible from the trail. Since there was no contact info in the box, I <br/>
took it upon myself to christen the usurper, "The Big Y" letterbox and evicted it. It <br/>
now is living happily in its own home along the same trail. The new clue can be found <br/>
inside the Oaks Bottom box. <br/>
<br/>
One good thing I can say about this box is that it is downright HUGE and would make <br/>
a dandy Hitch Hiker Hostel. None of its contents are currently protected by plastic <br/>
bags and since I had none with me yesterday, I couldn't do the necessary first aid. If <br/>
you're headed that way please take a couple of extras and wrap up the contents. <br/>
Hopefully, I haven't spoiled some kids' fun but it really was necessary to move The Big <br/>
Y to protect it and it's roomate from accidental discovery. Anyone know who owns <br/>
this one? Funhog<br/>
