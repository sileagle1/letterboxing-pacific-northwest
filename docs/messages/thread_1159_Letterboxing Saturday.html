letterboxing.  Since we were late for any breakfast meet-up with others,<br/>

thought we'd see  Brindle Babe, Melanie, and the others on the huntdown,<br/>

Anyone who wants to get their "F" count up in a fast and furious way<br/>
ought to hit Troutdale and Gresham.  All the boxes we got were pretty<br/>
much drive-bys.  Not much hiking or walking involved.  It was very windy<br/>
out there, but sunny and the stamps we got are lovely.  I think we<br/>
mostly got Sleepy Whippet and Melanie boxes and one from a backwards<br/>
Pezman or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
Also...Twinkletoes, whoever you are...I LOVE YOUR BIG SIGNATURE STAMP.<br/>
It's a beautiful carve!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Carie for a fun afternoon of 'boxing in East County.  It's<br/>
been a long, long time since I've done any letterboxing, and there were<br/>
no stamps in my book since the Roadhouse Gathering in December.  How<br/>
pathetic is that?  Life has just been too busy in other ways.  Maybe<br/>
come spring and summer I will be able to get out and about more!  I<br/>
don't think I've place anything new since last September, so I ought to<br/>
think of doing some new letterboxes.<br/>

Also..Thanks to Dave for his e-mail about my White-Fronted Bee Eater.  I<br/>
will try to get over to this box when I have a chance.  Thanks for the<br/>

the two of you.  I've been looking forward to meeting you both. I hope I'll<br/>
still get the chance.  We do have lots of boxes out here that are fairly<br/>
short hikes, but we have a few that are longer.  I think the longest hike we<br/>
have in the area is the Beaver Creek Box, wonderful hike, but be prepared<br/>
for muddy paths and having to scale really high steps. The old stairs are<br/>
gone so there's several places you have to climb up and down make shift<br/>
ones.  The Oxbow Series box and Riversbend are also good hikes.  Even my<br/>
Springwater Trail #1 is a decent stretch of the legs.<br/>
