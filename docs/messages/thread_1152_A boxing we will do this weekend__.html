                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well it all started out at the Spagettti Factory in Vancouver where <br/>
we met Bindle Babe from Michigan.  We were joined by Maiden, Tooth <br/>
Fairy, Jay Jeopardy, Dad, Bookworm, Sleepy Whippet, Campfire Lady <br/>
and Cat's Meow.  It was a great night.  I got razzed because I did <br/>
not make an event stamp.  So of course this caused me to wake up in <br/>
the night several times. I thought about what stamp I could <br/>
scramble and do the next morning before we set out again with the <br/>
same bunch and a few more boxers.  I have only carved 2 stamps so <br/>
far. I decided on a "Circle of friends" event stamp.  And I have to <br/>
say I was proud of myself.  Campfire Lady came to pick us up and I <br/>
asked her to do my writing on it because she has way better hand <br/>
writting than poor old Willlow. I will have to get the event stamp <br/>
to Bookworm and Sleepy Whippet who did not join us Saturday. We then <br/>
went to meet most of the same bunch plus MomNoTime, Mini Bully Mom, <br/>
Pupp and Jenn at West Linn to do all of the boxes that were there.  <br/>
We had a great time and found all that there was to be found.  2 <br/>
boxes in the Mom, Mexico &amp; Me series were MIA.  But talk about some <br/>
great carved stamps by these wonderful boxers.  It was so nice to <br/>
meet a few new friends and box with some old ones.  It was a <br/>
beautiful day for this hobby and I hope many of you were out as we <br/>
were.  Willow,Daisey and Heartsey.<br/>
