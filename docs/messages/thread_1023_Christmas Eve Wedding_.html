<br>
Thank you all for your thoughts and well wishes.  The wedding will be <br>
held in our home, a small private yet elegant ceremony.  Then the <br>
massive announcements afterwards that make all my family and friends <br>
feel obligated to send presents (snicker)  my parents are flying in <br>
from California and Iron Bear's daughter will be with us of course, <br>
then just a couple very close friends.<br>
<br>
As for the cake sorry Carrie my mother is doing the cake.  While I <br>
am sure something by you would have been much better it is something <br>
she has always wanted and always dreamed of doing.  She took cake <br>
classes for years when I was a teenager just hoping that someday I <br>
would get married and she could do the cake.  Alas the time has come <br>
and well, she is so excited I could never take that away from her.<br>
<br>
I am sure we will have some photos to share afterwards, things are <br>
just so crazy right now, I don't even think we have managed to tell <br>
all our friends and family yet.  But that is what the announcements <br>
are for right? (Laugh)<br>
<br>
I wish you all a happy holiday, and will see you all again soon once <br>
I recover from this surgery thing.  I promise some great carvings in <br>
the meant time!<br>
