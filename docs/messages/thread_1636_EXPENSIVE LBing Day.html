                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I letterbox, at remote trailheads, I like to bring my <br>
*submarine* with me.  My *submarine* is my 180 pound male Great Dane <br>
named Poh.  He is almost 10 years old so he actually prefers to stay <br>
in the van while we go hiking.  Our female Charity would rather go <br>
hiking so this works out nicely.  What he does is he lays in the <br>
back of the van and waits for anyone to come near it.  When they do <br>
he then pops up and starts violently barking and the van actually <br>
starts shaking back and forth.  I have stood back and watched him do <br>
this and the reaction from passing people.  I probably should set up <br>
a video camera so I could win the $10,000 from America's Funniest <br>
Home Videos.  <br>
<br>
I know that this solution isn't practical for everyone and I am also <br>
unable to do it if the weather is too warm, but it has saved me the <br>
worry about break-ins while in remote locations.  I think that I <br>
will have to go to Pandemonium LB again and set some bad guys up!  <br>
LOL!  <br>

Happy Boxing!<br>
