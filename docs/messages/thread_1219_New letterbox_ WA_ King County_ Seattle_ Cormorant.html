Cormorant Cove Park Letterbox<br/>
Seattle, Washington<br/>
King County<br/>
Directions to Cormorant Cove Park can be found at:<br/>
http://www.cityofseattle.net/parks/parkspaces/cormorantcove.htm<br/>
3701 Beach Drive Southwest<br/>
Hours of the park are 4:30 AM to 11:30 PM.<br/>
Clue Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Terrain: Easy, with some scrambling over boulders and driftwood. Kid friendly!<br/>
Bring a camera, binoculars and a lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Cormorant Cove Park is located at the T-intersection of 61st Ave. SW and<br/>
Beach Drive SW. As a kid, I grew up in this neighborhood. At that time, the<br/>
Beach Drive Market was located here. It was a nice Mom and Pop store where<br/>
we'd grab a cold drink or some candy on the way home. After the Market was<br/>
torn down, the lot was left empty. The City of Seattle purchased it and<br/>
installed the present Cormorant Cove Park. It's a great place to bird watch.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Find the metal handrail that has images of cormorants woven in it. Walk<br/>
down the steps. At the bottom of the steps, head 120 degrees (all readings<br/>
are magnetic) for 38 paces. Face 240 degrees and take 19 paces. Here you<br/>
will find a circular patio with a mosaic pattern of a Cormorant at its<br/>
center. Take time to read about the cormorant, the park and other birds you<br/>
may see from this location.<br/>
<br/>
Retrace your steps to the base of the metal cormorant handrail. With the<br/>
handrail to your back, bear 260 degrees for 15 paces. Did you find a bench?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, we grabbed firsties on this one this afternoon! Once again, the <br/>
box (nice stamp!) was secondary to discovering a great new spot.<br/>
<br/>
A delightful little park--we hit it at a very low tide, and the kids <br/>
had a ball counting anemones and barnacles and chasing seagulls. <br/>
These are incredible tide flats!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

With the<br/>
&gt; handrail to your back, bear 260 degrees for 15 paces. Did you find <br/>
a bench?<br/>
&gt; From the south end of the bench, head 150 degrees for 30 paces. <br/>
This will<br/>
&gt; take you down a gravel path, over some driftwood and scrambling <br/>
over some<br/>
&gt; boulders.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Find a driftwood log that looks like a bench at 50 degrees. Take a <br/>
seat and<br/>
&gt; enjoy the view of the water. On the right end of the log, by the <br/>
roots,<br/>
&gt; find the letterbox hidden in the tall beach grass.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be very discreet when finding, stamping and re-hiding this <br/>
letterbox. There<br/>
&gt; are condos that are built out into the water that look directly at <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; park. Thank you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is my second letterbox placed. Please let me know what you <br/>
think of it.<br/>
