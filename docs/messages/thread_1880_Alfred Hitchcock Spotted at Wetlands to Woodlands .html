I got a note today (January 25th) from the bluerosegroup that they <br/>
left the Alfred Hitchcock Hitchhiker at the Wetlands to Woodlands <br/>
letterbox in Gabriel Park in Portland, OR!! As many of you know, I <br/>
have been trying to track down my Alfred Hitchcock HH for YEARS!! I <br/>
really would like to have him back. I would like to replant him as a <br/>
permanent letterbox. If ANYONE would be so kind as to run over to <br/>
Gabriel Park and get him for me, I would be SOOO Grateful!! I would <br/>
be happy to reimburse you for the expenses of mailing Alfred to me! <br/>
<br/>
If you find that ALfred has already been removed from the letterbox, <br/>
please try to see who last stamped into the letterbox, so that I <br/>
could try and contact them and get Alfred back!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much! You can read here about the last time I heard from <br/>
Alfred:<br/>

I have been trying to email you all day! Directly from my yahoo <br/>
account and through the yahoo groups and the messages keep getting <br/>
returned to me! With the following message:<br/>
<br/>
Hi. This is the qmail-send program at yahoo.com.<br/>
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following <br/>
addresses.<br/>
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I couldn't find any host named attbi.com. (#5.1.2)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to give you my snail mail address so I can recieve the <br/>
Alfred Hitchcock HH .  I will be happy to reimburse you for<br/>
the cost of Postage etc.<br/>
<br/>
I am so giddy! I can't wait to see him again! Do you have another <br/>
