You've heard how girls are full of spice, <br>
spun sugar are their curls.<br>
Their happy smiles, their love of books,<br>
their skills are `off da hook'<br>
<br>
The Librarians all seem so nice,<br>
how can they be so cruel.<br>
To share a clue on Sunday,<br>
to a place that's closed on Monday.<br>
<br>
This seems to be their only vice,<br>
but they're very naughty girls.<br>
We stayed up late and solved the clue,<br>
and Tuesday claimed the jewel. (woo hoo!)<br>
