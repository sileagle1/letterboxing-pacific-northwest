Anyone know of an area in Southern Washington where ticks can be found? The local Lyme community is trying to pull together several areas to do a tick sweep. The idea is to get as many ticks as possible and test them for tick-borne diseases (TBD). Spring is the best time to do it. We're just not sure what locations to target. Appreciate anything you can share:  where you've seen or gotten ticks, how many, anything.<br/>

We searched for a letterbox on Bateman Island and I remember thinking how it<br/>
seemed like an ideal place for ticks but I didn't want to "go there".<br/>
Thanks Amy!<br/>
I'm keeping all the leads that anyone will share. <br/>
