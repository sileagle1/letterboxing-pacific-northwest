and planted it in the 'Duck in the Park' box in Yuba City, CA 2 days later, It <br/>
traveled to the 'Bridgeport' box in Penn Valley, CA then back to the Yuba City <br/>
area, the 'Sutter Buttes' box, and when Old Blue went to get that box today (I <br/>
with him, having gotten it months ago) we found it again! That's the second <br/>
time we've gotten the same HH twice!! <br/>
<br/>
We had a great boxious day today adding 13 to our count, and have planted <br/>
this HH in a box within a 50 mile range of the Sutter Buttes box, in a box <br/>
originally planted in the winter of 2001!! There's a big hint for anyone who wants <br/>
an HH to add to their collection!<br/>
