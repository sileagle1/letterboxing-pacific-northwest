At Estacada, Sleep Whippet has many boxes in the Timber Park. At least some<br>
of them were there last summer when we went camping.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Maiden - The More The Merrier sounds like great fun.  Knowing<br>
how far up the highway it is helps me - we have one of those huge topo<br>
map books - I'll get my specs out in the morning and see where Fish<br>
Creek Road is.  Have a good weekend.  I'll be on the Springwater this<br>
weekend with my niece, and I'm sure you can guess what we will be<br>
looking for.<br>
