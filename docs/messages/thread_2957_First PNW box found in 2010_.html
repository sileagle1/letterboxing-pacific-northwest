A fine day over here, break in the snow and frigid temps, so I had to get out.  Made a big mistake going after #3 of the Crooked River Ranch Series boxes AFTER Waterfall and ended up climbing up a rock canyon wall in the dark, lost my cell phone, and got pretty dirty, but I did make it home and did find the box, so I guess all is well.  Learned a pretty cheap lesson, it doesn't get dark at 7 pm this time of year (duh), it gets dark much earlier than that.  I'll be spending the morning tomorrow looking for my phone among the rocks in the DAYlight.  Happy New Year to all.<br/>
