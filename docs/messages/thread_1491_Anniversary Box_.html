non-interactive discussion board for unadopted letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Clues follow:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This box was placed in Salt Water State Park in Federal Way and as<br/>
previously discussed, effective Jan. 01, there will be a $5<br/>
admittance fee - so get there quickly to get it free!<br/>
<br/>
Anniversary Box<br/>
Today, December 16, we celebrated our 7th year of wedded bliss! In<br/>
commemoration, we placed a letterbox near one of our favorite<br/>
vistas. We hope you enjoy the spot as much as we do.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Salt Water State Park:<br/>
Take I-5 to Exit 147. Head West on 272nd St. and cross over Pacific<br/>
Highway (aka Hwy 99). Turn right onto 16th Ave. So. Continue to the<br/>
Woodmont Dr. S. light and turn Left onto Woodmont Dr. S. The road<br/>
curves quite a bit and then becomes Marine View Dr. S. Keep to the<br/>
main road until you reach 252nd and turn Left. Turn Left into Salt<br/>
Water State Park and park in the first parking lot on your left.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the Anniversary Box:<br/>
Cross the road from the parking lot on the crosswalk. Take the trail<br/>
to the restrooms. At the restrooms take the trail at about 130.<br/>
Continue on the trail until you pass a large stone chimney on your<br/>
right. Continue on the trail at about 200. Pass under a skinny,<br/>
twisted Madrone arch. Keep the fencing to your left and pause<br/>
occasionally to enjoy the views. The beach is beautiful and on a<br/>
clear day you have majestic views across the water to the Olympics!<br/>
Find a tall Fir on your right sheltering its young one from the salty<br/>
wind. Have a seat on the bench next to the firs and enjoy the<br/>
undulating water, rythmically lapping waves and soft, salty breeze<br/>
some more! Stand between the trees and bench facing about 50 and<br/>
take 9 steps to the 3 ft. stump. The box is there, at its roots,<br/>
snug in a den on the South side, hidden behind some bark and a<br/>
stone. Stamp in, hide it well and then please continue along the<br/>
fence and enjoy the rest of the peaceful scenery. At a hugging fir<br/>
and Pacific Madrone the trail curves away to your right and will lead<br/>
you back to your vehicle.<br/>
This is our 1st completed letterbox - Enjoy!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks! So does this mean it's still there? Does it need adopted? How would I do this? I know this isn't a newbie list so maybe I should ask this there. Thanks for sending me the clues though! Also, we had a great time at the gathering this past weekend. Thanks! And "The Wedding" was BEAUTIFUL!!!!<br/>
