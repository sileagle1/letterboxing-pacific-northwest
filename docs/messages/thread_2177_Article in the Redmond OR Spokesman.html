Just wanted you to know that our little hobby just got a boost here in Central <br>
Oregon. Our local paper interviewed our family and just ran the article in <br>
todays paper.  The writer is also a letterboxer and she did a great job of <br>
describing Letterboxing.   We even planted a box especially for the article, <br>
(Funhogs suggestion), and ran the clues right in the artilce. I was nervous <br>
about how she would present it and I thought she did a great job. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately our little local paper isn't online yet so you won't see it, but trust <br>
me it was great! I'll keep you posted on how many newbies we get!<br>
<br>
Later,<br>

and just planted a box over there last weekend as it happens.  I think <br>
it will be great for those of you there already to get some new blood. <br>

and Birder have been carrying the torch by yourselves <br>
for way too long. You have set the standard high for <br>
beautiful stamps, creative logbooks, interesting clues <br>
and excellent locations. Any new boxers in the area <br>
have great examples to follow. Now, let's sit back and <br>
see what happens (crossing all fingers and toes.) <br>
