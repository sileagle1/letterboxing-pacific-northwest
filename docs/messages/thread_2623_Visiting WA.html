                    <div class="plaintext-content">Try Wally's Chowder House in Des Moines--it isn't terribly far from the <br/>
airport &amp; it's sort of the local secret.  Great seafood (from fish &amp; <br/>
chips all the way to Copper River Salmon when it's in season) and if <br/>
you're lucky and they have blackberry pie, it's incredible!  We've been <br/>
going there for at least a decade now--it's usually our first stop <br/>
after landing at SeaTac!  There are a handful of letterboxes in/around <br/>
the area, too.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Bellevue area, we usually would just hit the Fatburger there <br/>
near Bellevue Square.  Also, there are some great Thai restaurants on <br/>
Mercer Island--77th St Exit off of I-90--the one with which I'm most <br/>
familiar is Thai on Mercer and it's adjacent the Starbucks and Subway <br/>
in a small retail strip--across from Walgreens (if I recall correctly--<br/>
or it might be a QFC?) and across from another street from the Tullys.  <br/>
The chef there is incredible and focuses on healthy but incredibly <br/>
scrumptious Thai cuisine!  Our kids scarfed it down almost as quickly <br/>
as we did!  It's a bit pricey though but well worth the money.<br/>

I grew up in Burien, about 5 minutes from SeaTac (before the "port<br/>
package" you couldn't talk on the phone or hear the TV when the planes<br/>
went by right over our house), so I can recommend a few good<br/>
restaurants in Burien, which'll be pretty close to the airport! ;D<br/>
<br/>
A map: http://maps.citysearch.com/location/10808388?<br/>
You can page through the "nearby businesses" (I started at Azteca) and<br/>
see what else is there. The map shows how close you are to the airport. <br/>

Burien, WA 98166-1423<br/>

6am-10pm/7 days<br/>
American style food with some Pacific Northwest flavors. We've been<br/>
going there, particularly for the potato soup for about oh... 15<br/>
years? 20?<br/>
<br/>
Azteca:<br/>
153 S.W. 157th Street <br/>
Burien, WA 98166<br/>

11am-10pm/Sun-Thur, 11am-11pm/Fri-Sat<br/>
Brilliant (though not *completely* authentic) Mexican food. Don't<br/>
stuff yourself on the free chips and salsa, the meals are ENORMOUS. My<br/>
sister and I used to always half-starve ourselves during the day so we<br/>
could do justice to the dinners at Azteca. You've got to try the<br/>
deep-fried ice cream. We were last there for my Dad's 60th birthday in<br/>
February, they've done some serious remodeling! The restaurant's a<br/>
little tricky to spot, it's sort of behind the Value Village<br/>
(secondhand) store.<br/>

Teriyaki. Tiny little hole-in-the-wall place in a strip of businesses<br/>
next to the Fred Meyer and behind the Jack-in-the-Box. Not exactly a<br/>
dining-in place, though they do have a few tables, but oh, I love<br/>
their teriyaki chicken and the vegetables. Mmmmmm. One of my parents'<br/>
favorite places. Similar advantage to the Ivar's- you'd just go down<br/>
1st Ave to 148th to get on the 518.<br/>

Seafood! I adore the salmon chowder in a bread bowl, but it's all<br/>
great stuff.<br/>
Yes yes, I know, there's Ivar's restaurants all over Seattle and if<br/>
you *really* want the Ivar's experience, you have to visit the one on<br/>
the waterfront, this one's really a quick-stop kind of Ivar's.<br/>
However, this one has the advantage that it's right by the entrance to<br/>
the 518 freeway which goes right past the airport. It's just a little<br/>
west (like less than a block) of 1st Ave, on the south side of 148th. <br/>

sometimes - after a long day of summer hiking we don't think we are <br/>

we just feel like crashing, carry-out is perfect!<br/>
