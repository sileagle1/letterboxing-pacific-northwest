                    <div class="plaintext-content">Try Wally's Chowder House in Des Moines--it isn't terribly far from the <br>
airport & it's sort of the local secret.  Great seafood (from fish & <br>
chips all the way to Copper River Salmon when it's in season) and if <br>
you're lucky and they have blackberry pie, it's incredible!  We've been <br>
going there for at least a decade now--it's usually our first stop <br>
after landing at SeaTac!  There are a handful of letterboxes in/around <br>
the area, too.<br>
<br>
As for the Bellevue area, we usually would just hit the Fatburger there <br>
near Bellevue Square.  Also, there are some great Thai restaurants on <br>
Mercer Island--77th St Exit off of I-90--the one with which I'm most <br>
familiar is Thai on Mercer and it's adjacent the Starbucks and Subway <br>
in a small retail strip--across from Walgreens (if I recall correctly--<br>
or it might be a QFC?) and across from another street from the Tullys.  <br>
The chef there is incredible and focuses on healthy but incredibly <br>
scrumptious Thai cuisine!  Our kids scarfed it down almost as quickly <br>
as we did!  It's a bit pricey though but well worth the money.<br>

I grew up in Burien, about 5 minutes from SeaTac (before the "port<br>
package" you couldn't talk on the phone or hear the TV when the planes<br>
went by right over our house), so I can recommend a few good<br>
restaurants in Burien, which'll be pretty close to the airport! ;D<br>
<br>
A map: http://maps.citysearch.com/location/10808388?<br>
You can page through the "nearby businesses" (I started at Azteca) and<br>
see what else is there. The map shows how close you are to the airport. <br>
<br>
Huckleberry Square:<br>
14423 Ambaum Blvd. S.W.<br>
Burien, WA 98166-1423<br>
206-246-7006 <br>
6am-10pm/7 days<br>
American style food with some Pacific Northwest flavors. We've been<br>
going there, particularly for the potato soup for about oh... 15<br>
years? 20?<br>
<br>
Azteca:<br>
153 S.W. 157th Street <br>
Burien, WA 98166<br>
206-243-2241<br>
11am-10pm/Sun-Thur, 11am-11pm/Fri-Sat<br>
Brilliant (though not *completely* authentic) Mexican food. Don't<br>
stuff yourself on the free chips and salsa, the meals are ENORMOUS. My<br>
sister and I used to always half-starve ourselves during the day so we<br>
could do justice to the dinners at Azteca. You've got to try the<br>
deep-fried ice cream. We were last there for my Dad's 60th birthday in<br>
February, they've done some serious remodeling! The restaurant's a<br>
little tricky to spot, it's sort of behind the Value Village<br>
(secondhand) store.<br>
<br>
Toshi's:<br>
14200 1st Avenue S #F<br>
Burien, WA 98168<br>
206-242-6551<br>
11am-9pm/Mon-Sat<br>
Teriyaki. Tiny little hole-in-the-wall place in a strip of businesses<br>
next to the Fred Meyer and behind the Jack-in-the-Box. Not exactly a<br>
dining-in place, though they do have a few tables, but oh, I love<br>
their teriyaki chicken and the vegetables. Mmmmmm. One of my parents'<br>
favorite places. Similar advantage to the Ivar's- you'd just go down<br>
1st Ave to 148th to get on the 518.<br>
<br>
Ivar's:<br>
125 SW 148TH St Ste D<br>
Burien, WA 98166-1940  <br>
206-242-3281<br>
11am-11pm/7 days<br>
Seafood! I adore the salmon chowder in a bread bowl, but it's all<br>
great stuff.<br>
Yes yes, I know, there's Ivar's restaurants all over Seattle and if<br>
you *really* want the Ivar's experience, you have to visit the one on<br>
the waterfront, this one's really a quick-stop kind of Ivar's.<br>
However, this one has the advantage that it's right by the entrance to<br>
the 518 freeway which goes right past the airport. It's just a little<br>
west (like less than a block) of 1st Ave, on the south side of 148th. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the suggestions!  Carry-out places are a good option for us <br>
sometimes - after a long day of summer hiking we don't think we are <br>
exactly "presentable" for some restaurants.  We'll usually return to <br>
the hotel for a shower and then go back out, but for those times when <br>
we just feel like crashing, carry-out is perfect!<br>
