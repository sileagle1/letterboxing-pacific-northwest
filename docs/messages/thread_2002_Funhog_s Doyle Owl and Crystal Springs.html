Hello,<br>
<br>
I'm from Portland, OR and we are just starting out. We have already<br>
found the Mt Tabor letterbox and I can't be more excited.<br>
<br>
But today was frustrating. We went searching for these two boxes and<br>
could not find them!<br>
<br>
The Doyle Owl: This one is probably our error. We got as far as the<br>
second to last clue and got stuck! We had a great time and ran in to<br>
some interesting people with dogs. Maybe we just need practice. Has<br>
anyone found this one recently?<br>
<br>
Crystal Springs: This one seemed to be nowhere in sight. (or out of<br>
sight). We looked throughout that whole area where the box could have<br>
been. In every little spot. (I don't want to give away too much.) This<br>
one in my mind has to be missing. If anyone has been there before or<br>
has seen it recently, let me know. This trip was also wonderful; we<br>
even found a geo-cash while we were looking! I am assuming the<br>
geo-cash was defintaly different than the box, right? Any thoughts on<br>
this?<br>
<br>
I am determined to find these. So if anyone has and tips on finding<br>
the right spots (in general, not for these particular clues), or has<br>
seen either one of these recently, let me know! We want to go back out<br>
there soon to check it out again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

    Funhog's boxes are not always the easiest to find,<br>
but always worth the effort. :) If the geocash that<br>
you found didn't have a stamp and a log book, it<br>
wasn't the letterbox. You might try e mailing Funhog<br>
to see if you were on the right track.  <br>
<br>
Have Fun!<br>

My boxes difficult to find??? noooooo... These two boxes have challenged many boxers <br>
before you. The one at Crystal Springs is small, if that helps, and has gone missing once <br>
before but the one at Reed has a very secure home and should be in place. I will get out <br>
there and check on these one day soon. <br>

Now if you want to find (or not find, as the case may be) a REALLY evil letterbox, try for <br>
Hidden Dragon. I need to put a letterboxcam on that one. I'm sure the video would be very <br>
amusing.  Funhog<br>

Ha!  I don't think that box really exists.  I've looked for it twice<br>
and there's NO WAY it could still be there.  *shaking head* <br>
Therefore, it must not exist and it's just a cruel, cruel joke.<br>
<br>
Happy trails, though!<br>

Cruel joke it is but not because it's missing! We all know how<br>
annoying it is when someone tells you a box is missing when you KNOW<br>
it isn't. Just ask Brett... it took him three tries and now swears<br>
it's exactly where the clue leads. Heh, Heh, Heh... Funhog<br>

ha ha tee hee,<br>
you are all too funny.<br>
hmm, now for Ryan to say they are difficult!!!!That must mean<br>
something. But then when another after 3 tries can say the clues lead<br>
exactly there.<br>
Well, then you KNOW it must be!!<br>
I must count myself as blessed then having 'found' one of Funhogs, but<br>
then it was an HH and was basically left in our lap. tee hee<br>
guess that doesnt count then.<br>
alas, <br>
one day we may venture again up to Oregon and letterbox. However, my<br>
poor little kiddies have become frsutrated with not finding<br>
letterboxes, they are getting way too content carving and planting.<br>
So for now we end up searching for the easier ones. <br>
