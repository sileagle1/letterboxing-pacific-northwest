Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I'm from Portland, OR and we are just starting out. We have already<br/>
found the Mt Tabor letterbox and I can't be more excited.<br/>
<br/>
But today was frustrating. We went searching for these two boxes and<br/>
could not find them!<br/>
<br/>
The Doyle Owl: This one is probably our error. We got as far as the<br/>
second to last clue and got stuck! We had a great time and ran in to<br/>
some interesting people with dogs. Maybe we just need practice. Has<br/>
anyone found this one recently?<br/>
<br/>
Crystal Springs: This one seemed to be nowhere in sight. (or out of<br/>
sight). We looked throughout that whole area where the box could have<br/>
been. In every little spot. (I don't want to give away too much.) This<br/>
one in my mind has to be missing. If anyone has been there before or<br/>
has seen it recently, let me know. This trip was also wonderful; we<br/>
even found a geo-cash while we were looking! I am assuming the<br/>
geo-cash was defintaly different than the box, right? Any thoughts on<br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
I am determined to find these. So if anyone has and tips on finding<br/>
the right spots (in general, not for these particular clues), or has<br/>
seen either one of these recently, let me know! We want to go back out<br/>
there soon to check it out again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
    Funhog's boxes are not always the easiest to find,<br/>
but always worth the effort. :) If the geocash that<br/>
you found didn't have a stamp and a log book, it<br/>
wasn't the letterbox. You might try e mailing Funhog<br/>
to see if you were on the right track.  <br/>
<br/>
Have Fun!<br/>

My boxes difficult to find??? noooooo... These two boxes have challenged many boxers <br/>
before you. The one at Crystal Springs is small, if that helps, and has gone missing once <br/>
before but the one at Reed has a very secure home and should be in place. I will get out <br/>
there and check on these one day soon. <br/>

Now if you want to find (or not find, as the case may be) a REALLY evil letterbox, try for <br/>
Hidden Dragon. I need to put a letterboxcam on that one. I'm sure the video would be very <br/>

Ha!  I don't think that box really exists.  I've looked for it twice<br/>
and there's NO WAY it could still be there.  *shaking head* <br/>
Therefore, it must not exist and it's just a cruel, cruel joke.<br/>

Happy trails, though!<br/>

Cruel joke it is but not because it's missing! We all know how<br/>
annoying it is when someone tells you a box is missing when you KNOW<br/>
it isn't. Just ask Brett... it took him three tries and now swears<br/>
it's exactly where the clue leads. Heh, Heh, Heh... Funhog<br/>

ha ha tee hee,<br/>
you are all too funny.<br/>
hmm, now for Ryan to say they are difficult!!!!That must mean<br/>
something. But then when another after 3 tries can say the clues lead<br/>
exactly there.<br/>
Well, then you KNOW it must be!!<br/>
I must count myself as blessed then having 'found' one of Funhogs, but<br/>
then it was an HH and was basically left in our lap. tee hee<br/>
guess that doesnt count then.<br/>
alas, <br/>
one day we may venture again up to Oregon and letterbox. However, my<br/>
poor little kiddies have become frsutrated with not finding<br/>
letterboxes, they are getting way too content carving and planting.<br/>
So for now we end up searching for the easier ones. <br/>
