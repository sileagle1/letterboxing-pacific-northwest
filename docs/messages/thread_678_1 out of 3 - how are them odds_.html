                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm new to letterboxing but already very addicted. I've searched for <br>
3 boxes however and only found one. I couldn't find Oxbow #1 - <br>
though according to Funhog I was right on top of the location. Today <br>
my boyfriend and I looked for Der Mad Stamper's Blue Lake box. We <br>
found the "14th hole" and went the 38 paces - we looked all over and <br>
found nada. I did get dry pine needles down my pants and he was <br>
covered in sap and spider webs though (he kinda looked tarred and <br>
feathered)  :-)   <br>
<br>
My question is do I declare the boxes missing - or do I declare <br>
myself a bad letterboxer? 1 out of 3 is kinda discouraging. I need <br>
to go on hunts for boxes I know are still there - that way if I <br>
don't find them I know I'm just not looking hard enough. Any <br>
suggestions would be much appreciated. I'd love to have a few <br>
successes to keep me motivated.<br>
<br>
I'm also planning on placing some boxes soon. Is it better to just <br>
post my clues on this listserve rather than on the main <br>
letterboxing.org site? Sounds like rangers and such patrol the web <br>
sites. <br>
<br>
Any tips for the newbies? Thanks!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Leslie, I had that same experience when I started.  At one point I had <br>
not-found more boxes than I'd found, which it is dang discouraging when you're just <br>
starting out.  Here are some suggestions:<br>
<br>
* E-mail the placer directly, when possible (this is not possible with Der <br>
Mad Stamper) and tell them you couldn't find their box--describe where you <br>
looked so they can tell if you were in the correct spot or not.  If you can't <br>
e-mail the placer, you could e-mail the list and let us know you couldn't find it.  <br>
When you e-mail the list, you want to be very careful not to mention any <br>
"spoilers"--any specific info not already clarified in the clues that might spoil <br>
the hunt for someone who hasn't searched for that box.  Chances are that if <br>
someone knows the box is really still there, they will be more than happy to <br>
gloat about that knowledge ;o).<br>
<br>
*Before you embark on a hunt, check when the box was placed; Der Mad <br>
Stamper's boxes have been there awhile--some are missing.  (A word to the wise: don't <br>
ask why we don't just come up with a system to let people KNOW which boxes are <br>
missing--this is a can of worms you do NOT want to open.  Trust me on this.)  <br>
For now, you might choose to only go after relatively new boxes--happily, <br>
there are a ton of them.<br>
<br>
*Search the archives (main list and PNW) to see when was the last time <br>
someone mentioned finding a particular box.  The Blue Lake box, for example, was <br>
recently mentioned as missing.<br>
<br>
As for posting, most people list boxes on the LBNA site.  While letterboxing <br>
is not welcome in national parks, most other places haven't even heard of this <br>
odd little hobby, so we're currently under the radar screen.  And of course, <br>
you could always approach the staff of a place and check that it's alright to <br>
plant in that particular place.  I've been pleasantly surprised to find that <br>
some places welcome Lbing, once I've explained it to them.  People often <br>
announce/include the clues on this or the main list, but usually this is not the <br>
only place where they are mentioned, since anyone who doesn't happen to read that <br>
message (or someone who joins in the game later) would not know your box was <br>
out there.<br>
<br>
Don't worry--soon you'll actually find more boxes than you don't find!<br>
