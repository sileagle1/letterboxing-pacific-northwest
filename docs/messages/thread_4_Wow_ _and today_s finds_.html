Look, fellow PNW-LBers, at the wide open spaces Generalissimo Ryan has <br>
led us to! Elbow room! Space to breathe! Open horizons as far as the <br>
eye can see! Why, this is the kind of place where a person could carve <br>
out a homestead!!! <br>
<br>
Or where a person could report finding these two boxes this aft:<br>
<br>
Funhog's Bishop's Close--Whadda nice, peaceful little garden. I had no <br>
idea it existed. Rough-skinned newts are happily mating in the ponds <br>
(at least I assume they were happy--it looked like they were smiling <br>
to me!).<br>
<br>
Der Mad Stamper's #2 at Tryon Creek State Park (Bird Watcher)--my <br>
fellow LBing mom and I have four kids between us, and with the young <br>
'uns in tow, it's taken us awhile to get all in this series.  But <br>
we've finally done it! I can report that as of March 2003 all 4 of Der <br>
Mad Stamper's and also Wendy's Orphan are alive and well at Tryon. <br>
<br>
Happy to be here!<br>

*laughing*  Okay, but don't make me move this board to the adult-only <br>
area on Yahoo.  ;o)<br>
<br>
As cute as newts are--I always hate when they come out in force <br>
because I'm always afraid I'm going to step on them if I'm not <br>
careful.  They do a splended job of moving right in front of my foot!<br>
<br>
Although if there's one thing I hate stepping on even more than a <br>
newt--it's those banana slugs.  *shudder*  You know that scene in the <br>
latest Harry Potter when Ron starts spitting out slugs?  I still have <br>
nightmares over that.  Can't believe they call that a kids movie.  <br>
*rolling eyes*<br>
<br>
*sigh*  I miss the hikes in the Pacific Northwest.  But I will return!<br>
