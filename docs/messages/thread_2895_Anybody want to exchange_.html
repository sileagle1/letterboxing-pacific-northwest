Hi Sally, and welcome to Oregon.  I was in California recently and<br/>
enjoyed my time there finding a couple of interesting boxes.  The<br/>
person I was with was not a boxer so I was hampered a bit, but it's so<br/>
beautiful there this time of year.  DoubleTree and I will be leaving<br/>
my house at 9 am Sunday morning for a day of boxing and would be happy<br/>
to meet with you somewhere between my house (NE 131st and Glisan<br/>
Street) and McMinnville if you want to.  I'm speaking for her, but I'm<br/>
sure she would agree meeting someone from California would be<br/>
wonderful.  That said, usually when anyone comes from out of town it<br/>
is just the excuse several of our local boxers look for to arrange a<br/>
party, and if that happens I'll be there.  Perhaps you would prefer a<br/>
spur-of-the-moment gathering at McMenamin's in Troutdale or elsewhere<br/>
in Portland?  If you name a place and time Friday or Saturday evening,<br/>
I can guarantee you I and many others will be there - we are party<br/>
animals here in Portland and any excuse will do.  I only mention<br/>
McMenamin's because we meet there fairly often and everybody likes it.<br/>
 There is also a pub in NE Portland I can't remember the name of,<br/>
Hollywood District, and also a pub called the Brass Horse Pub where we<br/>
have all met before, both nice places that I think allow children<br/>
inside.  Let us know and we will get together one way or another.  If<br/>
you only want to meet up with DoubleTree and I, e-mail me at<br/>
gilbe@comcast.net, I practically sit on my computer all day because of<br/>
my work, and I will answer you right away with my phone number. <br/>

Jessa, an exchange is where letterboxers meet up and exchange the<br/>
stamps they carry with them all the time.  These are called signature<br/>
stamps.  An exchange can be as simple as running into another<br/>
letterboxer on the trail and exchanging stamps, or as involved as what<br/>
we usually call an "event" where more than two people are meeting up -<br/>
events can be single-day affairs or things that take place over<br/>
several days involving camping or staying overnight somewhere - the<br/>
possibilities are endless.  At an event there is usually an event<br/>
stamp that everyone gets to put in their log book as well as the<br/>
signature stamps from the other people in attendance.  Like Maiden<br/>
said, Portland boxers are ALWAYS up for an exchange or and event,<br/>
whatever it ends up being called.  It's a great way to find out what<br/>
the other letterboxers in your area are doing or meet people when you<br/>
are from out of town.<br/>

Great... how about if we meet at the Horse Brass Pub at 9:30am? Calli <br/>
suggested it as one of the places you all have met before. I looked <br/>
it up online. The one I find is the one at 4534 SE Belmont in <br/>
Portland. So I'll be there at 9:30am. I have to leave to the airport <br/>
about 10:15am. <br/>
<br/>
I'm so excited!!<br/>
