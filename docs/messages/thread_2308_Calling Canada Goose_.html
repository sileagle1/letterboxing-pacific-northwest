<br/>
It's been ages since I posted to this board - not since we left <br/>
Northern CA, in fact. Though, we have relatives in Vancouver, BC who <br/>
have just started to box...hmmm, Mrs Jiggs is already muttering about <br/>
a "road trip" lol!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know or know of Canada Goose, who used to box around your <br/>
neck of the woods a few years ago?<br/>
<br/>
we're trying to contact her about some Canadian boxes she planted <br/>
years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Pete aka Jiggs<br/>

Are you referring to the Clown series she planted in Ft. Stelicoom?  If <br/>
so, we've mainly taken care of those for her.<br/>
