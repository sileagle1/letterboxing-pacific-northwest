                    <div class="plaintext-content"> The entire Happy Postman Series is alive and well. I did have some <br/>
reports on the landscape changing though. It seems that the Jolly <br/>
Green Giant had somewhat of a cold the other day while out visiting <br/>
with friends and sneezed in the direction of the Three Bears home and <br/>
knocked down one of the knotty trees. He then proceeded to visit with <br/>
Cinderella and while standing at the front gate of her castle, yes <br/>
you guest it, had another of his sneezing fits and damaged the <br/>
beautiful "H" that adorned the front gate. The royal repair men were <br/>
unable to repair the damage to the castle's front gate and Cinderella <br/>
refuses to vacate the castle so be aware of the damage. The three <br/>
bears have no intention of moving from their happy home. If they did <br/>
then where would Goldilocks go for porridge?<br/>
