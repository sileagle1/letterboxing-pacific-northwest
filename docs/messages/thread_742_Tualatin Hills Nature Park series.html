As I recall, 2 &4 were alive and well (and very nicely carved!!), those on <br>
the Oak Trail (3 & 8, I think) were questionable because the trail was under <br>
water and no one had been able to get to them to check, 1 was surely missing, and <br>
6 & 7 seemed to have disappeared too.  I never felt like I found the correct <br>

We'll help you maintain & replace these boxes.  Give us a call if you <br>
want to discuss/strategize.<br>

I have heard of others placing boxes in this park and they get <br>
pulled immediately.  I am thinking the rangers keep a close eye on <br>
these things, they probly don't want them to be replaced.  It is a <br>
shame, we love to walk there.<br>

Actually, I spoke to a ranger while I was there.  She was aware of the boxes, <br>
and it wasn't a problem (as I recall) because the placer had cleared placing <br>
them in the park.  I think they could be replaced w/o problem, but it would <br>
probably be a good idea to talk to the staff there first.  Who was the original <br>
placer?  Thom?  I don't believe he's currently active in boxing, so I'd say <br>
the Tualatin series is ripe for adoption/replacement.<br>
