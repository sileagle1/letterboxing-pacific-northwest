Halloo to All,<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to get a little help regarding a box DMS placed somewhat <br/>
near me back in 2000. (And thanks, Mitch, BTW, for doing that recent <br/>
interview with Mark. I really enjoyed learning more about you and <br/>
about the hobby. Especially here in the PNW.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, about a month ago I sent out a request on the main talk list <br/>
to ask if this box was still active. (I didn't realize DMS wasn't <br/>
active at the time. =) I did receive a reply from someone who said <br/>
they had found the box in 2003, and it was safe and sound. I figured <br/>
it was worth a shot and headed out to find a couple boxes yesterday <br/>
afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
I was completely skunked by the clues to "The Raptor" letterbox - I <br/>
walked them through completely twice(just paces and compass <br/>
bearings), and my ending points were at least 50 feet apart. Neither <br/>
place looked to have a prime spot for placing a letterbox. So, I <br/>
have no doubt it was my interpretation of the clues giving me fits. <br/>
I WAS carrying my 15-month-old and trying to watch for snakes and <br/>
gopher holes (both of which I found!) This no doubt made my paces <br/>
uneven and I had trouble finding enough landmarks to make sure I was <br/>
keeping the correct bearing in the first place. I think this is one <br/>
I need to do with a partner.<br/>
<br/>
After all this preamble, I'll get to my question...=) Could someone <br/>
who knows about this box please email me offlist and cofirm for me <br/>
whether or not I was in the correct area? I don't want any <br/>
additional clues, but I do need to know if the box is beyond the <br/>
barbed-wire fence as that area is off-limits to foot traffic at this <br/>
time. You CAN get back there through gates, but they are trying to <br/>
preserve that area for native plants and I don't feel right tromping <br/>
out there just because *I* have a good reason. =) I did find one set <br/>
of rather distinctive rocks I felt could be near the hiding place. <br/>
If I'm warm, I'd appreciate some confirmation. I'll just put it on <br/>
my list to check in another 6 months or so. If that doesn't sound <br/>
right, I'll just keep looking! But, I'll take a baby tender next <br/>
time. =)<br/>

Dear Grifos,<br/>
<br/>
I hope you'll forgive me for answering you on the list, rather than <br/>
in private.  If I'm going to share info with you, I might as well <br/>
share with everyone....<br/>
<br/>
No, the Raptor letterbox is not beyond the fence in the protected <br/>
area.  Nor is it at a set of distinctive rocks.  As far as I know, <br/>
the box is still alive and well.  Please confirm, if you find it.  <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, look out for those snakes and gophers!<br/>

I have the information I need now - I am sure it was safe as of August '03 and not directing anyone into off-limits areas. (Though perhaps a "nearby" geocache is doing so.) I still have NO idea where it is exactly - thanks to everyone for being very careful about your replies - but at least I know I can continue searching without feeling like the grass is greener over there.... I will have to get sneakier myself as, believe it or not, there were actually other visitors way out there on a weekday afternoon. I can just see trying to explain, "Ummm, a raptor! Yes! I'm sure I saw a raptor bearing 280 degrees for 39 paces toward that, um, animal lair thingy. Yeah, it WAS walking...."<br/>

This is fun! Though maybe I need to start selling things on ebay to support the gas bill for my habit. =)<br/>

Set out looking for this box again about a week after this reply from Der Mad Stamper. (Thanks BTW!) I went with my mom and baby this time, and proceeded to pace around from the same starting point as before. Predictably, we ended up at slightly different end points, but still didn't have any luck finding the box, or really even a spot that looked appropriate to look "deeper."<br/>
<br/>
So, we decided to take a walk further down the way and take some pictures of the canyon that I had skipped before b/c I ran out of time. Ummm, words cannot express just how dumb I felt when I put 2 and 2 together and realized I was starting from ENTIRELY the wrong spot. Erg! I don't think I can fully communicate my moment of duh-ness without possibly giving away a clue, but suffice to say, when you're SURE you've found the correct starting point, you might want to think again. =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, starting from what I now THINK was the correct place, we came to "a crossing" precisely where indicated, as well as an "animal lair" at the stated number of paces. We must have the same pace size DMS, because those bearings and paces worked out perfectly. However, we STILL did not find the box. =) We were up to our armpits in the location we felt was correct (after checking well for friendlies and not-so-friendlies), but no luck. We also covered about a 30 foot circle around the location with similar results. We never did find the geocache that many had mentioned either, so perhaps we were still not in the correct location. (Though we did find some scattered poker chips...McToys?) But, I'm getting a GPSr for Christmas, so perhaps I can try finding the cache, THEN the LB. =) It will probably be spring before we get out there again though. Unless I just can't stand the failure all winter...this is one of only two boxes that have skunked me so far! =)<br/>
<br/>
So thanks DMS, for a lot of fun, a needed lesson, and some good views. We went on up the way and found Swan Falls Dam, Boulder Graveyard, and Water the Eagle, so we did come away with some stamps. We only found out the REALLY good news a few days later when we discovered that taking so long to look for the Raptor meant we didn't end up being the ones who found the human remains up at the top of Initial Point - which, but for the darkness, would have been our last stop for a LB on the way home. Some "photographers" found skeletal remains of two bodies up there on Halloween. They were described as hidden in a "cache" and there for a few months, so I think the finders just may have been geocachers looking into crevices...just like we would have been. Ewww! SO glad my toddler wasn't the one to come up on those!<br/>
<br/>
Well congratulations if you made it to the end of my novel! I don't post much, so I guess it all comes out at once! =)<br/>

<br/>
We arrived at the location just before dusk, and scrambled to follow <br/>
the clues to the supposed spot where the box could be found.  I <br/>
poked and prodded in all the obvious holes and such, to no luck.<br/>
<br/>
After the sun set my wife rewalked the clues with flashlight in hand <br/>
and standing above what just had to be the spot, asked me again if <br/>
I'd checked out all the obvious hiding spots visible to the eye.  I <br/>
swore to her I had, but donned my glove again and gave it another <br/>
go.  Well, wouldn't you know it, the back wall I had previously felt <br/>
with my fingers on my first prod suddenly moved when pushed on from <br/>
the side, and behind it lay the treasure we sought.<br/>
<br/>
Another very clever hiding spot from the master letterboxer "Der Mad <br/>
Stamper" himself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was there back in September of 2001, but who knows if it <br/>
is still there today.<br/>
<br/>
If you have specific questions about the right location of the box, <br/>
you can ask me, although, I won't give the exact location away but <br/>
will tell you if you are in the correct vacinity or not.  :o)   Use <br/>
my email addy to contact me.<br/>

Happy Letterboxing!<br/>

someone <br/>

for me <br/>
&gt;   &gt; whether or not I was in the correct area? I don't want any <br/>
&gt;   &gt; additional clues, but I do need to know if the box is beyond <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; barbed-wire fence as that area is off-limits to foot traffic <br/>
at <br/>
&gt;   this <br/>
&gt;   &gt; time. You CAN get back there through gates, but they are <br/>
trying to <br/>
&gt;   &gt; preserve that area for native plants and I don't feel right <br/>
&gt;   tromping <br/>
&gt;   &gt; out there just because *I* have a good reason. =) I did find <br/>
one <br/>
&gt;   set <br/>
&gt;   &gt; of rather distinctive rocks I felt could be near the hiding <br/>
place. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; If I'm warm, I'd appreciate some confirmation. I'll just put <br/>
it on <br/>
&gt;   &gt; my list to check in another 6 months or so. If that doesn't <br/>
sound <br/>
&gt;   &gt; right, I'll just keep looking! But, I'll take a baby tender <br/>
next <br/>
&gt;   &gt; time. =)<br/>

&gt;   Dear Grifos,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I hope you'll forgive me for answering you on the list, rather <br/>
than <br/>
&gt;   in private.  If I'm going to share info with you, I might as <br/>
well <br/>
&gt;   share with everyone....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   No, the Raptor letterbox is not beyond the fence in the <br/>
protected <br/>
&gt;   area.  Nor is it at a set of distinctive rocks.  As far as I <br/>
know, <br/>
&gt;   the box is still alive and well.  Please confirm, if you find <br/>
it.  <br/>
&gt;   Thanks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   By the way, look out for those snakes and gophers!<br/>
