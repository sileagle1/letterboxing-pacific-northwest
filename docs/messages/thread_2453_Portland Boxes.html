I'll be going one direction via Seattle to/from my home on Whidbey Island <br/>

And I would SO be into a mini-gathering.  I don't know what the workshop <br/>

the evenings, or else the Sunday that I leave, since we'll be clearing out <br/>
early and I'm in no rush to get back.  It's the first Friday-Sunday in <br/>
August.<br/>

&gt; Can you tell us which way you will be traveling? It might help to<br/>
&gt; make recommendations. Would you be up for a mini gathering with some<br/>
&gt; of us in the SW WA and Portland areas?<br/>
