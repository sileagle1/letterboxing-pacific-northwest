boxes at Trillium lake probably won't survive the winter snow <br>
pack.... Since the park and campground are now closed for the season <br>
DH and I are headed up that way today to pull them for the season.  I <br>
will replace them in the spring when the snow melts!  I hope no one <br>
was planning to get them today or soon.  There will always be next <br>
spring!    Wingnut<br>
