                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've finally been able to get out and do some boxing in the last couple of<br>
weeks.  I'm finding a lot of VERY lonely boxes; some with no visitors in<br>
more than a year!  Just thought I'd give you a run down of what I've found:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Great Outdoors #6 - all 3 in good condition<br>
<br>
Great Outdoors #5 - both there and healthy<br>
<br>
Great Outdoors #2 - there and fine<br>
<br>
Companions - alive and well, but VERY lonely!  This is an awesome stamp, so<br>
you should all rush out there and get it.<br>
<br>
Robin Hood Festival #1 - no luck finding this one.  Anyone seen it recently?<br>
<br>
Robin Hood Festival #2 - box is in place with only the stamp, no log book<br>
<br>
Jump Dog - alive and well.  Also a VERY nice stamp.<br>
<br>
To the Bat Cave - no box there.  I'm sure I was in the right place, so it<br>
may be missing.  Anyone have an update?<br>
<br>
Who Loves Lasagna? - alive and well.  Watch out for the car key eating<br>
rocks!!!!<br>
<br>
Circus Memories #4 - alive and well (didn't check the other boxes in this<br>
series because I already had them)<br>
<br>
Three Firs - this box is definitely gone.<br>
<br>
Painters Palette - alive and well<br>
<br>
Series of the Elements - all alive and well (a nice series, too)<br>
<br>
Care Bear Stare - Found 4 out of 5.  I imagine the 5th one is there, but I<br>
ran out of time to look for it.<br>
<br>
Life Cycle of the Butterfly - Boxes 2 & 3 are there.  1 and 4 are confirmed<br>
missing.<br>
<br>
Club Tahlequlah - alive and well (fun clues, too!)<br>
<br>
Jerry Garcia Tree- alive and well<br>
<br>
Family Forest Letterbox Series - Found 1 & 2 alive and well, but ran out of<br>
time for box 3.  This is an awesome place!  These boxes have had very few<br>
visitors in their life time.  You are all missing out if you don't go find<br>
them!<br>
<br>
Letterboox - An AMAZING stamp.  You must go get this one too.<br>
<br>
First Shoe Tied - alive and well<br>
<br>
Colaptus Curatus - alive and well<br>
<br>
Favorite Hat - alive and well<br>
<br>
Anna's Hummingbirds - #1 is there, couldn't find 2 or 3 (I think 3 is<br>
missing), and ran out of time for the rest.<br>
<br>
What's for Dinner - Didn't find #1, found #2, ran out of time for the rest<br>
<br>
Who Let the Dogs Out? - Great series, all alive and well<br>
<br>
Musician's Series - all alive and well<br>
<br>
U-2 - alive and well<br>
<br>
Johnny Lang - alive and well<br>
<br>
Texas Star - alive and well<br>
<br>
The Pearl - alive and well<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have a couple that are on my list to do this week that I wanted to see if<br>
I can get an update on.  With all the rain and the flooding we had in<br>
January & February does anyone know the status of Adele, Quackers, Smith &<br>
Bybee Turtles and any others that are close to water?<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Anyone else have boxes to report on?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've hit a bunch of the ones you have as well. I also have found a few<br>
others lately. I attempted Robin Hood #1 a while ago, but couldn't come<br>
close to finding it. We found the pile, but no box. <br>
 <br>
Smith and Bybee Turtles I attempted during the flooding, but as we pulled<br>
into the driveway all you could see was the TOP of the trees. The rest were<br>
under water. My suspicion is this box is missing, but I haven't been down<br>
there to look. <br>
 <br>
I took a quick peek at the Tualatin Crawdad box. No go on that one. I'm<br>
pretty sure it's gone. <br>

rain stopped and I reburied her . . . so as of a few weeks ago she was all<br>
well.  I wasn't able to find Quackers in the fall and when I emailed hte<br>
placer I was told I was in the right spot - it should've been high enough to<br>
survive the rain - let me know if you can locate it (it doesn't show any<br>
activity on the databases).  The Oaks bottom box is around the corner, but<br>
the trail was closed due to landslide last time I was down there (3 - 4<br>
weeks?) so check on that one too.  Oh, and if you haven't visited it yet go<br>
right up the hill from Adele to visit Sophie (her mom).<br>
<br>
Why not just shoot me an emial when your in my neighborhood and my daughter<br>
and I can check 'em out too!<br>
