Silver Eagle's Klondike Goldrush was alive & well today.  We rushed <br>
up North, tools in hand, to find our outfitters & the first stop in <br>
our trek.  Major, major maple leaf drop in the area.  Took trudging <br>
through about a 2' deep compacted layer of 'em fallen leaves before <br>
we struck paydirt...then it was pickaxes over shovels, then shovels <br>
over pickaxes until we feverishly found what we were seekin'--the <br>
gold we found at the end of the hunt was well worth the forage!!!  <br>
No foolin'!!!<br>
<br>
Also, WoW & Secret were both alive & well and awaiting visitors.<br>
