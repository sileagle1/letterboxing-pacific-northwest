two years back. The hole it was hidden in had grown so much that it<br/>
was nearly impossible to extricate it way back then and the logbook<br/>
was totally saturated with water. That box taught me not to use<br/>
"bowls" in trees as hiding places. Regardless, the view from up there<br/>
is always worth the trek. Funhog<br/>
