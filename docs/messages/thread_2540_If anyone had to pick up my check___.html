forgotten to pay for my order - if anyone got stuck with it somehow,<br>
please let me know.  I think the bartender probably just forgot to<br>
give it to me, or it got left on the bar and I never picked it up.  I<br>
never saw a bill.  I'm sending $10 to the establishment Monday unless<br>
I hear that someone else took care of this by chance.  Thought maybe<br>
that the last people to leave might have gotten questioned about it.<br>
