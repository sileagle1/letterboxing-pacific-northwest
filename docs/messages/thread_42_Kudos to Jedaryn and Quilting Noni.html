decided to check up on the Dancing at Bougival Box.  It is still <br>
well hidden and nice and dry on the inside.  Checked the log <br>
book and found that Jedaryn and Quilting Noni had paid a visit.  <br>
Very nice comments from both ladies.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
I also saw that you both had made an impromtu visit to a certain <br>
geocache nearby.  I think that you had visited that specific <br>
location once before on another 'Adventure'.  ;0)  Funny how we <br>
cant help but to look again in a place where we have once <br>
visited.  The cache is still there, even though I had warned the <br>
owner of previous tom foolery in that location.  I read the log and <br>
saw that a letterboxer had found it by mere chance and I <br>
chuckled.  That was not mere chance, that was taking a second <br>
look at an old treasure trove!   I thought it was kind of funny.<br>
<br>
Great to see that you have been out there.  Hope to meet you <br>
someday on the trails.<br>
