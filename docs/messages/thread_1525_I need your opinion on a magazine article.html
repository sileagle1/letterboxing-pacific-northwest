I am a rubber stamper.  Once, many years ago, a RS magazine did an <br>
article on Dartmouth moor & letterboxing.<br>
<br>
A friend in my RS club thought it was great and wanted us to find <br>
some way of getting it going in the US.  (Course we didn't.)<br>

Fast forward to now.  A RS mag I just got had "The Letterboxer's <br>

<br>
I was wondering if I should write an article for the mag about LBing <br>
in the US and the guidelines to know before starting this hobby.  You <br>
know the ones, always hide the box where you found it, make sure no <br>
one can see it, etc.<br>
<br>
The magazine, RubberStampMadness, employs my best friend since 7th <br>
grade, so if the article would be heavily edited, I would know and <br>
have a say.<br>
<br>
What do you think?  Should I write the article from a rubber <br>
stamper's view?  This is a limited audience, so it won't be like <br>
Newsweek or Time.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you think I should write the article and what <br>
you think should DEFINITELY be in the article if I did.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I was just recently interviewed by a reporter for a small town <br>
newspaper in Camas, WA. and I made sure that I emphasized the need to <br>
keep the surrounding areas as pristine as you found it and to use all <br>
natural materials found in the immediate area to cover and hide your <br>
letterbox. Also when placing and finding a box, make sure that you do <br>
not trample through bushes, plants, trees or anything else for that <br>
matter that would endanger or damage the surrounding areas. <br>
Letterboxers are not just out there to find a letterbox but to also <br>
enjoy the beauty of nature and to preserve it as well if it means to <br>
bring along a garbage bag and pick up litter as you go. If you are <br>
interested in more information to give to the article and you are in <br>
the area, please stop by the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp at <br>
Battle Ground Lake on August 27-29 and listen to Iron Bear as he <br>
gives you all the information you will ever need on letterboxing <br>
etiquette. Hope to see you there!<br>
