little crazy.  When the planters are a couple of my favs, well, <br>
there's not much that will hold me back, including the good sense <br>
that God gave me, apparently.  <br>
<br>
Sunday night found us eastbound heading across the Columbia River <br>
near Vantage.  The Wild Horse Monument (with a new letterbox) is at <br>
the top of the hill and even though the light was fading, we decided <br>
to make a quick stop and nab the box.  It is a short but steep climb <br>
up to the horses and once you get up there, the view is stunning.  <br>
Climbing up wasn't too bad.  It was the getting down that was going <br>
to be a problem, my particular assortment of fused and titanium <br>
joints plus an healthy fear of heights means I should stay on flat <br>
terrain.  But, I didn't.<br>
<br>
While I was happily stamping away, Doug was trying to figure out how <br>
best to get us down in one piece.  There was a faint path of tire <br>
tracks leading away from the parking lot below and another set of <br>
tracks on top not far from the horses.   Who knew if it was the <br>
same 'road?'  So against the collective advise of the other trekkers <br>
on top, Doug clambered down and jumped into the Chevy truck. He <br>
crawled around the hills and through the gullies until we could only <br>
see the brake lights.  Then he disappeared. About that time the <br>
mildly interested tourists decided it was getting dark and time to <br>
get back on the road.  I waited up there alone another half hour or <br>
so while it got darker and windy. Suddenly I could see headlights!  <br>
He was a long way off, but he was getting closer!  When he drove up <br>
I don't know who was happier, Doug, the rescuer or colls, the <br>
rescued. And there we were, a 50ish+ couple on an adventure, bumping <br>
along a 4x4 track under the moonlight, escaping fate.  <br>
<br>
I'm betting we've all got 'em, letterboxing stories probably better <br>
left untold where the thrill, challenge, or maybe just plain <br>
stubbornness trumps common sense.  <br>
<br>
PP & FL, wanna a ride?  DB wants to go again.  And, thanks Mike & <br>
Elaine, another excellent box as always.<br>
