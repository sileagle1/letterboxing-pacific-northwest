June 04, 2005<br/>
11 a.m. to 5 p.m.<br/>
Olympia, WA, USA<br/>
<br/>
Come celebrate Priest Point Park's 100th Birthday! Enjoy a day of<br/>
history, nature, performances, food, games and education in June.<br/>
Special features include a Living Room History Project, guided nature<br/>
hikes and bird counts, a salmon bake, fiary house parade of homes and<br/>
letterboxing for all ages. Come have fun commemorating the gem of<br/>
Olympia's park system.<br/>
<br/>
More info: Priest Point Park is a 314 acre City of Olympia park with a<br/>
mixture of mature coniferous and deciduous woods and lush understory.<br/>
The park includes an extensive trail system, one mile of waterfront<br/>
with access to a rocky beach, mudflats, a number of picnic areas, and<br/>
restrooms. Some of the best birding is on the west side of the park.<br/>
<br/>
Directions<br/>
To reach Priest Point Park, take exit 105B from I-5. Follow Plum<br/>
Street north. Continue past 4th Avenue. Plum Street becomes East Bay<br/>

Inlet. After about 2 miles you will reach Priest Point Park on East<br/>
Bay Drive. Note: For the event shuttles will be provided as parking<br/>
will be closed off at the park. If you need more info about where to<br/>
catch a shuttle (free) you can either drop me a note or contact<br/>

Unfortunately, will be working from 10 to 4 then uploading bridge results<br/>
until 6 or so.  Wanted to attend, even without the boxes, but have to miss<br/>
the event. <br/>
<br/>
How soon until the new boxes have their clues available to the<br/>
nonattendees??<br/>
<br/>
Possibly a mini-gathering in the near future to take advantage of this<br/>
opportunity??<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">After all the logbook making, stamp carving, trail exploring, clue<br/>
writing....the boxes are staying in the park. The clues will post on<br/>
the main website either tomorrow (Saturday) or Sunday. Once they<br/>
disappear I will either delete them or re-do them depending on the<br/>
alignment of the planets, the biorythms of my Labrador and how well<br/>
the stock market is faring...<br/>
<br/>
I would be honored if people wanted to do a mini gathering there to<br/>
find the boxes. The boxes will take a decent amount of time to find;<br/>
not because of the clues (which are fairly straighforward) but because<br/>
of the size of the park. It really is a fantastic park. You can time<br/>
it for low tide and beach comb a little bit, cool off on the forest<br/>
trails and plan an outdoor picnic at the playground if you choose. It<br/>
is a beautiful sunset spot.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some people can make it. The fairy house parade of homes will<br/>
also be fun and people are invited to create their own fairy houses in<br/>
the park as well. If you can't be there for the celebration and visit<br/>
later on, keep your eyes open for fairy houses throughout the park.<br/>
History has it, the park was once a thriving fairy settlement. The<br/>
fairy and gnome population dwindled as development encroached. The<br/>
City of Olympia hopes to invite the little forest guardians to return<br/>
with small fairy houses hidden throughout the park. If you build<br/>
it...they will come. ;)<br/>
