are a lot of Church goers in the group, so not sure if Sundays would <br/>
work, it's really up to everyone.  Would ppl be staying in motels in <br/>
the area, then it could go both days????????  Also this is getting <br/>
into deer hunting season, I know lots are against it, and lots are <br/>
for it..... But... some areas along the coast might not be well <br/>
served for letterboxers trapesing around with gun bearing hunters in <br/>
the midst. (for those planning on getting in on a bit of the local <br/>
boxing too!) I guess it comes down to if ya can make it you can and <br/>
if not ya can't?  I will check into the park reservations tomorrow <br/>
and see what works for them.  Glad to see everytone is so enthused, <br/>
don't wanna burn you all out on get togethers!   Wingnut<br/>

(It is still up in the air)--That is the first weekend of Oct. Later <br/>
weekends might be more doable for him, but of course I can't promise <br/>
anything until he actually finishes at Katahdin!! :-)<br/>
