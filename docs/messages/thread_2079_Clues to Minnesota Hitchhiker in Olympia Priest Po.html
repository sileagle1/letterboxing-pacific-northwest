<br>
I am only posting the clues to this hitchhiker on this site. This<br>
hitchiker was picked up in MN when I was there for my brother's<br>
funeral. It is ironically called the "Good Luck Hitchhiker"...Sigh.<br>
(Bet you're all wondering how it was I came to find a hitchhiker in MN<br>
while there for such a hard time. It was in a box I planted just a<br>
skip from my sister's back door. I took a little stroll for some<br>
breathing time and checked on it.) The hitchhiker itself is not inside<br>
a letterbox because I wanted a seasoned letterboxer to find it.<br>
However, the starting point is one of the boxes in the park-<br>
<br>
Good Luck Hitchhiker:<br>
Head West from the Swamp Gnome. When your footsteps crunch (but before<br>
they slurp) turn north. Find the breaker wall. There is a fallen tree<br>
that crosses it about 6-8 feet from where you encounter the wall. The<br>
tree is covered in ivy. Approach the tree from the south, step up and<br>
reach around in the ivy on the top of the trunk until you find the<br>
hitchhiker. It is double bagged. When you find it, would you mind<br>
letting dropping me a line? That way I won't wonder if I need to check<br>
on it over time.<br>
<br>
Regards~ Kristi<br>

Ps. Am I the only one needing a leg up on the 7 legged gig at Priest<br>
Point? Probably... <br>
