&gt;<br/>
&gt;From what I have heard, there is a game played in England, particularly in<br/>
&gt;Dartmoor National Park, bearing a faint resemblance to the<br/>
&gt;hobby we call letterboxing.  It is called...  letterboxing!  Seeing as how<br/>
it has<br/>
&gt;actually been around for over a hundred years, technically it<br/>
&gt;is "the original."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It's this type of tongue in cheek that many on this list seem to take as a<br/>
sarcastic tone of voice.  Most everyone should know that this hobby came<br/>
from Dartmoor, if they don't then I'm sure that someone will point it out to<br/>
them in a less tongue in cheek manner.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The primary difference is the mystique.  In the crusty, dusty old rendition<br/>
of<br/>
&gt;the game, just getting your hands on clues to letterboxes was<br/>
&gt;often challenging.  Deciphering the sparse, cryptic notations once you did<br/>
get<br/>
&gt;them, was rarely as easy as 1-2-3, and even after spending<br/>
&gt;weeks/months/years solving a clue, one may journey considerable distance<br/>
&gt;to the location and find the box no longer in existance.  But in<br/>
&gt;such instance, where a player has put significant effort into solving the<br/>
clue,<br/>
&gt;there is still a great satisfaction, even though there is no box.<br/>
&gt;The reward in this game is mastering the challenge, not necessarily the<br/>
stamp<br/>
&gt;in the log book.  In this version of the game, there is a<br/>
&gt;respect for other players, particularly those who have been playing the<br/>
game<br/>
&gt;for a while (I guess these would be those that are known<br/>
&gt;today as "oldies").  I know, you are thinking...  say it isn't so, but it<br/>
is!<br/>
<br/>
I've one simple question here, asked in all humility and deference... how<br/>
does one master the challenge if they can not locate the end, or the prize,<br/>
or at least a sign that they have in fact, mastered the challenge?  By the<br/>
simple fact that they assume they were correct in the translation?  If<br/>
that's so, then I get the gold and silver buried at the Desprado in the west<br/>
somewhere becuase I think I've gotten that muystery all figured out.  Oh,<br/>
wait... That's right... If I do figure it out, I DO get all the gold and<br/>
silver buried there.  Here, if someone or something vandalizes a box and I<br/>
drive 3+ hours, as I will be this Wed, to get to the location, that's too<br/>
bad, it's all a part of the sport, right?  3 hours of wear and tear on my<br/>
car, the gas and food I speant money on to get there and all for what? So I<br/>
could prove I was able to decipher the clues correctly, I think?  I'm not<br/>
asking for big bright neon signs, pointing like fingers of god at the<br/>
location of the box. Nor am I asking for clues that say, "Walk up to the<br/>
ranger station and ask for the stamp." either. But I am asking for someway<br/>
of indicating that the box is in trouble or at least suspected of being so.<br/>
I went on the 9th to Tumwater Falls here in Washington State and we came<br/>
across a box that had been vandalized and the stump it was in severly<br/>
damaged.  We contacted the placer, only becuase we know them and had just<br/>
seen them at the gathering.  Now, if anyone else goes after that box, by<br/>
your words, it's ok, they at least figured upt the clues, correct?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You may wonder just how that game is akin to the letterboxing of today?<br/>
&gt;The stamp, the log book, the little water-tight container...  the<br/>
&gt;palpable pieces are actually quite similar.  Unfortunately, the<br/>
intangibles,<br/>
&gt;those things which are truly the heart and spirit of the game, have<br/>
&gt;been all but lost and replaced with "letterbox-by-number" style clues,<br/>
&gt;easy enough for the average eight-year old to walk right up to the<br/>
&gt;box and add another "F" to his count in a matter of a few minutes.  And<br/>
&gt;since everybody knows that the average eight-year old has much<br/>
&gt;better things to do with his time than take short walks to letterboxes that<br/>
&gt;no longer exist, today's version of the game has been modified to<br/>
&gt;provide players with up-to-date status information of boxes, thus making<br/>
&gt;it easier to determine which set of directions will give the best<br/>
&gt;chance of rewarding a player with an "F".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I'll say this much on this last part and please do not take offense at my<br/>
words, they are not intended to be sarcastic or mean, they are, after all,<br/>
only words.  I'm sure my first boxes are going to be easy. I'm not as<br/>
skilled as other folks are. But I will be and I will gladly read posts that<br/>
say that they searched for hours and couldn't find it, only to go back and<br/>
almost walk over it.  We all get better as we pratice.  but, before you<br/>
condem the abilities of others, please remember that we are a product of the<br/>
society that we grew up in.  The fellows of Dartmoor back in the late 1800's<br/>
thought and acted differently than we do today.  Back then, I feel certain<br/>
that the majority of damage done to boxes was by animals, not by drunken<br/>
teenagers foraging around for a place to have sex at.  And no, the<br/>
intangables have not been lost, it's just that no one teaches them anymore.<br/>
No one teaches new people how to do this sport for the most part... Now a<br/>
days, when a new person asks a question, for the most part, other than a<br/>
simple welcome to the group message, they then get a "Welll, if you're to<br/>
lazy to read the FAQ's, it's not my fault."  Truth be known, not many are<br/>
teachers nor have that temperment, to deal with the same question, day,<br/>
after day, after day, after day.  If you don't like the<br/>
Letterbox-by-Numbers, then help train the new persons to make it better for<br/>
all to enjoy.  Providing up to the date status's is, in my NOT so humble<br/>
opinion, a good way for someone who's juggling kids, strollers, and limited<br/>
time, to best be able to determine if thier time is being speant wisely or<br/>
if they should forgo that box till later.  And the only person that should<br/>
be doing the status of a box is the owner of that box, not some lost person<br/>
who couldn't find thier way out of a wet paper bag with a compass and the<br/>
other end open.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The "new and improved" version is available now at a location near you<br/>
&gt;(and since you are in CT, it is actually waiting just outside your<br/>
&gt;front door).<br/>

Thank you for your words.  I totally feel the same way.<br/>
I however want to add that I started this letterboxing as a fun <br/>
treasure hunt for my family to get out and enjoy nature.  When other <br/>
non-letterboxers ask me what I get for finding boxes, what do you <br/>
win if you find so many???  I say nothing, I get the joy of finding <br/>
great parks and places I never knew existed until I found there was <br/>
a letterbox there.  It is not in the number of finds you have or <br/>
boxes you have placed it is just the simple joy of getting out in <br/>
nature!!<br/>

der Mad Stamper's and it cannot be updated on his website unless he does it.  We have requested control of it and Marquam Trail and several other DMS boxes so that futile hunts don't frustrate other newbies as it did us.  Maybe DMS is lurking or at least Mark, the Silver Eagle, and, can contact him for removal or replacement, otherwise we have a plan for Council Crest.  In the meantime, hunts continue for boxes no longer exist.  I look forward to seeing what you are able to do on myndworks.  <br/>

location of the box. Nor am I asking for clues that say, "Walk up to the<br/>
ranger station and ask for the stamp." either. But I am asking for someway<br/>
of indicating that the box is in trouble or at least suspected of being so.<br/>
I went on the 9th to Tumwater Falls here in Washington State and we came<br/>
across a box that had been vandalized and the stump it was in severly<br/>
damaged.  We contacted the placer, only becuase we know them and had just<br/>
seen them at the gathering.  Now, if anyone else goes after that box, by<br/>
your words, it's ok, they at least figured upt the clues, correct?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You may wonder just how that game is akin to the letterboxing of today?<br/>
&gt;The stamp, the log book, the little water-tight container...  the<br/>
&gt;palpable pieces are actually quite similar.  Unfortunately, the<br/>
intangibles,<br/>
&gt;those things which are truly the heart and spirit of the game, have<br/>
&gt;been all but lost and replaced with "letterbox-by-number" style clues,<br/>
&gt;easy enough for the average eight-year old to walk right up to the<br/>
&gt;box and add another "F" to his count in a matter of a few minutes.  And<br/>
&gt;since everybody knows that the average eight-year old has much<br/>
&gt;better things to do with his time than take short walks to letterboxes that<br/>
&gt;no longer exist, today's version of the game has been modified to<br/>
&gt;provide players with up-to-date status information of boxes, thus making<br/>
&gt;it easier to determine which set of directions will give the best<br/>
&gt;chance of rewarding a player with an "F".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I'll say this much on this last part and please do not take offense at my<br/>
words, they are not intended to be sarcastic or mean, they are, after all,<br/>
only words.  I'm sure my first boxes are going to be easy. I'm not as<br/>
skilled as other folks are. But I will be and I will gladly read posts that<br/>
say that they searched for hours and couldn't find it, only to go back and<br/>
almost walk over it.  We all get better as we pratice.  but, before you<br/>
condem the abilities of others, please remember that we are a product of the<br/>
society that we grew up in.  The fellows of Dartmoor back in the late 1800's<br/>
thought and acted differently than we do today.  Back then, I feel certain<br/>
that the majority of damage done to boxes was by animals, not by drunken<br/>
teenagers foraging around for a place to have sex at.  And no, the<br/>
intangables have not been lost, it's just that no one teaches them anymore.<br/>
No one teaches new people how to do this sport for the most part... Now a<br/>
days, when a new person asks a question, for the most part, other than a<br/>
simple welcome to the group message, they then get a "Welll, if you're to<br/>
lazy to read the FAQ's, it's not my fault."  Truth be known, not many are<br/>
teachers nor have that temperment, to deal with the same question, day,<br/>
after day, after day, after day.  If you don't like the<br/>
Letterbox-by-Numbers, then help train the new persons to make it better for<br/>
all to enjoy.  Providing up to the date status's is, in my NOT so humble<br/>
opinion, a good way for someone who's juggling kids, strollers, and limited<br/>
time, to best be able to determine if thier time is being speant wisely or<br/>
if they should forgo that box till later.  And the only person that should<br/>
be doing the status of a box is the owner of that box, not some lost person<br/>
who couldn't find thier way out of a wet paper bag with a compass and the<br/>
other end open.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The "new and improved" version is available now at a location near you<br/>
&gt;(and since you are in CT, it is actually waiting just outside your<br/>
&gt;front door).<br/>
