It's this type of tongue in cheek that many on this list seem to take as a<br>
sarcastic tone of voice.  Most everyone should know that this hobby came<br>
from Dartmoor, if they don't then I'm sure that someone will point it out to<br>

<br>
I've one simple question here, asked in all humility and deference... how<br>
does one master the challenge if they can not locate the end, or the prize,<br>
or at least a sign that they have in fact, mastered the challenge?  By the<br>
simple fact that they assume they were correct in the translation?  If<br>
that's so, then I get the gold and silver buried at the Desprado in the west<br>
somewhere becuase I think I've gotten that muystery all figured out.  Oh,<br>
wait... That's right... If I do figure it out, I DO get all the gold and<br>
silver buried there.  Here, if someone or something vandalizes a box and I<br>
drive 3+ hours, as I will be this Wed, to get to the location, that's too<br>
bad, it's all a part of the sport, right?  3 hours of wear and tear on my<br>
car, the gas and food I speant money on to get there and all for what? So I<br>
could prove I was able to decipher the clues correctly, I think?  I'm not<br>
asking for big bright neon signs, pointing like fingers of god at the<br>
location of the box. Nor am I asking for clues that say, "Walk up to the<br>
ranger station and ask for the stamp." either. But I am asking for someway<br>
of indicating that the box is in trouble or at least suspected of being so.<br>
I went on the 9th to Tumwater Falls here in Washington State and we came<br>
across a box that had been vandalized and the stump it was in severly<br>
damaged.  We contacted the placer, only becuase we know them and had just<br>
seen them at the gathering.  Now, if anyone else goes after that box, by<br>
your words, it's ok, they at least figured upt the clues, correct?<br>

I'll say this much on this last part and please do not take offense at my<br>
words, they are not intended to be sarcastic or mean, they are, after all,<br>
only words.  I'm sure my first boxes are going to be easy. I'm not as<br>
skilled as other folks are. But I will be and I will gladly read posts that<br>
say that they searched for hours and couldn't find it, only to go back and<br>
almost walk over it.  We all get better as we pratice.  but, before you<br>
condem the abilities of others, please remember that we are a product of the<br>
society that we grew up in.  The fellows of Dartmoor back in the late 1800's<br>
thought and acted differently than we do today.  Back then, I feel certain<br>
that the majority of damage done to boxes was by animals, not by drunken<br>
teenagers foraging around for a place to have sex at.  And no, the<br>
intangables have not been lost, it's just that no one teaches them anymore.<br>
No one teaches new people how to do this sport for the most part... Now a<br>
days, when a new person asks a question, for the most part, other than a<br>
simple welcome to the group message, they then get a "Welll, if you're to<br>
lazy to read the FAQ's, it's not my fault."  Truth be known, not many are<br>
teachers nor have that temperment, to deal with the same question, day,<br>
after day, after day, after day.  If you don't like the<br>
Letterbox-by-Numbers, then help train the new persons to make it better for<br>
all to enjoy.  Providing up to the date status's is, in my NOT so humble<br>
opinion, a good way for someone who's juggling kids, strollers, and limited<br>
time, to best be able to determine if thier time is being speant wisely or<br>
if they should forgo that box till later.  And the only person that should<br>
be doing the status of a box is the owner of that box, not some lost person<br>
who couldn't find thier way out of a wet paper bag with a compass and the<br>
other end open.<br>

Thank you for your words.  I totally feel the same way.<br>
I however want to add that I started this letterboxing as a fun <br>
treasure hunt for my family to get out and enjoy nature.  When other <br>
non-letterboxers ask me what I get for finding boxes, what do you <br>
win if you find so many???  I say nothing, I get the joy of finding <br>
great parks and places I never knew existed until I found there was <br>
a letterbox there.  It is not in the number of finds you have or <br>
boxes you have placed it is just the simple joy of getting out in <br>
nature!!<br>

der Mad Stamper's and it cannot be updated on his website unless he does it.  We have requested control of it and Marquam Trail and several other DMS boxes so that futile hunts don't frustrate other newbies as it did us.  Maybe DMS is lurking or at least Mark, the Silver Eagle, and, can contact him for removal or replacement, otherwise we have a plan for Council Crest.  In the meantime, hunts continue for boxes no longer exist.  I look forward to seeing what you are able to do on myndworks.  <br>

I'll say this much on this last part and please do not take offense at my<br>
words, they are not intended to be sarcastic or mean, they are, after all,<br>
only words.  I'm sure my first boxes are going to be easy. I'm not as<br>
skilled as other folks are. But I will be and I will gladly read posts that<br>
say that they searched for hours and couldn't find it, only to go back and<br>
almost walk over it.  We all get better as we pratice.  but, before you<br>
condem the abilities of others, please remember that we are a product of the<br>
society that we grew up in.  The fellows of Dartmoor back in the late 1800's<br>
thought and acted differently than we do today.  Back then, I feel certain<br>
that the majority of damage done to boxes was by animals, not by drunken<br>
teenagers foraging around for a place to have sex at.  And no, the<br>
intangables have not been lost, it's just that no one teaches them anymore.<br>
No one teaches new people how to do this sport for the most part... Now a<br>
days, when a new person asks a question, for the most part, other than a<br>
simple welcome to the group message, they then get a "Welll, if you're to<br>
lazy to read the FAQ's, it's not my fault."  Truth be known, not many are<br>
teachers nor have that temperment, to deal with the same question, day,<br>
after day, after day, after day.  If you don't like the<br>
Letterbox-by-Numbers, then help train the new persons to make it better for<br>
all to enjoy.  Providing up to the date status's is, in my NOT so humble<br>
opinion, a good way for someone who's juggling kids, strollers, and limited<br>
time, to best be able to determine if thier time is being speant wisely or<br>
if they should forgo that box till later.  And the only person that should<br>
be doing the status of a box is the owner of that box, not some lost person<br>
who couldn't find thier way out of a wet paper bag with a compass and the<br>
other end open.<br>
