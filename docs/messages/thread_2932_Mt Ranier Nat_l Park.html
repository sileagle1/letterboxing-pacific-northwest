<br/>
 I have a question maybe someone here can help me with. My family is <br/>
going camping at Mt Ranier next week and, like I always do, I looked up <br/>
to see what letterboxes are in the area and am really having a hard <br/>
time finding any. Can this be? I can't quite believe this to be true.I <br/>
figured in a place like Mt Ranier we'd be tripping over boxes!<br/>
<br/>
  I've looked on LBNA and AQ and have only found one in the whole park. <br/>
Being a somewhat experienced boxer I feel like I'm doing a decent job <br/>
with my searches at those sites, but maybe I'm missing something. <br/>
<br/>
  So I appeal to you out there who may be more local than I (in <br/>
Portland), or more experienced ("Heck ya! I've been there and found a <br/>
bunch of boxes!") for any advice or info. <br/>
<br/>
                     Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The main reason that you have trouble finding letterboxes in the mt <br/>
rainier area is because it is a NATIONAL PARK. If a letterboxer <br/>
did "break the rules" and plant a letterbox in a NATIONAL PARK, then <br/>
perhaps they would make it a mystery clue and therefore the location <br/>
would not be so easy to figure out. <br/>
