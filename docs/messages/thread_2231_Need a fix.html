There is a LB/Geocache (large sized ammo can) called Bucky the Beaver <br>
at Armitage Park (90064 Coburg Rd. - exit 199 just N of Eugene). I <br>
believe it is 2.1 mi. from I-5. There is a $3 fee or you could walk in. <br>
You can see the freeway from the box location. However, I couldn't find <br>
it on 8/6 (maybe someone had it to stamp in? Don't know how I could <br>
miss it!) but someone else did on 8/15!<br>
Happy Hunting!<br>
