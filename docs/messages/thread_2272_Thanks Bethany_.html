I had a great time 'boxing with new people.  It was an interesting change of perspective, and maybe it will make me better at finding boxes in general.  (But I don't know that I'll EVER find a Ryan box...haha...)<br>
 <br>
And thanks to dbltall for the cool, impromptu bicycle stamp!  That was a nice bonus.<br>
 <br>
I hope to see you all again!<br>

I must add my thanks also for teamCatnip.  It was great to meet the <br>
people whose stamps and boxes we see out there.<br>

I had a great time at my first letterboxing event and being able to<br>
place people's faces with their trail names. :)<br>
