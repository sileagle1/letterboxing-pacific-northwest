<br/>
We letterboxers tend to be a pretty independent bunch. The likelihood<br/>
of getting everyone to cooperate on an annual maintenance event seems<br/>
pretty unlikely. Personally, my boxes are spread so far and wide that<br/>
the only way I can possibly do maintenance is to do it when I'm in a<br/>
particlular area and spread it out over the year. Funhog <br/>
