Summer Bloom is the first listing on AQ when you do a location search <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am already back from my quick visit. We took a lovely stroll in<br>
Stanley Park yesterday morning and were rewarded with a lot of<br>
beautiful photographs and a wonderful memory of sitting on a wet log,<br>
thousands of golden maple leaves at our feet while we stamped into<br>
your box there. <br>
<br>
We than headed for Granville Island for lunch. We saved the letterbox<br>
for dessert. Sad to say, Summer Bloom eluded us. We had to leave twice<br>
to wait for folks to leave the hidey hole but when we finally got our<br>
turn there, all we managed to find behind the post was a plethora of<br>
spider webs. I was picking them out of my hair the rest of the afternoon. <br>
<br>
Many thanks for sending us to two great spots. I'm only sorry there<br>
wasn't enough time for the other suggestions here. Perhaps next time.<br>
