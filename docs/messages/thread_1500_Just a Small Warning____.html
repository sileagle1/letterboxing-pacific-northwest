Just a small warning....when letterboxing....go in a<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This particular box requires thinking outside of the box, no doubt about it.<br>
I got it, but it's a tough one. I can think of several others in Portland<br>
that have stymied people! Of course I would never name names.. but the<br>
placers know who they are :)<br>
<br>
But you're absolutely right, I try to never letterbox alone, and to assess<br>
every situation for safety before I head out. As a matter, because I often<br>
will go down the trail and pick up a box and bring it back to a central spot<br>
for the kids to stamp in, my husband bought us a set of walkie talkies so I<br>
can stay in contact with someone at all times.<br>
<br>
I can tell you that the two men you saw are NOT the placers of that box.<br>
<br>
Stay safe and always take a friend. Yet another good reason to make<br>
connections with other boxers, to have someone to call and say, HEY, I need<br>
a spotter.<br>

I can confirm that neither Pupp nor I have changed our genders recently.  (grin and wink)  Nope, those guys weren't us.  However, from the description of they're positions, they may well have been looking for the same thing.  You made an EXCELLENT call... always trust your warning instincts, and never box (or anything else) alone, especially in isolated locations.  No box or stamp... or anything... is worth showing up on a milk carton.  The ever humble Pupp says, "Not even one of *my* excellent stamps."  (Insert coughing fit and hysterical laughter here.)<br>

May your finds be many and your hitchhikers always call home,<br>

I found one today and am not sure if the goal is to<br>
get it back to the finder - however one might do that<br>
- or get it as far away to other places as possible?<br>

However, today we came up with the idea to carve one of our permanant email addys on our stamps from now on. That way... log book, directions or none at all... there will always be a means for someone down the line to email us and let us know where the HH is. Realisticly, we don't expect to see our HHs again... but we'd like them to, "call home," now and again.<br>

<br>
The fact is that I'd never have done anything fun during my life <br>
between highschool and meeting Pupp... and trust me, that was a heck <br>
of a lot of years! *chuckle*... if I'd had lived by that caveat <br>
either.  No doing air medical transport in Hawaii... no having fun <br>
at biker rallies... no week long raodtrips just to meet chat buddies <br>
face to face... thats how I met Pupp, BTW.  So, your point is well <br>
taken.  The trust your own instincts rule is certainly the best one <br>
by far when it comes to practicality.<br>
<br>
We should go on a Motorcycle/letterboxing weekend.  There is a 500 <br>
shadow and a 1200 Venture Sidecar rig between Pupp and myself!  <br>
Labradors adore the sidecar... and doggie drool really does fly in <br>
the wind!  UGH!!<br>
<br>
May your finds be many and your HHs always call home.<br>
