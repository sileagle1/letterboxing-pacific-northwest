Find the town represented by zipcode 97057. Make your way to the town's US Postal <br>
Service letterbox. Across the street, you will see a couple of stiff ol' buckaroos <br>
swapping talltales. Take note of the wall behind them because you will find a broken <br>
bit of this same material hiding the letterbox. Look to the east where the town's <br>
moniker is emblazoned on a huge field of red. Walk to the eastern side of this <br>
structure. Counting fifteen bats from the stair, you will find the letterbox at your feet. <br>
