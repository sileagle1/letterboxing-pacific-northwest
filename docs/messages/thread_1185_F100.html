Next weekend I should find my 100th box.  So I wanted to get some opinions<br>
from the local community.. what is your favorite box? I want my 100th find<br>
to be an extra special, "must have" box.  In order to keep things from<br>
hurting anyone's feelings.. please email me off list!<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>

If you haven't gotten it, I think the Crappy Stamp Letterbox might be <br>
a worthy for your 100th find.  ;o)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I found my 100th box.  I found it nestled under a stump on the Upper<br>
Macleay trail.  It was an adorable stamp, and a perfect day for the climb.<br>
<br>
We started out today with 93 boxes and finished off the day with 101.. an<br>
excellent day if I do say so myself.  We found all 4 of the Upper Macay Park<br>
series boxes in fine shape (two were a little damp, but otherwise in<br>
excellent health).  The walk down there is beautiful.  I had never even been<br>
up to that part of town, I will DEFINATELY have to go back.  We planted a<br>
box down there the headed back to the car for lunch. After lunch I headed up<br>
the hill after the Goofy Pub Names series.  I found all but number 4, which<br>
it seems others have had troubles with as well.  I left a box on the hill as<br>
well.  I'm going to post the clues for the two boxes we planted now!<br>
<br>
Thank you to everyone that has taken the time and effort to plant the<br>
fabulous boxes I've found so far this year.  100 boxes in 22 weeks.. what a<br>
wonderful way to get outside and enjoy the beautiful Oregon countryside.<br>
I've gone places I never knew existed and learned a whole new craft!<br>
<br>
Thank you again.<br>
