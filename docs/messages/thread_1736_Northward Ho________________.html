As of last night (Oct 25th, 2004) I've accepted a full time position <br/>
with a company in Galena, AK. Yeppers, that's right, Team Rayvenhaus <br/>
will be moving to Alaska. With the recent event (FF2) let me tell you <br/>
this decision was hard to make. You guys are some of the greatest people <br/>
that we've met and it took a lot for us to decide to do this. The <br/>
deciding factor was full time work. I've been working contract jobs for <br/>
quite a few months now at a severe pay cut and we've only been falling <br/>
farther and farther behind. Having started looking for work elsewhere <br/>
when nothing seemed to be coming up in Washington, led me to look North: <br/>
Maine, Alaska, Minnesota, etc, etc, etc. This offer came so fast, we <br/>
really didn't have much time to think about it, and really didn't need <br/>
to since I've got to support of my family first.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice it to say that we shall miss each and everyone one of you guys <br/>
here in the Pacific Northwest. I know that some of the recent events may <br/>
make others think that there is an animosity between myself and a few <br/>
others in this area, but that's not true, not anymore. I only wish each <br/>
and everyone person in this hobby to enjoy it in their own way. <br/>
<br/>
Godspeed to one and all.  We shall live vicariously through the websites <br/>
and the groups as we attempt to introduce letterboxing to a community of <br/>
600!<br/>

Galena, Alaska is 131 miles due west of the geographic center of<br/>
Alaska, bring your long johns!!  Seriously, I really hate to see you<br/>
move but I'm sure you will enjoy your new home and a good paying job<br/>
is not a bad thing.  You will be greatly missed by the PNW<br/>
letterboxing community.<br/>

I know letterboxing isn't very big up there, but you just might be the<br/>
people to get it going.  My husband and I plan on a trip back to Anchorage<br/>
next June and I want to plant a few boxes then - in places that mean<br/>
something to me.<br/>

Best of luck and thanks for everything you've done down here.<br/>

My goodness!  I've always wanted to visit Alaska.  Maybe even take a<br/>
high-paying, part-time job for the summer to fund some other great<br/>
adventure.  Not sure I'd actually want to spend a winter out there,<br/>
though!  Looks like a beautiful state from the pictures I've seen.  I<br/>
see good hiding places for letterboxes in ALL those pictures!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can show me around the area someday.  ;o)<br/>

Good luck and happy trails!<br/>

Hmmm...I have consulted my handy atlas (which actually sets next to <br/>
the computer at all times-for genealogy purposes) and have surmised <br/>
that you are pretty much going to be in the middle of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
But Galena  apparently has an airport according to Rand &amp; McNally. It <br/>
also appears to be only 125 or so miles from the Artic Circle.I'd say <br/>
that qualifies as a bit chilly. I can see it's about 150 miles north <br/>
of Iditarod as the crow (hey do they have even have crows there)flies.<br/>
<br/>
We should be able to get good,quality reports/testing as to the <br/>
effects of cold, permafrost, snow, the Yukon River and <br/>
reindeer/polarbears/seals on the letterboxes...Lets hope no woolly <br/>
mammoths are inadvertantly excavated by a newbie boxer though. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose this can bring a new twist to letterboxing as you and <br/>
Rayvenmom could each pair up with the kids to hide letterboxes from <br/>
each other if you aren't able to convice the rest of the town about <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
If you need someone to adopt a box or two here in our neck of <br/>
Tacoma/Spanaway I'd be more than willing to.<br/>

&gt;My goodness!  I've always wanted to visit Alaska.  Maybe even take a<br/>
&gt;high-paying, part-time job for the summer to fund some other great<br/>
&gt;adventure.  Not sure I'd actually want to spend a winter out there,<br/>
&gt;though!  Looks like a beautiful state from the pictures I've seen.  I<br/>
&gt;see good hiding places for letterboxes in ALL those pictures!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps you can show me around the area someday.  ;o)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good luck and happy trails!<br/>
