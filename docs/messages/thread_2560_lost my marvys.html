picked them up I'd sure like to know and would send you postage to<br/>
mail them to me.  I'll contact the campground but am hoping that<br/>
someone in our group saw them sitting there and knew they had been<br/>
left behind.  They were brand new, and I'm really peeved at myself for<br/>
leaving them behind.  For identification purposes, one of the little<br/>
round snap-shut dealy bobs on the top of the plastic case had a small<br/>
rip in it, although the case did still snap shut last time I had it. <br/>
These were the primary color pens with brush tip on one end and<br/>
fine-tip marker on the other, 12 of them.  Thanks a bunch to anyone<br/>
who picked them up recognizing them as probably left behind.<br/>
