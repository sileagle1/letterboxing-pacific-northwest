there has been much trail maintenance/boardwalk construction at the <br/>
park and you may want to check on your boxes hidden there to make <br/>

didn't take a clue sheet along with us and didnt remember the <br/>
location of your boxes either due to the changes on the trail.  <br/>

Yesterday, Nailhead did some checking on boxes at the Millers' <br/>
Sylvan*a. The water in the lake is high and flooding into the rest <br/>
of the park in places making the trails especially muddy right now.  <br/>
Chuck's Tacklebox Series is in pretty good shape with a good number <br/>
of visitors but one box is confirmed missing.  This particular box <br/>
is in a flooded area and our guess is that it floated away with the <br/>
high water. Not sure if we will recarve it or just replace it with <br/>
one of the 5 other boxes in the series yet to be located there.  The <br/>
latest visitor to the Chuck's Tacklebox Series, last fall, was a <br/>
33year letterboxing veteran from West Sussex, England!  What an <br/>
honor to have such a veteran boxer visit some of our boxes. Wow, <br/>
what stories she could tell us about bonus boxes, coockoo clues, <br/>
mystery clues and the like! Can you imagine letterboxing for 33 <br/>
years!<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone gets to get out to see these fine boxes soon.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, we'll be getting another one, too--once we're able to come up <br/>
for air someday soon. It's great that the state finally wised up and <br/>
sells them valid for 12 months following the date of purchase <br/>
instead of just valid for the calendar year in which you purchase <br/>
it.  I presume that had a lot to do with poor sales last year.  ;)  <br/>
I guess $$$ speaks volumes--much louder than constituents ever can!<br/>
