In the last couple of years, the TC has had its <br>
members peel off and head for far flung <br>
places, British Columbia, Texas, Thailand, <br>
Salem... Yesterday, a quorum (plus one guest) <br>
managed to meet for a box lunch. Letterbox lunch, <br>
that is! The rendezvous began at the fabulous <br>
Temple of Gluttony mentioned in The Green <br>
Hornet's fine Crime and Punishment #3 <br>
clue. After stamping into the overflowing <br>
logbook and leaving a new scroll for future <br>
visitors we moved on to the eating part of <br>
the day. Beer, burgers and a quickie <br>
carving demo from one of the gang were <br>
the order of the day. <br>
<br>
Since one of the crew has a very uncooperative <br>
knee that was just attacked by a surgeon, no <br>
Green Tortuga hikes were planned for the <br>
afternoon. After a little puzzling and map <br>
searching we found ourselves stamping into <br>
the Everything That Isn't logbook. This is yet <br>
another wonderful stamp by Pandora, one that <br>
I love having in my collection. <br>
<br>
The next stop was a sobering one at the <br>
Holocaust Memorial in Washington Park. <br>
After a brief bit of quiet contemplation, <br>
we found ourselves adding the image from <br>
pupp's lonely letterbox into our logs. This <br>
one is poignantly appropriate for the recently <br>
completed holiday season. After six months in <br>
the wild, we were the first in the log... unless <br>
this was a replacement, of course. <br>
<br>
All in all, this was a most enjoyable way to ring<br>
in yet another year. Make new friends, but keep<br>
the old...Funhog<br>
