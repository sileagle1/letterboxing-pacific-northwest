Feb 10th, 1-4, at the McMinville Community Center (503-434-7310). <br>
<br>
It's intended for newboxers to learn about letterboxing, stamp<br>
carving, etc. If you know anyone who'd be interested, would you please<br>
point them toward the AtlasQuest events page?<br>
<br>
I'll have an event stamp and at least one other brand new letterbox<br>
there. So if any of you experienced letterboxers want to drop in<br>
between 3 and 4, you are welcome to play too. <br>
<br>
I'm doing quite a bit of work for it and I just hope we get some new<br>
boxers out of it! Your happy thoughts directed this way are much<br>
appreciated.<br>
