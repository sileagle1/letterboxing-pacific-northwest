Both have said YES, please adopt our boxes out.<br/>
<br/>
I have two of the boxes from Catbird, Little Happiness and PooPoo.  <br/>
She did not indicate that they have been pulled, so I will go back <br/>
and check Little Happiness.  If I do find it I might relocate it <br/>
slightly away from the Grade Schools project.  I suspect that large <br/>
box is interfering with finds.<br/>
<br/>
We need to make an inventory of Canada Goose boxes ( all along I-5 <br/>
from Mt Vernon to Oregon if I am not mistaken) and get them divvied <br/>
up.<br/>

Oh good, I'm glad you were able to get a hold of her, Hoopoe!!  We'll go <br/>
ahead and adopt Mom, Mexico, and Me (West Linn, OR) then.  I'll have to go check <br/>
on them again.  We never did finish the series as it was TOO HOT when we were <br/>
there! <g><br/>
