                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually Portland is pretty nice for a Large City.  I was able to hide the I Love You HH in a place that has room for many LetterBoxes this last week.  I do not know if it is in the City Limits of Portland, but it is in Multnomah County.  <br>
<br>
Since it came from the East Coast (and is glad it has :-) and has visited an East Coast gathering (with many stamps from that area, so you can match the stamp with the name :-), hopefully whomever finds it will save it for the upcoming Portland Area gathering (which I will unfortunately not be able to attend :-(.  <br>
<br>
Get out and find it!  The weather is great (except the day I placed it, it was raining :-(  If there is no message that it has been found in time for the gathering, will let you know where it is so that everyone can enjoy it!!!<br>
