adventure.<br>
<br>
I plotted a trip south.  Starting at the wonderful "Book Keeper" in <br>
Longview placed by Lotta and Lillbit.  I found the first book but Mon <br>
Ami, I had a bit of trouble finding the second.  I was in the right <br>
location but could not find the absolute.  It was nice to see a <br>
Georgia Gerber.  Osprey were courting over the waterway too.  I will <br>
ponder a book to contribute.<br>
<br>
I headed north from there and stopped at Jacksons Cabin ( after <br>
waiting for the grounds keeper to leave).  Rain splattered me at the <br>
Fallen Rainbow, but with no sun breaks there were no rainbows to <br>
enjoy.  Trilliums however are out in force.<br>
<br>
Note of Brag  For Trillium lovers, now is the time to visit my boxes <br>
at Bridle Trails SP in Kirkland.<br>
<br>
Amanda's vaguely vague "Find A" LB was a good challenge.  It was then <br>
the rain started in full force.  <br>
<br>
dvn2r ckr's Buggy Letterbox at Rotary Riverside appears to have left <br>
when the fallen tree was removed.  Nothing left but a newly cut <br>
ground level stump.<br>
<br>
The Lost Locomotive was easily found.<br>
<br>
It must have been a good day because I did not get cheesed off at the <br>
traffic north from Olympia.<br>
<br>
I will have to take account of the Count another time.  <br>
