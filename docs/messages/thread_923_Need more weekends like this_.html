Fest '03.  It was great to see Campfire Lady & Willow & crew again.  <br>
See Shore (who is my mother-in-law) hasn't had many chances to <br>
letterbox, so she cleaned up on the exchanges this weekend, and <br>
doubled her F count and then some!  Even picked up an event stamp.  <br>
<br>
After all the fun on Sunday, I decided to forget doing the stupid <br>
errands I had to do on Monday and went letterboxing instead.  It <br>
isn't as much fun to go alone, though.<br>
<br>
First went and checked out Corps of Discovery at Frenchman's Bar.  <br>
Great stamp, nasty tree!  Everything was in good shape.<br>
<br>
Next headed out to Rookery.  Watch out for evidence of cows when you <br>
go do this one!  Box was fine...really like the logbook on this <br>
one.  No one had been to either of these boxes for a while.  Got to <br>
see a huge flock of birds fly around.  What an amazing sight.  Wish <br>
I knew more about birds!<br>
<br>
Finally I snuck in Smith & Bybee Lake.  Amazing spot that I had no <br>
idea was there.  Again saw some beautiful wildlife and really <br>
enjoyed the peaceful area.  Learned my lesson about assuming you <br>
know which log the clues are talking about and wasted a lot of time <br>
before I pulled out my compass.  Duh!  No one had been there for a <br>
while either.  This is a lovely spot right now with the leaves all <br>
turning colors.  Nice walk (although I wouldn't call it a "short <br>
stroll").<br>
<br>
Thanks for the fun everyone!  I'm ready to go out again.  Hmmm.  <br>
Maybe I can convince hubby (who may become SeaHunter if I can get <br>
him to decide) we should go pick up a few more today!<br>
