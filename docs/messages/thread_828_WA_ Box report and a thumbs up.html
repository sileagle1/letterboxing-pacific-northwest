This is a good series to introduce newbies to "how to hide a box" and <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">COOL!!!!  *blush* and thanks! we had a GREAT time building it -- i carved and Sunshine did *all* the compass work (for her Y camp) -- we both had a blast -- glad it was so much fun for an experienced boxer too!!!<br>
<br>
yea -- the Impala is Sunshine's favorite too -- I think mine's the Lion, but it's close :>.<br>
<br>
and you're now the 3rd report of missing pygmy hippos... so i think i'll have to go check it and possibly replace it...<br>
<br>
And isn't the tree cover great?  you can avoid most of the rain with that much cover!<br>
