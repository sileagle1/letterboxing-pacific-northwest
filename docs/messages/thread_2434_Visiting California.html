be visiting Sonoma County to see my grandparents for a week.  :)  My <br/>
grandparents aren't hikers (at all!) so I was hoping to snag some drive-bys or <br/>
something, just to say I've found boxes in CA.  I know they won't want to hit the <br/>
trails!  Can anyone recommend some good drive-ups in the Santa Rosa area?<br/>
<br/>
Also, perhaps I could schedule a day that I could meet up with some boxers to <br/>
exchange and/or swap hitchhikers with?  Maybe at a coffee shop or a winery.  <br/>
:)  Email me if you're interested!<br/>

&gt; Hey, guys!  Not sure if this is the right message board,<br/>
<br/>
It isn't the correct chat list. Take a look at the top part of the <br/>
home page and you will note a mention of the LbCNA and if you click on <br/>
that it will take you where you want to go. In fact you will find that <br/>
that list is already talking about you.<br/>
