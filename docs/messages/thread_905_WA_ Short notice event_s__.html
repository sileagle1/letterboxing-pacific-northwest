<br>
EskieLover and I can make it Monday night.  The Oyster House has great seafood, and would be an excellent choice.  There are also several other very nice places here in Oly, but the OH is a good choice.<br>
<br>
Will not be able to make it on the 15th, previous engagements would, believe it or not, take precedence.<br>

  Hi all folks in the Seattle/Tacoma/Olympia area and all others who <br>
  may be interested in attending---<br>
<br>
  We have an opportunity to coordinate a last minute exchange <br>
  gathering for Silver Eagle, an avid letterboxer from a really BIG <br>
  state in the contiguous United States who will be visiting our neck <br>
  of the woods next week.  We have two 'windows of opportunity' during <br>
  which we may be able to meet with our mutual friend in letterboxing--<br>
<br>
                       ******************<br>
<br>
  Would anybody be able to attend one or either of the following <br>
  events?<br>
<br>
  --Monday, 10 Nov 03--evening/dinner event in the Olympia area <br>
  (thinking along the lines of the Oyster House on the marina--upscale <br>
  sports bar type of an establishment that is very welcome to children <br>
  or some other similar environs)<br>
<br>
  --Saturday, 15 Nov 03--0900-1030 quick exchange event at Wapato Park <br>
  in Tacoma (with all exchanges ending precisely at 1030 so one Silver <br>
  Eagle can catch his return flight home shortly thereafter)<br>
<br>
                      ******************<br>
<br>
  Please let me know if you would be able to attend such an event <br>
  (either post to the board or write me directly)!  Also, include the <br>
  number of folks in your party who would also be able to attend.  I <br>
  need to know the details about the Monday night event by tomorrow <br>
  afternoon at the latest.  As for the Saturday event, we have a bit <br>
  more coordination time.<br>
<br>
  Thank you in advance,<br>

Sorry about your Grandmother and that I won't get to meet ya'll.<br>
Ironically, I will just miss meeting you at the cemetery since I<br>
already had planned on going for your 2 boxes there on Sunday<br>
afternoon on my way to Portland.  My own grandmother lived<br>
to be 99 and I have great respect for that generation.  I will<br>
be thinking of your family as I look for your boxes.<br>
