                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here are some great places within walking distance  of the <br>
staion.<br>
<br>
The Smith Tower- once the tallest building in the west<br>
<br>
The Klondike Gold Rush Museum- actually a national park<br>
<br>
Uwajimaya-, Asian grocery and book store<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Google will get you good info on all. <br>
<br>
<br>
The Smith Tower is still a working office building and I'm not <br>
sure if they'll let you up to the top or not, but the Lobby is beautiful <br>
and really takes you back in time. They have operators that run <br>
the elevators.<br>
<br>
The Klondike museum has moves since I  was last there but the <br>
web should get you updated info.  It is free and very informative. If <br>
it's really rainy you can sit down and watch a movie to warm up. <br>
<br>
Uwajimaya is THE store in the International District.  Lots of <br>
weird and differant food.  There is a food court in the store with 5 <br>
or six differant resturants, very casual.  My son always likes the <br>
Dragon dangling from the ceiling.<br>
<br>
Know you'll have fun no matter what you do.<br>

I remember seeing brochures for it, but it does cost money if you want<br>
to see the view from the top. I don't remember how much, though, but<br>
it is possible to get to the top.<br>
<br>
Speaking of great views, there's also a pretty darned good one from<br>
the top of Columbia Tower (a.k.a. Bank of America Tower)--the tallest<br>
building in the northwest--IF you're willing to walk 69 stories (1,311<br>
steps) and pay the now $50 entrance fee for the Big Climb for Leukemia<br>
on March 18th. Tons of fun. =)<br>

I can't do it this year, but I have before and you really do get some<br>
AMAZING views from the top. *nodding* <br>

Re: Columbia Tower--Weren't there some free smoothies along the way, <br>
too?  That'd be enough to get me up those steps.  ;)<br>
