Funhog's recent post about AZ Roadie's list of found boxes (holy moley--does <br/>
that person ever SLEEP?!) leads me to ask what people think about posting <br/>
finds.   Of course, I am talking about posts that don't include any spoilers <br/>
(including not lumping a mystery box in with a list of other boxes to preclude <br/>
people deducing its location).   Personally, I 'd always enjoyed reading about <br/>
others' finds, but as I recall someone suggested they didn't like it and a flame <br/>
war erupted over the subject.   By that time my asbestos suit was wearing <br/>
quite thin in places, so I stopped posting about my finds.   <br/>
I'm hoping to launch a reasonable discussion about the pros and cons of box <br/>
updates on this list.   <br/>
<br/>
Here's an example of what I mean by a box update: <br/>
(Subject: Portland, OR 3rd Fate of Childhood Series)<br/>
Today Heather, her daughter Button and I finally went after Pandora's third <br/>
Childhood series.   We had a chilly but lovely morning tracking down The Old <br/>
Lady Who Swallowed a Fly, Good Ship Lolipop, and Mary's Little Lamb.   We even <br/>
stopped the evil Mukesh in his tracks--but when Heather turned the last page of <br/>
the clues she'd printed out, instead of reading where the hiding place of the <br/>
last box was, she said, "Don't hate me."   Yes, she had left the final page <br/>
at home!!!   We wandered about the area for a brief while in an attempt to <br/>
mind-merge with Pandora and find the box free-style, but Pandy musta still been <br/>
asleep or something because somehow the connection failed.   <br/>
So guess where we're headed (again) tomorrow afternoon?   <br/>
Thanks Pandora and Iron Bear!   What a fun series!!!<br/>

I  enjoy hearing about updates  on  boxes, and keep  a  Outlook folder<br/>
with updates.  The only downside is that I don't have the list<br/>
memorized the way many of you seem to, and I can't tell what state or<br/>
part of a state the box is located in!  It is always helpful to me<br/>
when people say  "I was in the Canon Beach, Or, area and found xyz<br/>
-watch out for poison oak..."  I keep  an  Outlook folder for notes<br/>
like that, and I  can check for helpful hints before  we go out.  <br/>
<br/>
I also like the updates from people who have planted boxes and report<br/>
on maintenance  trips. It can be frustrating to look for a box that's<br/>
not there, and after e-mailing the placer, they knew it, but hadn't<br/>
updated  the clue list yet. I'm sure it's hard to stay on top of these<br/>
things, so extra input is always welcome for others.<br/>
