  I have been reading the message boards and would like to add my 50 <br>
cents on some of the subjects if I may.<br>
I read the article in the Portland Parents magazine and that is how I <br>
found out about this great pastime. If it is decided to have the <br>
article written in the Columbian there should be an emphasis put on <br>
the rules of etiquette for letterboxing. This pastime is not to be <br>
taken lightly and should be respected so that it may be enjoyed by <br>
everyone wishing to participate. Besides, it might get more <br>
letterboxes hidden for us to find. *wink* My mother was visiting from <br>
So. CA. when I read the article so now she is a mad hunter in <br>
California. I have become so involved in this that I am setting out <br>
today to place a few Hitch Hikers along the way.<br>
I am planning on hunting down a series of Der Mad Stamper boxes in <br>
the Rock Creek area of Portland and I will let you know the status of <br>
them when I get back. I am hoping they are still there. My 8 year old <br>
daughter "Cat's Meow" is as excited as I am!<br>
