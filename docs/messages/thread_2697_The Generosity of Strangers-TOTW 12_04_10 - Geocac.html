                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a similar kindness of strangers story. We had placed two boxes<br>
listed under the Order of the Phoenix. We would check on them<br>
occasionally and sometimes find that the Phoenix was visible from the<br>
path, which had me worried that it would go missing. The other box -<br>
the Greenhouse looked to be safe. But then, one day I got an e-mail<br>
from a geocacher! She had found the greenhouse by the side of the<br>
path, and emailed me that day!! So I quick ran over found it all wet<br>
inside and not closed properly, and pulled them both. The clues are<br>
still listed, as retired on letterboxing.org, just for historical,<br>
sentimental value.<br>
<br>
So this is in thanks and praise of our cousins the geocachers!!<br>
