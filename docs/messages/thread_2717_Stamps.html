<br/>
  I've done a lot of stamps in pink stuff, ranging in size from about a square inch to nearly a full sheet, and none of them have backings.  The one that's nearly a full sheet is a bit unwieldy, but useable, without backing.  The smaller ones work just fine, but you might have to be careful  you don't ink up your fingertips when you're putting your stamp on an inkpad.<br/>
<br/>
  And how much will these stamps be used and where?  Some stamps tend to get brittle with time and exposure (lots of time and exposure...) and crack and break.  I've not personally had a problem with this, particularly with pink stuff, but I've heard of it happening to a few wild 'boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  Some people use the foamy stuff you can get at craft stores in sheets.  You can usually find it in the kids' craft section, along with the puffball crafts and stickers and things.  Glue the back of the stamp to a sheet of the thicker foam using a glue gun (or some other strong, slightly flexible glue) and then cut out the foam around the stamp once it's dried.  You'd be surprised at how much it stiffens the stamp!<br/>
<br/>
  Wood and plastic blocks for backing are pretty overrated, in my opinion.  Go with the foam or cardboard, or nothing at all.  I mounted a large-ish hitchhiker stamp to the back of a logbook using Elmer's school glue and it made it all the way to Dartmoor like that, but that was mostly so the book and stamp wouldn't get separated in their travels.  Looks like it worked.<br/>
<br/>
  Happy 'boxing!<br/>
