Just popping in to update this letterbox in Central/South Oregon. We <br>
couldn't access this box in July to check on it due to 4 feet of snow. <br>
I guess we might change the clues to indicate that it might be a two <br>
month access box.<br>
We are still keeping cool on the Oregon coast, but will be heading <br>
inland soon.<br>

We just landed back in Kernville and are pretty pooped  after chasing <br>
all of those great Oregon letterboxes. I did want to appologize to <br>
anyone that went after Dumbledore's  Western Adventure recently as we <br>
moved it on the way back home and couldn't get to a phone hook up to <br>
change the clues.They are now accurate. We did find that there had <br>
been only one letterboxer that was able to solve the clues and major <br>
kudos to Keli, a fairly new letterboxer,who beat the oldtimers(and you <br>
know who you are)to this box. While this is in a fee area, it won't <br>
put a crater in your wallet if you have a Golden Age Pass. We will try <br>
to put together an update on the letterboxes we found on our journey.<br>
<br>
Funhog, there has to be something weird about the Plateau as we had to <br>
replace the electric motor on the drivers side window. The same Chevy <br>
dealership in Red Bluff.<br>
