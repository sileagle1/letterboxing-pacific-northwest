<br>
:-D<br>
<br>
The visitor stumbled upon the box while exploring the interesting <br>
natural feature that is the hiding place.<br>
<br>
So no one has won the box via the difficult clues. :-( (poop)<br>
<br>
The gentleman who found it was kind enough to send me a note and <br>
assured me that the LB was tucked away and hidden well.<br>
<br>
Good to hear good news in a park that appear to have had some unkind <br>
activity assoicated with LB vs Gee Oh Catch<br>
<br>
I will be having a long weekend up in that area next 4th of July and <br>
hope that I will find evidence of other visitors.<br>
