  --SNIP--<br/>
  But worse than No Moon is being stumped by notorious Trial n <br/>
  Error.  Farrels Marsh is quite a beautiful place, a gem within a <br/>
  very nice community.  The clues were not complicated.  Just walk <br/>
  down the path until you see the jumble of logs.  Very direct and to <br/>
  the point as most of Bill's clues are.  And just as usual, the clues <br/>
  are at the same time just as indirect as he can contrive.  The <br/>
  'jumble of logs' turns out to be actually 3 jumbles of logs with no <br/>
  indication as to which to search.  The obvious conclusion is to <br/>
  search all of them.  I am afraid that every frog, newt, and garter <br/>
  snake in the area has been disturbed this afternoon and no <br/>
  tuperware (or more likely black vhs box) was to be found.  After <br/>
  30 minutes of searching and much muffled grumblings on the <br/>
  part of Nailhead, the Nail boys gave up to find other boxes in the <br/>
  area.  We will await a response from the Bill who we consider <br/>
  the king of  the minimalist clues in the South Sound area as to <br/>
  whether it has really walked off before we make another attempt.<br/>

Just make sure they are something one can see on a WAP-enabled cell phone. Or whatever they call it. I have one, but as yet can only get to Google. I lose patience when I try to type something... Must remember get the little keyboard to go with my phone sometime. <br/>

I have been thinking that I would do a mystery box (well, semi-mystery) with pictures as the clues. My other hobby is photography and it would be fun to take pictures that other people would actually SEE (as opposed to the kind I file away in a frame on the wall).  (:  <br/>

&gt; mystery) with pictures as the clues.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see some examples of what you might do with pictures <br/>
as clues, there's the Petroglyph Series I hid in Nevada <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/US/NV/Petroglyph).  Those are one-<br/>
shot deals showing pictures of me hiding the letterbox, and you have <br/>
to find where on the trail it's taken.  I can't vouch that hunting <br/>
down a box with such clues is a lot of fun since I've never had the <br/>
opportunity to FIND such boxes, just hide them.  <br/>
<br/>
Another approach is the St. George box in Utah <br/>
(http://www.aros.net/~hollym/stgeorge.html) that shows a series of <br/>
pictures which you need to follow.  It starts with the "large scene" <br/>
and narrows down until you've found the actual box.  It was a real <br/>
hoot to find and I'd be thrilled if more boxes were like that.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's the Movie Mystery box which is a real hoot to watch, <br/>
although there are some downsides to such a clue since some people <br/>
have problems trying to watch the movie, modem connections are <br/>
interminably slow for such huge files, and there could be space <br/>
limitations for your hosting site such a file might fill up.  Using <br/>
Geocities, you won't see me uploading multi-megabyte files!  But it <br/>
IS a cool clue if those issues don't concern you.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And finally, there's what I've done with a lot of my clues: I've <br/>
added pictures that really don't contribute to the clue itself, but <br/>
they're nice pictures which I took while hiding the letterbox.  I <br/>
still get to show off my pictures, even if they aren't part of the <br/>
clue.  =)<br/>

Carpe diem!<br/>

I was wondering about that. If the person can print out written clues, surely they can print out pictures. I was planning to do my pictures in color, but maybe I will also offer a black &amp; white version. <br/>

We go out rain or shine - the printed photos bleed, run or smudge. Yes we are cheap and do not use plastic protectors, we use coat pockets so far. Then again we are newbies and it makes it more challenging. (snicker, snicker, as if we need more challenging boxes)  <br/>
