If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br/>

If you have military privileges--there's a military rec site with <br/>
cabins near Sedona--actually in Flagstaff--it's Ft Tuthill-Luke AFB <br/>
Rec Area.  We used to camp there all the time when we lived in <br/>
Southeastern AZ off and on over the years.  They have A-frame cabins <br/>
and even RVs you can stay in--but we only camped (my family, minus <br/>
me, stayed in the A-frames on other occasions).  I think you can <br/>
even rent skis there for nearby Flagstaff Ski Slopes.  We used this <br/>
spot as our 'launch' point for hiking trips up to the Grand Canyon <br/>
and mountain biking treks in Sedona.  One long day trip involved <br/>
camping there and a 16 mile rim-river-back to rim canyon hike with a <br/>
return back to the campsite before sunset--so it's a doable option.<br/>
<br/>
Not so sure about the other CA locales.  Lemoore NAS is 'relatively' <br/>
near Modesto (closer to Bakersfield) but one room there ran <br/>
$56/night!  Ouch!!!  Super 8 or Motel 6 on the interstate was about <br/>
$45/night and didn't require a 60 mile 'out of the way' drive <br/>
for 'supposedly' cheap lodging.<br/>
<br/>
Check out: http://www.hostelsweb.com/index.html#northamerica for <br/>
hostel info.  One thing to note, though, is sometimes hostels can be <br/>
MORE expensive for a family than an inexpensively priced hotel--as <br/>
you often pay per person at a hostel--unless they have <br/>
private/family rooms available. We're headed to New Orleans in a few <br/>
days and a 3* hotel, through travelocity, was less expensive than 4 <br/>
beds in a hostel. So, I twisted my own arm and opted for the hotel <br/>
WITH POOL &amp; FREE WI-FI &amp; WALKING DISTANCE TO THE FRENCH QUARTER!  <br/>
Rarely see that stuff at hostels... ;)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip,<br/>

Sheeze, now I'm starting to think spending the night in the train<br/>
station wasn't the best of ideas when I had that layover in New<br/>
Orleans! Though I have to admit, watching hookers try to wrangle in<br/>
fish and being woken by security while trying to sleep had its moments<br/>
too.  All within walking distance of the French Quarter!  =)<br/>
