in favor of a runoff after this poll ends and would suggest posting now <br>

(2, 3, however many) choices beginning Feb. 16, voting will end Feb. <br>
26.  Gives people ten days to vote, they know when the vote will be <br>

thought it kind of weird you could change your vote at any given time up <br>

the best way IMHO.  I mean, if my first choice is way behind on Feb. 14, <br>
I could easily just change my vote to one of the front-runners.  Again, <br>
this is not a very good way to do a run-off, but this ability to change <br>
your vote leaves you that option.  I am not dismayed at all with the <br>
current poll, I think it's a perfect way to start.  I would like to see <br>
a runoff though.<br>

I'm pretty sure that is what the Mid-Atlantic group did - first had a <br>
vote among all the entries, then had a second poll that only included <br>
the top vote-getters.  ... OK, I just checked to be sure, and I did <br>
remember it correctly.  They had 20 choices in the first go-round, then <br>
only 3 in the final vote.<br>

<br>
Don't feel too disgruntled. Sometimes an issue such as this isn't<br>
obvious UNTIL the poll is well underway. After all, if 90% of the<br>
votes went to a single patch, it would have been a moot point! The way<br>
the votes shook out, though, that's not the case.<br>

<br>
Yes, you are absolutely right - the time to raise issues was <br>
beforehand, not now.  Sorry, the timing was lousy.  I don't always read <br>
this group on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
But my concerns remain.  Perhaps we can just have a run-off when the <br>
current poll closes, and perhaps collaspe some of the very similar <br>
designs into a single one (if they get enough votes to be included)?<br>
<br>
Funhog - thanks for taking the initiative on this!  =)  Will try not to <br>
poke holes in your hard work in the future....<br>

<br>
When the LbMA voted on patches, we had a run-off with the finalists. <br>
This was partly because there were some designs that were variants on <br>
the same theme (such as the same general design in different colors), <br>
so we ended up voting on four separate patches/themes that were the <br>
leading contenders in the first round.<br>
<br>
If one patch gets a majority in the current poll, then there's no <br>
need for a run-off, of course. But if the results are close, then <br>
maybe you could consider a run-off poll with the top candidates.<br>
