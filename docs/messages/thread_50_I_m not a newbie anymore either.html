I don't know how or when one decides they are no longer newbies, but <br/>
since we found Multnomah Falls on our second attempt - the first was <br/>
in an out of bounds area but very similar/near the actual location. <br/>
We moved ourselves out of the newbie catagory!!!<br/>
<br/>
I placed my first letterbox today,(which contains one of my first <br/>
handcarved stamps!) so I guess I am no longer a newbie either. I <br/>
must admit that I am addicted to letterboxing. Ever since Wild Woman <br/>
and I stumbled accross LETTERBOXING.ORG and found our first <br/>
letterbox at the Oregan Trail on the same day, we have been hooked!<br/>
(thank you Littlebit and Lottabit for leaving us a true treasure!)<br/>
I now have found 27 letterboxes (including Where's Jack?) since Feb. <br/>
2003. I can't wait to travel to Wyoming this summer and find <br/>
letterboxes all the way. I am excited to find Der Mad Stampers box <br/>
in Green River, WY (the home of my youth).<br/>
I also want to tell Funhog I found her "Beneath the Blue #3" last <br/>
week and it was one of the most wonderful places I have ever been. <br/>
Everyone should put it on the top of their list to find. The stamp <br/>
is really beautiful too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for welcoming us to this great pasttime.<br/>
<br/>
Your faithful letterboxer,<br/>
