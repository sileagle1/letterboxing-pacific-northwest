&gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Went out and checked on several of our boxes yesterday, in<br/>
preparation for winter and <br/>

a reminder <br/>
&gt; especially for you newbies, ( the rest of you have heard it before),<br/>
please treat others <br/>
&gt; boxes with respect and replace the box better than you found it. If<br/>
you don't the boxes <br/>

so they can NOT be <br/>
&gt; seen by passer-by's. I checked 4 boxes yeserday and 3 of them could<br/>
be seen by just <br/>
&gt; walking by. Just my 2 cents worth.<br/>

<br/>
It's possible I lost my first plant because of a bad re-hide, but I think I have to take a little responsibility for that because of two factors: firstly, the spot I chose didn't make for a very easy re-hide; and secondly, I included few instruction in my box.  I like boxes that have clear instructions to rehide so the box cannot be seen.  I think that's helpful, especially for new folks who may not be on the lists.<br/>

<br/>
 It's all about the leaves in the autumn time, but don't forget to use more than that as they <br/>
can blow away. Leaves will also rot away if no one finds the box for a lengthy period of time.<br/>
I prefer using moss (for those of us west of the mountains) if at all possible, it takes a while <br/>
for moss to grow so I think when people see (or don't see) it the brain goes.......hmmm ... <br/>
nothing going on here. a couple of pieces of debris from the area on top makes for a nice <br/>
touch as well.<br/>

We usually walk around the box and make sure it's not visible from any<br/>
direction - paying special attention to the directions where people are most<br/>
likely to be.  I like to use a mix of hiding material so it's location is<br/>
not too obvious.  The sprinkling of leaves, sticks or what ever on top<br/>

Newbies:<br/>
Just a side note - it would be good for newbies to link up with an<br/>
experienced boxer.  It'd be someone to ask questions of.   We've had some<br/>
interesting questions from boxers outside our area. One asked a neighbor by<br/>
the park if they knew where the box is hidden.  Since we haven't heard back<br/>
after several emails, I assume I didn't handle it delicately enough.  It's<br/>
hard to emphasize enough the importance of hiding without stepping on toes.<br/>
Perhaps others are better at this?  I flunked!  {shrug}<br/>

Well it is pretty close. Actually once we rehide the letterbox using <br/>
the typical rocks or other hiding stuff I take a handfull of dirt <br/>
and duff and toss it onto the hiding spot with a top to bottom move <br/>
then take another handfull and do the same thing but with a side to <br/>
side move making a sign of a cross. If it still doesn't look right I <br/>
give it another blessing.<br/>
<br/>
If you walk away from the letterbox thinking,"Boy the next finder is <br/>
going to have some difficulty finding the box right away." then it <br/>
is truly a good rehide.<br/>

&gt; Ah-ha...I think we found a winner! Someone that gives a blessing <br/>
on Letterboxes!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hiding the Box:<br/>
&gt; &gt; We usually walk around the box and make sure it's not visible <br/>
from any<br/>
&gt; &gt; direction - paying special attention to the directions where <br/>
people are most<br/>
&gt; &gt; likely to be.  I like to use a mix of hiding material so it's <br/>
location is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not too obvious.  The sprinkling of leaves, sticks or what ever <br/>
on top<br/>
&gt; &gt; really makes the spot look untouched.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   This struck me as a good topic for discussion. What do you do <br/>
to make<br/>
&gt; &gt;   sure a box is hidden as well (or better) than you found it? <br/>
