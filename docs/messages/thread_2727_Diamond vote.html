The Diamond feature is optional where the list is not. Since I don't<br/>
care for the list added to my clues, I have chosen to have my<br/>
letterboxes only in the LbNA database where this feature is optional.<br/>

Hi Feather<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe anyone has set down and described and listed <br/>
differences, but I'll give it a whirl.<br/>
<br/>
LbNA<br/>
Oldest North American site, maybe first web based clue site.<br/>
Basically a clue depository with a few counting features a planter <br/>
can turn off. Pretty much just nuts and bolts. Has been called a <br/>
Plain Jane, but many older letterboxers like the lack of bells and <br/>
whistles.<br/>
Has a "Contact the Placer" feature most letterboxers like. Home page <br/>
looks very interesting, with all the old looking stuff laying on the <br/>
desk. Clue pages look like old manuscripts.<br/>
<br/>
Atlas Quest<br/>
<br/>
The new kid on the block. Has tons of gimicky features. On line <br/>
logs,Profiles,talk boards, tons and tons of talk boards,more up to <br/>
date looking clue pages and other pages. Has some features, Blue <br/>
Diamonds(that can be turned off), finders listings(that can't be <br/>
turned off). Premium Memberships (that give the paying member a few <br/>
more things)but you do not have to pay to use most of the site. <br/>
While it is a clue depository as well, it seemingly is becoming more <br/>
of a chat based site and many new boxers seem to prefer its features.<br/>
Some clues are restricted to those with logged (at AQ) finds of 50 <br/>
or 100 finds.<br/>
<br/>
These are my own perceptions of each site.<br/>
<br/>
You can host clues at either site and link them to the other site or <br/>
keep separate clue sheets at both sites.<br/>
<br/>
We keep our clues hosted at LbNA and link them to AQ so that our <br/>
editing and maintenance processes are easier.<br/>
<br/>
There are other clue sites, but you have to find them for yourself. <br/>
Like some mystery boxes, the clues could be hidden anywhere.<br/>
