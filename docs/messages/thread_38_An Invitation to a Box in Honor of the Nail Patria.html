                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, April 1 marks the anniversary of the departure of my late <br>
father, Robert Nail.  <br>
Last summer the Nail Family placed the Titlow Beach Letterbox <br>
in West Tacoma in memory of him the same day we spread his <br>
ashes under the Narrows Bridge.  Many of you local letterboxers <br>
have  visited the box.  My thanks to Bethany, Fudrick, Hoopoe, Bill <br>
and Evil Glenn (still waiting for the video of the float test by the <br>
way), Sunseeker and DZ Dezi, Mischeif, Amanda, and His <br>
Emminence- Ryan for paying tribute.  Even a few travellers from <br>
the other coast visited.<br>
About a month ago it was reported that the log book was soaked <br>
(probably by a high tide) and we were quickly able to replace it.  <br>
<br>
I would like to take this opportunity to invite those who have not <br>
visited the box to please do so in honor of a very good man.  He <br>
is greatly missed.  Here is a link to the clues for the Titlow Beach <br>
Letterbox.  http://www.letterboxing.org/wa/nail.htm#titlow<br>
<br>
The Nail Family will be having a special toast to him with his <br>
favorite beverage, chocolate milk, this evening. If you feel so <br>
inclined, please have a glass as well<br>

When I was in Guatemala, my Spanish teacher and myself wandered down <br>
to a cemetery to look around, and one of the interesting things she <br>
told me was about a tradition that the indiginous people practice.  <br>
After a loved one passes away, they'll occasionally go back being the <br>
favorite food of whoever it was that passed away and have a picnic <br>
with it.  So if the deceased loved chicken, the family members would <br>
bring chicken.  If the deceased love bread, they would bring bread.<br>
<br>
I told my teacher that I didn't see any chicken bones or bread <br>
crumbs, but I did see a lot of beer cans laying around!<br>
<br>
I'll let you draw your own conclusions, though.  =)<br>
