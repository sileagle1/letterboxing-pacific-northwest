                    <div class="plaintext-content">This board is a bit different from the one I use in my work - it has<br/>
each post threaded so that replies and further discussion all come<br/>
under one posted topic and can all be viewed at once or skipped<br/>
entirely by skipping the entire thread.  One can mark a thread as a<br/>
favorite and be e-mailed any and all responses to it.  It is<br/>
considered rude not to come back and thank a person for answering your<br/>
question or responding to your post even if their answer didn't really<br/>
help you.  Here, on the other hand, it appears that one signs up for<br/>
e-mail of all posts or none, or a daily log of posts, receiving each<br/>
each and every post/reply, so I wonder if it is considered<br/>
"cluttering" to thank or otherwise make comments to those who respond<br/>
to any given post, seeings as that "thanking/responding" may not be<br/>
interesting at all to the group as a whole.  If I respond to someone's<br/>
response via their e-mail and the group does not see that response,<br/>
will it look like I'm rude and not following up on my post, or will<br/>
they be grateful I'm not cluttering the board up with stuff nobody but<br/>
one person is interested in?  Guidance please from those who have been<br/>
here a while.  <br/>

I wouldn't think you are rude if I don't see a <br/>

I also read this list online, in which case you can <br/>
set it up to be organized by thread. To do that <br/>
you click on Messages to the left and then at the <br/>

by thread. I have no idea if this is possible if you <br/>
receive the list via email. <br/>

There is one netiquette issue that I sometimes see<br/>

Likely, both. =) I for one am happy without the clutter, but some<br/>
people like to rush to judgements and will think you're rude for not<br/>
following up on a post. In a nutshell, it's impossible to make<br/>
everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note, just do what you think is right and you'll feel<br/>
good about yourself. =)<br/>
