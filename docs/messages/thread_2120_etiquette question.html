                    <div class="plaintext-content">This board is a bit different from the one I use in my work - it has<br>
each post threaded so that replies and further discussion all come<br>
under one posted topic and can all be viewed at once or skipped<br>
entirely by skipping the entire thread.  One can mark a thread as a<br>
favorite and be e-mailed any and all responses to it.  It is<br>
considered rude not to come back and thank a person for answering your<br>
question or responding to your post even if their answer didn't really<br>
help you.  Here, on the other hand, it appears that one signs up for<br>
e-mail of all posts or none, or a daily log of posts, receiving each<br>
each and every post/reply, so I wonder if it is considered<br>
"cluttering" to thank or otherwise make comments to those who respond<br>
to any given post, seeings as that "thanking/responding" may not be<br>
interesting at all to the group as a whole.  If I respond to someone's<br>
response via their e-mail and the group does not see that response,<br>
will it look like I'm rude and not following up on my post, or will<br>
they be grateful I'm not cluttering the board up with stuff nobody but<br>
one person is interested in?  Guidance please from those who have been<br>
here a while.  <br>

I wouldn't think you are rude if I don't see a <br>

<br>
I also read this list online, in which case you can <br>
set it up to be organized by thread. To do that <br>
you click on Messages to the left and then at the <br>

receive the list via email. <br>

There is one netiquette issue that I sometimes see<br>

quoted in the response, not just the relevant sections.<br>
Just my personal pet peeve...<br>

Likely, both. =) I for one am happy without the clutter, but some<br>
people like to rush to judgements and will think you're rude for not<br>
following up on a post. In a nutshell, it's impossible to make<br>
everyone happy.<br>
<br>
On a happier note, just do what you think is right and you'll feel<br>
good about yourself. =)<br>
