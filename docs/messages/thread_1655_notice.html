I don't think any of the boxes are a copy cat -- and I didn't mean copy cat<br>
in a bad way... I see Miller & Hutch, Lemoney Snicket, The Cloaked<br>
Letterboxer (and some other secret names I wont mention) sort of like the<br>
Spiderman, Batman, Superman, (insert other masked hero here) of<br>
letterboxing. I love looking for their boxes, they are ingenious and<br>
creative and by far some of the best letterboxes I have ever seen.  But I<br>
would enjoy them just as much if the clues were done in the same fashion and<br>
the people doing them were not hiding behind masks. I like knowing who is<br>
responsible for the wonderful and creative letterboxes I find and this<br>
masked man thing is just getting too trendy for me now.<br>
<br>
That's just my opinion though, it was not meant to allude bad things by the<br>
words "copy-cat" that is just what it is called when a trend like this<br>
starts. <br>

a Lemony Snicket box and go hunting boxes almost every weekend, rush out to<br>
nab the newest mystery box I just cracked and spend hours decoding and<br>
filling in the blanks.  <br>
<br>
Although admittedly I like Postal letterboxes - I like collecting the stamps<br>
from all sorts of different people and seeing what they are doing, I like<br>
the artwork aspect of it. -- And cooties -- I think they are awesome, I<br>
wanted something new and fun for the kids and they had a blast with them.<br>
Of course for someone that doesn't have kids and doesn't appreciate seeing<br>
them smile, and fall asleep with cooties in there hand it might seem silly.<br>
As long as it's a stamp, art and not in my F-count I'm cool with it.<br>

However, you ARE interested in mystery clues and boxes and cooties <br>
and all aspects of letterboxing? Then why the snide "copy cat" remark?<br>
<br>
I did notice that it was around 4 am when you made the original <br>
comment--perhaps you were just tired and out of sorts. Sometimes, we <br>
don't really say what we mean when we are up at all hours on the <br>
computer.<br>

being taken in a negative context. Perhaps I wrote it that way, if so I<br>
apologize. It was not meant that way. I was referring to the sociological<br>
definition of copy-cat any time something becomes a popular way of doing<br>
things and people jump on the band wagon it is called a copy-cat thing, be<br>
that smoking, suicide or in this case, using a "pen name". I wasn't putting<br>
anyone down; I was just trying to say that I too would like it if these<br>
mysterious people making these wonderful boxes would come out from behind<br>
their masks and plant the boxes as themselves.  What I have seen from these<br>
caped crusaders has been by far some of the best letterboxes I have ever<br>
seen. Lemony Snicket, the Cloaked Letterboxer, Miller and Hutch, they are<br>
all some of the most wonderful letterboxers ever.  But I would be even more<br>
impressed if I knew who they were. Like if I knew oh maybe that Amanda was<br>
Lemony Snicket, or that Der Mad Stamper was the Cloaked Letterboxer.  By all<br>
means please all of you keep putting out these wonderful boxes, mysterious<br>
and inventive and creative, put what ever slant you want on your boxes, be<br>
as creative as your imagination will allow, but don't always do it behind a<br>
mask is all I was trying to say.  Perhaps as Amanda said, it came out wrong<br>
