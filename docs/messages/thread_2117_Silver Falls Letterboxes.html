<br>
Seeing as it's going to be a very, very busy 4th of July weekend at<br>
Silver Falls, I'd like to request that you do NOT look for the Silver<br>
Falls series of boxes I planted a few years back. It's an extremely<br>
busy trail even on slow days and it would be absolutely impossible to<br>
be discreet on a busy weekend such as this one.<br>
<br>
I've removed the clues from the Internet for the time being, but if<br>
you've already printed out the clues, please do not bring them to the<br>
gathering.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
