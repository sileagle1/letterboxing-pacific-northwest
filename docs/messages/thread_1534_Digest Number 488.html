I live in Corvallis, which is right next( about 20 mi) to Lebannon.  If<br/>
you're coming from Salem(I5) you will want to take the last Albany exit<br/>
(past the airport) and take a left that is US-20.  Anyway, there aren't many<br/>
LB's in the corvallis Albany Area, I hope to remedy that... :-)  they are<br/>
mainly in the Corvallis area.  The LB's at EE. Wilson are fun  an easy to<br/>
get to.  There's only one now at Walnut park but you have to wander for a<br/>
while.  the one at Adair Village is also easy to find, but watch out for<br/>
Wasp nests.  If you have any questions let me know... I'm pretty familliar<br/>
with the area.<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay Ya'll - I'm heading south to a town called<br/>
&gt; Lebanon, OR on Monday, August 23.  I am VERY<br/>
&gt; unfamiliar with the towns I'll pass through or the<br/>
&gt; town of Lebanon itself.  I'm quite adventurous and<br/>
&gt; would like to be able to grab some boxes along the way<br/>
&gt; - despite the fact that I don't know where I'm going.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions for relatively easy finds?  No long<br/>
&gt; hikes (RYAN!) because with dropping kids off at camp<br/>
&gt; and such I don't have all day. Smile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It shows that I'll be going all the way to Salem and<br/>
&gt; then  onto US-20 toward Lebanon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, any suggestions of great finds are welcome.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are numerous boxes in the Corvallis/Philomath area. Mostly hidden by<br/>
just two people. Myself and Rat Pac. We have done our best to improve the<br/>
boxing in the area. The Peavy Arboretum boxes are awesome. I just picked<br/>
those up this weekend. There are actually 7 at Adair Village. The single box<br/>
I haven't gotten yet but the series is wonderful and the walk very nice.<br/>
(Read long) There used to be two at Walnut Park, but mine there came up<br/>
missing. I have yet to replace it. There are also three in the Philomath<br/>
City Park.<br/>
<br/>
And of course we'd love to invite everyone from the South Valley to come up<br/>
for the Passport to Letterboxing stamp camp August 28th. Saturday is going<br/>
to be a full day of fun classes, exchanges, boxes, and raffles! Come and<br/>
join the fun.<br/>
