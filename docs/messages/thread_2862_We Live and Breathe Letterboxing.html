<br/>
Der Mad Stamper and friends have a few announcements to make about <br/>
the `We Live and Breathe Letterboxing' event that you will want to be <br/>
aware of... <br/>
<br/>
First, and most important, we have changed the date of the event to <br/>
Friday, September 12th, through Sunday, September 14th, 2008. This is <br/>
now a firm date and you can begin to make your plans with confidence. <br/>
<br/>
Another change with less impact to you is a change of venue. We <br/>
became very concerned with the lack of professionalism exhibited by <br/>
the staff at Camp Namanu. The good news is that we have an even <br/>
better site now and, in retrospect, probably should have been there <br/>
all along. <br/>
<br/>
The event will be held at Camp Adams in Molalla, Oregon, which is <br/>
about 35 miles south of Portland. This is a residential camp with <br/>
heated cabins and 210 acres of forested trails. We are very excited <br/>
about the new venue and will give you more information about this <br/>
fantastic camp in the near future. <br/>
<br/>
We know you have been patiently waiting for more information with <br/>
regard to the cost of the event. We are currently working on getting <br/>
our final pricing together and getting the registration form up on <br/>
the website. In the meantime, we can only give you a very rough <br/>
estimate of $150 per person for the entire three-day weekend. This <br/>
would include room, board and all activities for the event. We are <br/>
hopeful the final price will be less, but wanted you to have some <br/>
idea for your budgeting purposes. Again, we will get more information <br/>
and our final pricing to you soon. The very latest updates will <br/>
always be available at www.mitchklink.com/letterboxing/retreat.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, to avoid the possibility of miscommunication, we have <br/>
created an email account (weliveandbreathe@yahoo.com) which is the <br/>
one and only official contact address for the event. Please direct <br/>
all questions and comments to that address.<br/>
<br/>
This still promises to be the letterboxing event of the decade! We <br/>
promise it's going to be a letterboxing get-away unlike anything <br/>
you've ever experienced before. We're looking forward to seeing you <br/>
all at the event!<br/>
<br/>

I just popped in to check how our friends Wood Aug, and Kurious Jo <br/>
and anyone else who are in the vicinity of the flooding and I came <br/>
across this event. Hope you are all okay.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like an awesome opportunity! wow!<br/>
I will check with the family, and then see if some of our American <br/>
PNW friends might be at this event.<br/>
Take care.<br/>
