<br>
We will be travelling to Idaho and around Washington state and would like to<br>
meet up with some boxers.  We could go letterboxing, share a meal or just<br>
exchange.  Whatever!  We'd enjoy meeting you! <br>
<br>
We'll be in Richland  August 22nd - 24th.  We could meet you the evening of<br>
the 23rd, at Atomic Brew Pub.  Say around 6 or 7-ish to whenever?  There's a<br>
lot of boxers in the Tri-cities we'd like to meet!  After that we head to<br>
Coeur d'Alene for the Northern ID/Eastern WA gathering on Saturday the 25th.<br>
We'll be camping at Wolf Lodge Campground from the 24th - 26th.  Look for a<br>
largish picture of the LbNA patch on the RV windshield and if that fails<br>
look for a dark blue Honda CR-V.  In Leavenworth the 26th - 29th we're at<br>
Pine Village KOA and Bothell the 31st - 2nd at Lake Pleasant RV Park.  Then<br>
we'll be around Montesano the 2nd  - 4th.  Any boxers in that area that want<br>
to meet Monday night somewhere?  We're not familiar with the restaurants and<br>
parks in most of these areas we're going so suggestions are welcome.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Feel free to email me either directly or through Atlas Quest.  We expect to<br>
have internet access - at the campgrounds mentioned above.   <br>
<br>
