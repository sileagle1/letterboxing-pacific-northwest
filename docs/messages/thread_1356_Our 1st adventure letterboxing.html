What a fun, fun adventure.  My 8 yr old has already thought of a <br>

letterboxes in your area.  Since you know where you live better than anyone, if you got to the LbNA website, <br>
http://www.letterboxing.org and search for boxes in Washington State, you'll get a better feel for it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Chari!  Welcome to letterboxing!<br>
<br>
I'm very glad to hear you found my Mukilteo box.  I havn't had a chance to <br>
check on it recently and I'm glad to hear it's alive and well.<br>
<br>
I got a short list of boxes I'd recommend if you don't mind driving a bit <br>
south.<br>
<br>
Honey Pot at St Edwards Park (Kirkland)<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=3933&boxname=Honey_Pot_@_St._Edward's<br>
I visited this one this weekend and it'd alive and well.  This great one for <br>
kids as there's this REALLY great playgroud right at the trail head.<br>
<br>
BBTC Bridge at St Edwards Park (Kirkland)<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=3756&boxname=St._Edward's_BBTC_Bridge_Box<br>
This one is in the same park as the previous box and was doing well when I <br>
found it last weekend.  It's a nice walk that little ones can manage.  Keep <br>
your eyes open for the bikers.  =D<br>
<br>
Redmond Watershed Preserve (Redmond)<br>
http://home1.gte.net/res0fpfm/letterboxes/redmond.htm<br>
This one is another of mine.  Two boxes on this hike and seems to be very <br>
popular with beginning letterboxers.  =D<br>
<br>
And if you can manage it at all, you should come join us at our Meet and <br>
Greet this Saturday.  It's sure to be loads of fun and I expect there will <br>
be a lot of little ones to play with too.  =)<br>
