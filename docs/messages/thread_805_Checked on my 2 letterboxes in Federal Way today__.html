did state that we took our dog with us when we went to that park, NO where<br/>
did I state that I brought my dog into that park.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, perhaps you need to back off and not assume things. I've no<br/>
idea why the first person in this chain of letters brought their dog into<br/>
the park, but, just for the record, my fiance and son stayed at the car<br/>
with the dog as my daughter and I went into the park after the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Notice in that statement, please, no indication that said dog was allowed<br/>
into the park, nor is there any indication that I routinely ignore rules<br/>
such as NO dogs allowed.<br/>
<br/>
I'll say this much, it's jerks like you that make mailing lists tiresome to<br/>
say the least.<br/>

You set an example for your kid and their friend. If the rules are inconvenient make a lame excuse and one can ignore them. Leashed, sedate and portly on the boardwalk are all lame excuses because you think you are above these rules. Do you call this actions good parenting? Is this an example of the respect to show our Nature Preserves? Is this how you want LBers to be remembered? Call me a jackass again. It doesn't change the facts of what you did and what you did sucks. <br/>

  My leashed, sedate and portly dog stayed on the boardwalk at all <br/>
  times, and methinks your moniker should be "jackass" instead <br/>
  of "Evil".<br/>

  &gt; Did you have the kids along? How did you explain to them why you <br/>

  skills you have.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Sorry but you folks really piss me off taking animals in to a <br/>

&gt;On another note-I'd like to say that mean people who say rude things <br/>
&gt;for pointless reasons in public forums really annoy me. <br/>
<br/>
Jeez. I haven't had time to read the list for awhile (new Border Collie puppy  = no time to read email) and now I find I've missed all this juicy conversation!!! Rats. (:  Looks like I missed a bunch at LBNA, too. Double rats. <br/>
<br/>
This is WAY better than office gossip (something I miss since starting to work from home)!<br/>
