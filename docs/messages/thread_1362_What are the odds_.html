Yup....during my mad dash to Yuma, Arizona with my dad and niece we <br/>
ran into Ryan and Amanda on the trail from/to the Laughlin Carp <br/>
Letterbox. We were leaving and they were going. We knew that they <br/>
had been in the area earlier in the day when we found the Hoover Dam <br/>
box (75 miles away) had been visited by them that morning. We were <br/>
at Hoover Dam around 1:30/2:30pm and they had already been there. So <br/>
after spending 30 minutes looking for the Laughlin Carp and finally <br/>
finding it (I forgot the compass so we hiked back to the car and <br/>
drove over to the general area) without the compass after all. We <br/>
were driving down the road and saw two people walking down the side <br/>
of the road that looked like they were counting paces/steps and one <br/>
was wearing a compass! Hmm..dead giveaway with the compass....so we <br/>
whipped a U-turn and pulled up alongside them. Hollered out the <br/>
window..."Amanda" and sure enough it was her and Ryan! So..we <br/>
quickly exchanged stamps (roadside) and got some <br/>
updates...hmm...forgot to ask why they were together in Vegas..just <br/>
assumed checking on letterboxes...failed to notice if there was any <br/>
jewelry on those left ring fingers..didn't even think of that until <br/>
after we left them to go find the box.  <br/>
<br/>
It was so fun actually meeting someone I "know of" on the trail and <br/>
even more funner considering it was my first time letterboxing out <br/>
of the WA/OR area.<br/>
<br/>
I had to immediately call MomNoTime from my cell phone to tell her <br/>
the news!! She about fell over when I told her. What are the odds?<br/>

him.  We figured it was because the trail was under 2-1/2' of snow <br/>
when we were there--in MAY!!!  This is also the reason we only found <br/>
the first box in the series--we didn't have our crampons and ice <br/>
picks with us at the time.  We did pass a 'gem' hunter tapping on <br/>
agates in the creek along the way.  Who else would be crazy enough <br/>
to be out in those conditions besides letterboxers &amp; treasure <br/>
hunters???  ;)<br/>

There was some naked and partially naked hiking going on at the <br/>
Arizona Hot Springs, but that's not particularly unexpected near hot <br/>
springs.  Happens a lot, really.  =)<br/>

As for the unexpected meet up in Laughlin--the odds had to be <br/>
enormous!  I was certainly surprised at the unexpected turn of <br/>
events!  What a great suprise, though.  =)<br/>

In another news, the only reason Amanda and I were in Vegas together <br/>
was because that's the only airport in the area her airline flies <br/>
to.  Any rumors of marriage can be put to rest.<br/>

Just for the record....I never tease cruelly nor to start rumors...I <br/>
dearly hope that no one took it that way...It was totally in fun as <br/>
there is always the joke about people actually taking off to Vegas to <br/>
elope...If I've offended anyone with my joke I apologize. Hmmm...lets <br/>
see...if rumors persist about your status continue to fly you could <br/>
just fool everyone by holding a huge "letterboxers FAUX wedding" <br/>
Event...June is always a good month for weddings real or not real!<br/>
LOL!!! Just think of all the stuff you could create around that!! It <br/>
would serve me right too!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Heck you got out of there better off than I did...those darn nickel <br/>
slots took me for an entire whopping $6.45! But the BlackJack table <br/>
was better to my dad. In one hand he won $175 and immediately <br/>
quit...it paid for all our food on the trip!!  He also really enjoyed <br/>
getting a taste of letterboxing on the trip. In fact he says that if <br/>
there are any boxes around the areas he goes to he may just seek them <br/>
out. Unfortunately there aren't many in the middle of the Game <br/>
Management Units he frequents nor in Yakima when he is there for <br/>
Dept. of Game &amp; Wildlife meetings. Maybe I'll see if he wants to tag <br/>
along for an event. Of course that means that I'll have to carve him <br/>
a stamp and create a logbook.<br/>
<br/>
We did manage to get out of the Desert without any tangles with any <br/>
creepy crawlies...but I do have to admit to killing a rattler (or <br/>
maybe it was a sidewinder) on the way to Yuma...it was crawling <br/>
across the road and I wasn't able to swerve in time. So I had my <br/>
first "roadkill" experience. UGH!!!<br/>
