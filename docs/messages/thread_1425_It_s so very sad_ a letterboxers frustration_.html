                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I can only assume that you are talking about Camp Fire Lady and I and<br/>
the Here Kitty Kitty Boxes - So I will step up to the podium and comment. I<br/>
don't care if you don't name names - I'd rather you did - I find it<br/>
distasteful to make a post like this anyways - if you had a real problem<br/>
with it perhaps you should have emailed one of us directly and we could have<br/>
discussed this privately, but since you have put it out for discussion<br/>
amongst the group, let's discussed it a bit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using this example - Camp Fire Lady placed her boxes on July 1st and gave me<br/>
the clues to beta test them.  This has become a pretty common thing in our<br/>
little group, I give clues to Maiden and Camp Fire Lady sometimes as well<br/>
before posting them on the main board to make sure that there are no<br/>
problems with the clues.  Iron`Bear, Sim Kitty and I headed out to box with<br/>
Camp Fire Lady in the Battleground/Vancouver area on the third. We hit about<br/>
18 boxes that day, including boxes by Funhog, Soggy2Pair, Team Nashoba and<br/>
Camp Fire Lady herself. (We got the Bookworm Letterbox also after trying to<br/>
figure out the clues for several months) - Since I had the clues for her<br/>
Here Kitty Kitty in order to beta test them we decided to hit those too. And<br/>
since I had Sim Kitty with me (who unlike most people's kids doesn't get to<br/>
go with us all the time as we only have her every other weekend or so) and<br/>
she has a fierce love of cats we saved the Here Kitty Kitty series until the<br/>
last thing we did that day and used it to celebrate her 50th find, letting<br/>
her find a box or two, run around the park and so on.  So the box obviously<br/>
counted as a find for me and for Sim Kitty and the firstie was well deserved<br/>
and was split between me and Sim Kitty - a little 7-year-old girl that's<br/>
never got a firstie before and who got rewarded with a new letterboxing<br/>
journal - a real one instead of the little notepad she was using as an<br/>
incentive for her effort and accomplishment in getting 50 boxes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are all sorts of things people do with their clues - heck I have clues<br/>
to letterboxes you don't even get unless you get them from me personally<br/>
meaning unless I want you to have them! I post my clues after some people<br/>
have found them.  Heck I made my firstie prizes, I made my letterbox, I<br/>
planted it, if I want to give someone the clues and let them go get it<br/>
before I post the clues to the main board that is totally up to me. I'm the<br/>
one that spent the time and money on it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many other letter boxers do the same thing Willow - perhaps if you planted a<br/>
box or two you would decide to do the same thing also.  I know I have heard<br/>
Ryan and Amanda talk before about how Ryan plants a box while Amanda is off<br/>
somewhere else planting one or something and then Ryan gives her the clues<br/>
and she goes for his. There is an entire topic on beta testing going on a<br/>
different list right now and what a wonderful idea it is.  Heck both Maiden<br/>
and Camp Fire Lady found errors in my recent clues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I like getting the firstie prizes too, just because I think they<br/>
are cool and make a neat decoration for my log book, especially Camp Fire<br/>
Lady's with her little shrinky dinks - but firsties is not what letterboxing<br/>
is about - its another one of those added little bonuses. Most people don't<br/>
even put first finder prizes in their letterboxes. Heck I've had firsties on<br/>
tons of letterboxes and got nothing in return. Personally I don't throw a<br/>
temper tantrum if I don't pick up the firstie prize, for me it's about<br/>
finding the box.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are right about one thing Willow I do pride myself on following the<br/>
rules of the hunt and the game, but there is no rule saying my friends can't<br/>
test my boxes or find my boxes before you, or that I can't give one group of<br/>
people the clues before another, has for my "preaching" on the board - I<br/>
don't even post that much anymore since I left the main list, mainly because<br/>
I got tired of attitudes just like yours.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shame on us Willow? Shame on you is more like it - you're childlike temper<br/>
tantrum and need to publicly slap at people for doing something you don't<br/>
like because you got greedy without having the information before hand is<br/>
insulting. I tell you what - so that you are not so offended and don't feel<br/>
like you are getting the "wrath" that you are so willingly handing out to<br/>
people, the next time I find a box with a firstie prize in it, in your area,<br/>
I will write on the back "Please don't take this pandora is leaving it for<br/>
Willow" and we can call it even.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Posts like this and you wonder why you are opening cans of worms?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps your frustration,<br/>

   I don't understand why you chose to air this on the group list. If <br/>
you have a problem with any of my boxes I wish you would have called <br/>
me. You have my email address as well as my phone number. The way I <br/>
see it, these are my letterboxes that I created and payed for so I <br/>
feel that I should be able to handle them the way I want and not have <br/>
to explain to someone why I wanted to have another letterboxer check <br/>
the clues to make sure they were correct. As it turned out there were <br/>
a few mistakes in the clues that were changed before the clues were <br/>
posted and I am grateful to Pandora for checking them for me. It is <br/>
sad that now I feel that I need to pull all of my Firsties and never <br/>
put anymore into my boxes because someone whined because they didn't <br/>
get them first. There were other "gifts" in that series of boxes that <br/>
I am sure you picked up. Why couldn't they have been enough for you? <br/>
Maybe if you would plant a few boxes of your own you would understand <br/>
how much thought and work goes into creating a letterbox and you <br/>
would do all that you can to make sure that the box is exactly the <br/>
way that you want it. You are so worried about "opening another can <br/>
of worms" on the group list but you feel that you need to post this <br/>
to both the LbPNW and the letterboxing usa site. What is your <br/>
reasoning behind this? What are you trying to start Cherie? You would <br/>
think that "friends" would talk to each other first. I am hurt by <br/>
this.<br/>

Willow felt upset--justified or not doesn't really matter--about not <br/>
being the first finder.  Expressing her feelings isn't a bad thing.  <br/>
I for one had no idea that not being a first finder would upset <br/>

I understand Willows frustration especially when you find boxes where the first person to find it leaves messages that are rude to say the least (Ha! Ha! I got firsties) I don't care about being first but I would like to be treated fairly. From Pandora's e-mail I gather that letterboxing is very clickie and only people in the inter circle get treated equally. I think having someone check your clues is a great idea but I don't believe that person should be considered the first one to find the box , they are just assisting the person the planted the box. I don't think the real issue here is who gets the firstie or how many boxes you find first, it's that fair play and being treated with respect and consideration is what we all want. Thank you Willow for bring this to my attention , I have a differ view of letterboxing after reading the postings that responded to you.  <br/>

Letterboxing is no more 'clickie' than any other group.  The 'inner <br/>
circle' is just a matter of perspective.  I feel like I'm in <br/>
the 'outer circle' when it comes to certain groups, and part of <br/>
the 'inner circle' with other people.<br/>
<br/>
Let's discuss matters openly and fairly--not degenerate into us vs. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with Ryan totally on this one.  And taking my personal experience<br/>
out of it I agree that everyone should be treated fairly and equally, that<br/>
is one of the things I have always said when I was a member of the big list.<br/>
I don't believe in elitism or casting other people out.  The reason that I<br/>
even stepped up and explained this situation was because I felt there was<br/>
something to be gained by it. Each person's perception is their reality, and<br/>
sometimes the way we perceive things is not the same as the way they<br/>
actually happened when the people that were involved were there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I care about everyone's feelings and I am sorry anyone's feelings got hurt,<br/>
I truly am.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think Ryan is right though you are going to find clicks wherever you go,<br/>
whatever hobby you do and I think that is justified to some extent, friends<br/>
tend to hang out and do things together, and there is no harm in that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to the matter of if you are beta testing clues for someone you didn't<br/>
actually find the box, well I'm sorry I disagree, I did the same thing<br/>
anyone else did to find the box, I followed the clues and got to the box,<br/>
and in actuality in some cases, I think the beta test does even more work.<br/>
Maiden just recently beta tested some of my boxes and I know that she had to<br/>
figure out where I had messed up my right and my left and search even harder<br/>
than everyone else will have to because I was able to alter the clues so<br/>
that they give you the correct directions after having someone else out<br/>
there.  I wasn't there when she found it, I didn't help her, so in my<br/>
opinion that still counts as a find, she did not assist me in planting it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am personally of the opinion that my clues are mine and that I can<br/>
disperse them how I wish to do it. The letterbox is there for people who<br/>
want to find it to find it once I make the clues public, but what I do with<br/>
it before that is up to me, as it is up to the owner of any box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing we all need to keep in mine when we are dealing with<br/>
emotions, and I include myself in this as well because I'm guilty of it<br/>
myself, is that we need to really consider what we say on the boards when we<br/>
are responding based on emotion.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In honestly I am sorry Willow felt so slighted by my family finding those<br/>
boxes first, I don't agree with it, but I am sorry you felt that way.  I'm<br/>
sorry that Camp Fire Lady's feelings are hurt also, as I hate seeing a dear<br/>
friend of mine sad and I am sorry to anyone else that felt that my response<br/>
made letterboxing seem "unfair."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all continue to box, whether or not you get firsties on boxes.  I<br/>
know that for me personally it is not about the firstie prize or the who got<br/>
there before me, it's just about finding the box and doing something I love<br/>
with someone I love. I like being out on the trails and hunting down boxes<br/>
with Iron`Bear.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all well,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From Pandora's e-mail I gather that letterboxing is very clickie<br/>
&gt; and only people in the inter circle get treated equally.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is no more 'clickie' than any other group.  The 'inner <br/>
circle' is just a matter of perspective.  I feel like I'm in <br/>
the 'outer circle' when it comes to certain groups, and part of <br/>
the 'inner circle' with other people.<br/>
<br/>
Let's discuss matters openly and fairly--not degenerate into us vs. <br/>
them.  That's how clicks begin.  I've met all of the people invovled <br/>
with this 'incident' and all of them are nice, thoughtful people that <br/>
bring a lot letterboxing.<br/>

Amen!<br/>
I believe the clues and letterboxes are owned by the placer before, <br/>
after,during creation, while residing in a location, and during the <br/>
period that it is posted for public finding. The placer has complete <br/>
discretion at their whim whether to pull the clues or post the clues.<br/>
Finders can search for letterboxes only when clues are furnished by <br/>
placers in what ever form they choose, whether it be listed on LBNA, <br/>
other sites or by word of mouth. I'm sure that there are several <br/>
placers that use letterboxes as a gift(see Appology on the main list <br/>
for an example), and these letterboxes may or may not reach a public <br/>
arena. Gwen and I don't use first Finder certs, and really don't <br/>
care to put our letterboxes out just to increase someone's F count. <br/>
We are only concerned about the location, and the experience we are <br/>
leading you to in our letterboxes. Hopefully you will find the <br/>
letterbox , but if you don't then enjoy the moment. <br/>

first finder awards I have decided to no longer offer awards or <br/>
prizes of any kind in my letterboxes. I had worked hard to create <br/>
them and spent money on these items to add a little extra to the <br/>
boxes but if they are going to be fought over it is just not worth <br/>
the effort. Nor will I take any first finder awards from boxes that I <br/>
find either. I would hate to be labeled a "thief" or be accused of <br/>
doing something that is unethical. That is not the reason that I go <br/>
letterboxing in the first place. <br/>

<br/>
What?!  No way!  I heard that joke LONG before I ever met you!  :P  I <br/>
was 'stealth camping' with some friends just outside of Yosemite NP <br/>
and one of my friends told it to me.  (This was back when I was <br/>
living in California and still in school!)  And Shawn (that was the <br/>
name of the guy who told me the joke) tells the joke, just as we were <br/>
all going to sleep.  I kind of rolled my eyes and went to sleep--what <br/>
a dumb joke!<br/>
<br/>
But then I got this image of a burning duck, and an elephant <br/>
frantically trying to put the fire out on the burning duck.  It <br/>
seemed almost like a cartoon in my head, and I started giggling over <br/>
it.  Everyone else is trying to sleep, mind you, and I tried to <br/>
stiffle the laughing.  Which, everyone knows, is absolutely <br/>
impossible to do--it just makes things worse.<br/>
<br/>
By the time someone finally woke up and asked me what I was laughing <br/>
at, I could hardly breath from laughing so hard.  Tears coming out of <br/>
my eyes.  And I tried to say what I was laughing <br/>
at: "bur...burning....  d...  daa... ducks......"  *clutching sides <br/>
in laughter.<br/>
<br/>
Man, I must have laughed for a half hour, and it darned near killed <br/>
me.  You NEVER forget a joke like that!  =)<br/>

- laughing fits are sooooo funny. Glad you shared, for some reason Ryan I<br/>
just never imagined you rolling in laughter - you seem too quiet and serious<br/>
when you are around people I guess.<br/>

I've only seen you be funny in text. :-)<br/>
