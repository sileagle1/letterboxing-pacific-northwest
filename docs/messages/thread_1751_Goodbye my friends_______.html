                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to personally thank each and every person that came to wish me <br/>
off to Alaska at Izzys yesterday. The stamp was awesome, the food was <br/>
great and the friendship was overwhelming. It meant more than you'll <br/>
ever know to heave you guys throw something like that for me.  Each one <br/>
of you is special to me and will not be forgotten.  To those that <br/>
couldn't make it, but sent their best wishes, I can't thank you enough <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
To those that didn't make it, but wished they did, if you will take a <br/>
single sheet of paper 7x5 and stamp your signature stamp on it, (In <br/>
landscape mode not portrait mode) and just a few thoughts on it and mail <br/>
it to RayvenMom (Getting the snail mail address by writing to her at <br/>
rayvenmom at lbworld dot org) and she'll return mail you the stamp image <br/>
made by Team Chaos.<br/>
<br/>
I'll get pictures of the area uploaded as soon as I can when I get there <br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
