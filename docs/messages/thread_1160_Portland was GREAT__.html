<br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who helped make my trip <br/>
so very memorable. I appreciate those who came out to visit and <br/>
exchange (geez oh pizza ... some of you drove for hours!) How great <br/>
it was to get to know some of you a bit better, thanks for letting <br/>
me into your lives. I had so much fun boxing with everyone and am so <br/>
sorry to have missed Paisley Orca and Carrie!!<br/>
<br/>
I just love the PNW ... breathtakinginly beautiful! friendly, <br/>
kindhearted people and amazing letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
My logbook has so many new images and so many FIRSTS!! I'm no longer <br/>
an "exchange virgin" ... no longer a "cuckoo clue virgin" ... no <br/>
longer a "mystery clue virgin" ... no longer a "micro-box <br/>
virgin" ... and no longer an "event stamp virgin" !!! Woo-hoo!!  <br/>
<br/>
Bindle Bum is being very good about it, but I can tell he's envious.<br/>
<br/>
I uploaded just a few of the pictures I took.  In case anyone wants <br/>
to take a peek, they're in the album called PORTLAND TRIP at:<br/>
www.picturetrail.com/bindle_boxers<br/>
<br/>
More later ... laundry is calling my name (grin) and I have to pack <br/>
for our trip to FLA.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
PS: Sorry it took so long to report in, but I spend Saturday night <br/>
packing up all my art stuff from the retreat .... how come it USED <br/>
to fit into the two bags I brought and now it doesn't? LOL!!  I had <br/>
to be at PDX by 4:30am to jump through the security hoops before <br/>
catching my flight home. When we got to Chicago there were some <br/>
difficulties with the airline, resulting in hours and hours of <br/>
delay ... poor Bindle Bum had been waiting at the airport to pick me <br/>
up since 3pm and I think my flight finally landed around 9pm. It was <br/>
a very long day for me so I went right to bed instead of sending my <br/>
report last night.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yup....We had a blast on our quick trip south to meet up with <br/>
BindleBabe and the rest of the gals!! When we were in the middle of <br/>
Mary Scott Rec Area we realized it was an all girl day of boxing!! <br/>
Too Funny!<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick update on the MultiHound Canine Collection! The stinging <br/>
nettle is beginning to sprout in the area! I found it out the hard <br/>
way when placing Rex back in his den. The log has a ton of nettle <br/>
sprouting around it at the moment. I can pretty much guarantee that <br/>
anyone reaching in to retrieve the box will get stung! I know I did! <br/>
But if you doget stung - there are plenty of broadleaf ferns growing <br/>
around the area to rub on the affected skin to relieve the pain!<br/>
<br/>
As MomNoTime said in her post...we had a blast! We are planning on <br/>
highjacking my husbands KingCab pickup and heading down south with <br/>
the kids in June. I think that due to the kid factor we will do the <br/>
boxes in and around the Zoo. Since none of us have been there to <br/>
visit the zoo..actually I think my daughter did once with grandma <br/>
several years ago!<br/>
<br/>
Had a blast meeting everyone and we even got a photo or two taken. <br/>
Maybe someone will post them in the photo section!<br/>
<br/>
Til later,<br/>
