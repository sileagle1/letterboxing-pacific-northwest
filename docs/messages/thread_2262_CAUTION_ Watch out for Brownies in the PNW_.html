the PNW.<br/>
<br/>
Just a note of warning, I have found a couple of Hitchhikers in the <br/>
past few days in letterboxes where the hitchhiker log was put in the <br/>
ziplock with the letterbox log and the hitchhiker stamp was put in a <br/>
ziplock with the letterbox stamp. Luckily, the letterbox and <br/>
hitchhiker were nothing alike (and had been stamped into their <br/>
original logs) and I could figure out who went where.<br/>
<br/>
The last folks to stamp into both logs were a Brownie Troop. Troop <br/>
927.  <br/>
<br/>
The One Hitchhiker even had it's own Ziplock with Hitchhiker written <br/>
all over it (at least this was still in the letterbox)<br/>
<br/>
Now to give the Brownies credit, all 12 of them signed into ONE PAGE! <br/>
Hurrah!!! <br/>
<br/>
But the logs and stamps could very easily get confused. So if you are <br/>
a letterboxer and find this situation, please take extra care to make <br/>
sure that the correct Log and Stamp stay with the letterbox and the <br/>
correct Log and Stamp that are a Hitchhiker leave with you. This is <br/>
especially trying when you have a Honey Bee HH hidden in a Honey Bee <br/>
Letterbox! :-)<br/>
