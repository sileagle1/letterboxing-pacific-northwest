<br>
I'm thinking it's not out of line (or too helpful, either ;o) to suggest that <br>
one way to find out what veteran letterboxers already know about a subject is <br>
to search the archives on the main list.  (To do this, you can go to the LB <br>
website, click on "talk list" and then on "talk list archive.")  It is rather <br>
laborious to search the archives--and in this case doesn't seem to reveal <br>
anything that's gotten me anywhere--but maybe you'll have greater insight!  Good <br>
luck!<br>
