together! I enjoyed meeting all the new letterboxers in the area and <br/>
seeing some old faces as well.<br/>
Cat's Meow would like to thank everyone that contributed their carvings <br/>
to her Camp Fire Torchbearer project and especially Der Mad Stamper for <br/>
being such a sport and letting her interview her favorite artist. Who <br/>
would have thought that such a fun hobby could be considered such an <br/>
art form that it is considered a Creative Art and used as an example to <br/>
earn a project award for a youth organization.<br/>
Little Foot and Coyote had such a wonderful time at their first <br/>
gathering that even though we were soaked to the bone while trying to <br/>
find the remaining 2 boxes of the Dark Side, they wanted to find more <br/>
on the way home. Thank you all for making this so much fun for us and I <br/>
look forward to seeing you all again soon on the trails!<br/>

Ditto that for me too - I hauled my RV over there Friday and boxed in<br/>
the deluge until it got dark and really couldn't imagine an event<br/>
going on in that weather - this being my first event, I thought I<br/>
better drive up to the picnic area Saturday morning just to make sure.<br/>
 Imagine my surprise to find them there all set up and ready to go.  I<br/>
was VERY impressed that they would not only be there but at the<br/>
obvious planning and time spent on it; I enjoyed the day thoroughly,<br/>
as I know did the others present.  Also enjoyed the thunderstorm later<br/>
in the day but was fortunately inside taking a letterboxing break<br/>
rather than tromping the trails.  Thanks again you two for a lovely day.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, man, this gathering was so much fun. It's the first time I really<br/>
tried to nab as many boxes as I possibily could in a short period of<br/>
time. Some of the boxes that I found that weren't well camoflauged I<br/>
made an effort to rehide MUCH better to help thwart those who dared to<br/>
follow in my footsteps. ;o) I just felt so sneaky. You could have even<br/>
caught me running (running! I NEVER run!) at times to the next box. <br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a grand good time. Even if I didn't win, it would<br/>
have been tons of fun. (I did win, but even if I didn't it would have<br/>
been fun!)<br/>
<br/>
That's dedication--planting and carving 53 boxes just for the poker<br/>
run! I do hope this type of event happens again in the future!<br/>

that a candle is my whisky holder? Hmm....<br/>
