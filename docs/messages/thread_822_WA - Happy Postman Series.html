                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm happy to report that the Happy Postman Series is alive and well.  I finally dragged my hubby and the dogs  out to Lewisville Park this afternoon for a bit of letterboxing.  What a wonderful park!  I never would have gone here if not for the Happy Postman Series.  We will definitely be back to this park again, and not just to find the Lewisville Mini-Scramble box (didn't have the clues with me!).<br>
<br>
Camp Fire Lady, these stamps are wonderful!  Thank you for a most enjoyable hunt.  The mail was fun to read and I enjoyed the story aspect of the clues.  All your boxes were in good shape.  A bit damp on the outside on a couple but nice and dry on the inside where it counts.  All were well hidden.<br>
<br>
If ya'll haven't made it out to hunt for this new series, I highly encourage it.  While the path has some hilly areas, it would be a good one for families, even if one has a stroller.  Lots of people using the paths there today, but no letterboxers that I saw.  <br>

on them soon but it looks like I don't need to at the moment. <br>
Lewisville Park is a beautiful park and I am glad you enjoyed the <br>
series. See you at Fright Fest!<br>
