<br>
LadyB & MonkeyBoy are still here. Thanks to you I am carving more <br>
intricate things than I ever imagined!<br>
<br>
Topics: Let's see how about:<br>
 Nifty tools and where to get them, tips & tricks to using them. I've <br>
heard mention of light/magnifier and needles.<br>
(I just bought the backpack stool off ebay that was mentioned on the <br>
big list - sounded handy)<br>
 Good boxes to get when it's rainy out - possibly indoor, sheltered, <br>
fun virtual ones<br>
 Ideas/styles/tips/advice on making log books<br>
 Who does Postals? more about them.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of us newbies who'd love to learn more so this could be <br>
really great!<br>
I'm sure there are probably lots of other ideas that experienced and <br>
newbies would be interested in. Please share!<br>
<br>
Great idea Funhog!<br>
LadyB<br>
