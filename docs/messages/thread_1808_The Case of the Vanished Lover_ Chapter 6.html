Chapter 6<br/>
<br/>
Monday morning. I awoke at 5:48am from a fitful night of sleep.  I had<br/>
had a very strange dream. I dreamt that I was I was in the cab of a<br/>
steam train engine with Buddy.  The train was pulling several flat<br/>
cars loaded with loggers riding to work in the forest. Each man had an<br/>
axe or saw in his hands. We were riding along the rail line headed<br/>
into the Black Hills.  We turned a corner and I could see that we were<br/>
headed toward a tunnel in the side of a hill. I glanced back to the<br/>
flat cars and all the loggers were putting on miners helmets with<br/>
lights on them and their axes and saws had become picks and shovels.<br/>
As soon as we went into the tunnel it became pitch dark except for the<br/>
lights of the miners helmets.  Suddenly the train stopped inside the<br/>
tunnel.  I turned to Buddy and he was not there.  In his place was a<br/>
cow that said, "Death contract.  Come, Enigma, help me repair the<br/>
tunnel." Then I heard the horrible sound of the tunnel collapsing and<br/>
the screams of the men and the mooing of the cow and I awoke.<br/>
<br/>
Dreams. They rarely mean anything other than what you ate the night<br/>
before was undercooked or overspiced. I put no stock in dreams. Real<br/>
detective work took shoe leather and lots of research. I was<br/>
determined to not let the dream bother me. Still, the image of a cow<br/>
speaking to me like my grandfather stuck in the back of my mind and<br/>
made me shiver. Or was it just that I had left the window cracked to<br/>
clear the room of the smoke from my burnt dinner the night before.<br/>
<br/>
It was still dark when I got up and ready for the day's<br/>
investigations. I would need to go by the bank and exchange some of<br/>
the gold coins for paper bills.  There is a certain satisfaction in<br/>
feeling to the heft of gold coins in a pocket but they don't spend<br/>
very easily. I also needed to go back by the maritime museum and get<br/>
the transcribed notes on the Escalate, Geraldson Corporation, and Sam<br/>
McCaw from Laurel. I also planned to visit the regional office of<br/>
Geraldson Corporation and snoop around a little and see what I could<br/>
come up with. However, I didnt want to arouse too much suspicion so I<br/>
decided to pull out an old alias that I used from time to time to<br/>
assist in these kid of undercover investigations. I would need to go<br/>
to the office and get my gear together for this ruse. But first I<br/>
would need to make up with Phyllis. I wanted her to do a little phone<br/>
work for me and try to track down information on McCaw, Geraldson, and<br/>
Davis McPhetridge.  If there was any record of these people in Olympia<br/>
Phyllis could find it through her network of contacts at the phone<br/>
company, the county clerk's office, and assessor's office, and the DMV.<br/>
<br/>
I left the apartment at 6:30 and was met in the hall by the front door<br/>
by my landlord, Mr. Grimm.  He had that look in his eye and I knew I<br/>
was cornered. "You owe me $85 Stealthboxxer and if you don't pay me<br/>
today I will kick you out on the street!"<br/>
<br/>
Talk about the direct approach. "OK, Mel, here you go. Sorry it took<br/>
me so long to get the money for you."  I reached into my pocket and<br/>
pulled out 5 coins and handed them over. "Here's $100.  That covers<br/>
last month and fifteen down on this month." <br/>
<br/>
Funny how holding gold changes people's attitude instantly. "Well,<br/>
thank you Mr. Stealthboxxer, have a nice day."  He practically skipped<br/>
down the hallway.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up my car and drove to the office. Phyllis would not be in<br/>
until 9am so I took advantage of that fact and left her a note<br/>
detailing my request to look up any info on Geraldson, McCaw, and<br/>
McPhetridge. I told her in the note that I would be back in the<br/>
afternoon to see what she might have found. I also told her about the<br/>
$40 I left for her in the desk drawer. I left her another $20 coin as<br/>
well to sweeten her up a bit too. Then I got my fake ID and business<br/>
cards for my alias and left the office again. <br/>
<br/>
I drove back across town to the maritime museum and library.  It was<br/>
still only 7:30 and the museum didnt open until 9am so I parked my car<br/>
in the lot and decided to take a walk along the waterfront since the<br/>
rain had finally let up. It was a little chilly but the wind was not<br/>
too bad and the sun was actually shining for the first time in weeks.<br/>
I descended down the wooden steps from the museum to the waterfront. I<br/>
began walking northward up the waterfront. I passed several small work<br/>
boats moored at the west side docks and stopped at a bench overlooking<br/>
the harbor.  A ship carrying logs was being made ready to depart the<br/>
port and a tug was being brought in to tow it into the deeper waters<br/>
of the bay. I watched the men on the ship haul in the tow line from<br/>
the tug and tie it off on the bow.  Soon they untied the ship from the<br/>
pier and it began to move away slowly. The port had been built by<br/>
dredging out the mud of the shallow bay and filling in adjacent areas<br/>
of the bay with all kinds of fill. Gravel, dirt, sand, rock, and<br/>
garbage was used to fill in the mud and create a narrow peninsula for<br/>
the port. Much of the fill was actually the rubble of old buildings<br/>
that had collapsed during an earthquake as well as old street cars,<br/>
train cars, and other industrial garbage.  The port of Olympia was a<br/>
veritable cemetery of South Sound business and industry, a thousand<br/>
sad stories of failed dreams buried in the mud making room for a ten<br/>
thousand more dreams to be tried out. In fact, the entire downtown<br/>
area of Olympia was built on top of former failures and disasters. The<br/>
city would be stricken over and over with catastrophy but refused to die.<br/>
<br/>
My mind drifted away with the ship as it was slowly towed to deeper<br/>
waters and then released from it's tow and sent on its way under its<br/>
own power.  I awoke from my daydream and looked at my watch. Quarter<br/>
to nine. Time to get to work.<br/>
<br/>
I walked back southward along the waterfront toward the museum. At the<br/>
base of the steps to the museum I found the old sailor that I had seen<br/>
a couple days prior feeding the gulls again. This time he spoke first,<br/>
"a might awful weather were havin."<br/>
<br/>
"Worst kind," I replied. He chuckled at that and tossed a couple of<br/>
bread scraps toward the water as the gulls dove in for their snack. I<br/>
made my way up to the top of the steps and turned and admired the<br/>
sight of the sun directly over the Capitol Dome. For all of it's ugly<br/>
and hastily buried past, Olympia can be a very beautiful city at times. <br/>
<br/>
I decided against waiting outside the museum entrance and went back to<br/>
my car. I only had to wait about five minutes before the museum<br/>
curator, a white haired man in a black pea coat and a captains cap<br/>
drove in and parked a few stalls down from me.  He got out and,<br/>
carrying a worn dark leather satchel, walked to the front of the<br/>
museum and unlocked the door.  Soon lights were on inside.  A few<br/>
minutes later, Laurel showed up too. She parked next to me and waved<br/>
when she saw it was me.  I got out of the car and met her in front of<br/>
her car.<br/>
<br/>
"Mr. Stealthboxxer, I didnt expect you until later this afternoon."<br/>
She went to the back door of her car and began piling books into a<br/>
cardboard box that had spilled all over the backseat.<br/>
<br/>
"I can come back if you havent finished transcribing the notes..."<br/>
<br/>
"No, I have everything ready for you inside. I just didnt expect you<br/>
this early."<br/>
<br/>
"Well, I decided to get an early start this morning.  Can I help you<br/>
carry your books?"<br/>
<br/>
"Certainly. I will need to check in with Mr. McDonough before I open<br/>
the library.  It will take a few minutes and you can wait in the foyer." <br/>
<br/>
"Alright."  She continued to pile books into the box.  She put in the<br/>
last one and I moved up and picked up the box.  She must do some heavy<br/>
reading over the weekend, my back was aching from the load.  We walked<br/>
across the parking lot and she opened the door for me and motioned to<br/>
a large heavy table in the foyer where I could rest the books while<br/>
she checked in. I stayed in the foyer and looked over the artifacts<br/>
displayed near the entrance. Several ship's bells, anchors, clocks,<br/>
and carved wooden figureheads that once adorned various ships that had<br/>
plied the waters of Puget Sound over the last 100 years or so. She<br/>
returned after a few minutes and we moved down the stairs to the<br/>
library entrance. Again, she motioned to another table where I could<br/>
put the box of books. After I placed the box I straightened up and my<br/>
spine popped in several places.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, Mr. Stealthboxxer." She walked behind the counter to the desk<br/>
and retrieved a thin notebook and then returned to where I was<br/>
standing next to the table. "I have all the notes you asked for<br/>
transcribed in this notebook as well as some other information I was<br/>
able to find about some of the other frequent shippers using the<br/>
Escalate over the years. Is there anything else you need?" She stood<br/>
smiling very attractively in front of me. I hadnt noticed it when she<br/>
first arrived but the mild mannered librarian was looking quite<br/>
different than she had two days before. The brown dress was replaced<br/>
with a white and red floral pattern, the dark brown knit sweater was<br/>
now a pink shawl and the typical bun hairdoo was replaced with curls<br/>
and ribbons.  She was also wearing lipstick and pearl earings and her<br/>
glasses were nowhere to be found.  She was obviously dressing up for<br/>
someone. When I smiled back at her I knew it was me.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you, ma'am. You have done much more than I had asked. I am not<br/>
sure if I will need any further assistance at this point but I may<br/>
return in the future."<br/>
<br/>
"I certainly hope that you do, Mr. Stealthboxxer."<br/>
<br/>
"Please, call me SB."<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, SB. And you can call me anytime you like." She walked up<br/>
next to the table and wrote down something on a slip of paper and<br/>
handed it to me. She smiled and then walked to her desk, hips moving<br/>
rythmically. I stood there looking at the piece of paper, her name and<br/>
phone number. I glanced back at her as she sat at her desk still<br/>
smiling at me. I tipped my hat, smiled back at her, and turned and<br/>
walked up the stairs and back to my car. I stowed the phone number in<br/>
my wallet and made a mental note to call on her the next time I needed<br/>
a date.<br/>
<br/>
I drove back to town and stopped at the bank to change some coins.  Of<br/>
the $900 that the lady had given me on Friday I had spent about $250.<br/>
I still had 32 coins left.  I changed out $300 worth into bills and<br/>
put the rest of the coins in my safe deposit box for a rainy day which<br/>
happens more frequently than not in Olympia, Washington.<br/>
<br/>
After the bank I turned west again on State Avenue and headed up and<br/>
over the hill and toward Mud Bay.  The address of the Geraldson<br/>
Corporation which was also the former office of the McCay Logging<br/>
Company was on Mud Bay Rd right where it crossed Eld Inlet at Mud Bay.<br/>
The terminus of the logging railroad was here and it was here where<br/>
logs cut in the black hills around Bordeaux had been dumped into the<br/>
bay and rafted together and towed to the mills further north on Puget<br/>
Sound.<br/>
<br/>
I drove down the steep grade toward the bay and turned on the driveway<br/>
leading toward the water that marked with the sign to Geraldson<br/>
Corporation.  I pulled down the drive which was lined with maple and<br/>
alder trees, trees that grow quickly and take the place of firs and<br/>
cedars once they are cut down.  I rounded the last bend in the drive<br/>
to find that there was no building at the end of the drive, only a<br/>
recently exposed foundation and a few piles of wood scrap rubble. <br/>
Apparently the Geraldson Corporation had just moved out and demolished<br/>
the building as well as several smaller outbuildings on the premises.<br/>
 I parked my car and decided to poke around a little.<br/>
<br/>
I stepped out of the car and the smell of sulphur hit me like a sudden<br/>
dip in a sewage cespool.  The tide must be out.  Mud Bay, really the<br/>
southern end of Eld Inlet, is a very shallow intertidal area where<br/>
McLane Creek empties into Puget Sound. The tide levels fluctuate as<br/>
much as 12 feet at times and most of the time the area is exposed<br/>
black mud composed of rotting organic sediment and ocean creatures.<br/>
Twice daily the mud flats are washed with salt water to further<br/>
amplify the smell. Several oyster farms are located further up the bay<br/>
where the famous Olympia oysters are raised commercially by diking the<br/>
shallow gravelly areas to keep in the sea water. These Olympia oysters<br/>
were known as the Succulent Lobbyist as they were regularly served to<br/>
politicos in the early days of Olympia's history as the State Capitol.<br/>
<br/>
I walked around the area and found nothing.  There were a few pieces<br/>
of rusted railroad machinery behind one of the former outbuildings but<br/>
nothing that could give me any clues to the dissapearance of a<br/>
nameless man. There was a walkway that led away from the office toward<br/>
the bay.  I followed it down to the waterfront.  There was nothing<br/>
left there but rotting pilings where the old rail pier used to stand.<br/>
 Another industrial corpse to add to the pile of failed dreams that<br/>
line the banks of South Puget Sound.  It was depressing me.  The site<br/>
of the rotting pilings, the smell of the rotting stench in the bay,<br/>
the abandoned and demolished buildings.  There was nothing here.<br/>
<br/>
I walked back toward my car. Maybe Phyllis would turn up something. As<br/>
I turned the corner of the pathway back toward the former office and<br/>
to where my car was parked I noticed someone standing next to my car<br/>
peering in the windows. I approached quietly but a crow in a maple<br/>
tree cawed as it flew away toward the bay and he looked up and saw me<br/>
walking toward him. "Hello! You must be looking for the Geraldson<br/>
Corporation. Afraid you're a little late. They cleared out of here<br/>
about the end of September. Demolition crew just finished up last<br/>
week." He was a man in his mid thirties dressed in jeans, work shirt,<br/>
and boots. He had a friendly face and didn't seem wary of me at all.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, apparently I am too late. Do you know if they moved to a<br/>
different office in town? "<br/>
<br/>
"Nope.  They closed up shop for good.  Moved everyone back to their<br/>
headquarters in Colorado I hear. You a salesperson or something?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah." I decided to go into my alias. No sense in giving this person<br/>
who I really didnt know any information about myself or the case. "I'm<br/>
Arthur Fredrickson, Regional Sales Rep for Henderson Associates."  I<br/>
handed him a fake business card with the name of Arthur Fredrickson<br/>
and Henderson Associates with a non existent address and phone number.<br/>
 This was usually nondescript enough to get me into most business<br/>
offices without too many questions.  The card didnt say what the<br/>
Henderson Associates were involved in or what Arthur Fredrickson was<br/>
selling but it usually gave folks enough false security to get me in<br/>
the door to ask questions without raising suspicion too quickly.  It<br/>
was especially useful in insurance investigations since most cases<br/>
involved suspected fraud on the part of business owners.  Businesses<br/>
are very used to having salespeople call on them unannounced and<br/>
giving a receptionist or secretery a printed business card of a fake<br/>
salesperson is much better than the direct approach. <br/>
<br/>
"Well, Arthur Fredrickson, I'm Davis McPhetridge. I live just down the<br/>
way.  I was out mending a fence post out by the road that one of my<br/>
cows knocked down and saw you drive in.  I figured I would come over<br/>
and let you know that Geraldson had moved out.  Looks like you found<br/>
that out yourself."<br/>
<br/>
"Davis McPhetridge you say?  Are you related to the Davis McPhetridge<br/>
that worked as a railroad fireman for the McCaw Logging Company?"<br/>
<br/>
He looked at me with a very surprised look and his tone changed to<br/>
hesitancy when he replied, "Yes, he was my father. But McCaw closed up<br/>
operations back in '27 and Dad retired back around '03. How did you<br/>
know about my father working for McCaw?" <br/>
<br/>
"Mr. McPhetridge, I must apologize for misleading you. I'm not really<br/>
a salesman for Henderson Associates. And my name is not really Arthur<br/>
Fredrickson.  My name is Enigma Stealthboxxer and I am a private<br/>
investigator."<br/>
<br/>
"Well, Mr. Stealthboxxer, that still doesn't tell me how you know<br/>
about my father."<br/>
<br/>
"It's a long story but I have recently come to find out that your<br/>
father was a friend and co-worker of my grandfather before your father<br/>
went to work for McCaw.  I am investigating a case that involves both<br/>
the Geraldson Corporation and the McCaw Logging Company.  If you don't<br/>
mind I would like to ask you some questions about them."<br/>
<br/>
"Wow. Dad always said it would happen some day. I figured that after<br/>
he died it wouldn't really matter anymore."<br/>
<br/>
"What do you mean?"<br/>
<br/>
"My father told me that someday someone would come around asking for<br/>
information on the McCaw operations. He said that there were things<br/>
that had happened there that had been hidden from the public but that<br/>
some day they would be made known and when they did someone would come<br/>
asking him about them."<br/>
<br/>
"Are you saying that your father had information about some wrong<br/>
doings involving McCaw?"<br/>
<br/>
"Not Mr. McCaw. Dad always said that Sam McCaw was a good man. No sir,<br/>
Mr. Stealthboxxer, what he was referring to was the McCaw Company and<br/>
its real owner, Geraldson.  I think you had better come to my house<br/>
and see somthing that Dad left for an occasion like this."<br/>
<br/>
I had McPhetridge get in the passenger seat and we drove my car to his<br/>
farm house which was adjacent to the old McCaw/Geraldson property.<br/>
Maybe there was something worth coming out here for after all.<br/>
