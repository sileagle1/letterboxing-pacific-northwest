                    <div class="plaintext-content">Took a little trip out to McLane Creek yesterday, April 16.  Had been <br>
there once before.  This time I went alone.  Saw only 2 other people <br>
in the park from 5:30-8pm.  Found the 3 new letterboxes and took some <br>
time to be alone in the woods.  The sound of the creek flowing nearby <br>
put my soul at ease.  I found a really nice little spot next to the <br>
creek under some large trees that was actually dry and comfortable <br>
and just took the time to be quiet and listen to God's creation.  <br>
Peace like a river...It is well with my soul.  Had enough time to <br>
create a little bonus box of my own while I sat there. Anyone wanting <br>
to find my new box will have to visit the other boxes at the park to <br>
find the clues.  <br>
<br>
I hope that all who follow me there will find as much peace as I did <br>
for my stressed mind.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to hear you are troubled.  I was going to stop by Sunday on my <br>
way home from longview , chahalis etc but the rain was really bad at <br>
that time.<br>
<br>
I agree with you however about the flowing water.  I love the <br>
letterboxes that have flowing water associated with them.  I think <br>
you hit it on the head with how pacifying it is.<br>
<br>
You will love the Cougar Mountain boxes.  Have you and the family <br>
tackled yet.  You can get a serious 5 - 8 mile round trip hike if you <br>
plan carefully.<br>
<br>
I will plan to make a return trip for the new T & E / Evil Glenn <br>
boxes.  Good to know someone has survived hunting for them. :-)<br>
