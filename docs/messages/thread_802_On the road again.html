retype the info all over again.  The Fright Fest is being hosted by<br>
Rayvenhaus and, like others on this list, Rayvenhaus's items are posted to a<br>
different website. Far be it from me to try and consolidate the myriad of<br>
websites that exist for letterboxing in the Pacific Northwest into one<br>
community.<br>
<br>
My intentions are to provide an alternative place for the PNW community to<br>
gather and share at. If you don't have the time to 'monitor' yet another<br>
page, then by all means, don't.  I can't, nor will I attempt to force anyone<br>
to monitor or join another site.<br>

Have a wonderful day!<br>

P.S.  The directions and other pertinent information concerning Fright Fest<br>
are at www.myndworx.com. Since I've already been blasted twice for<br>
duplicating information, I'll not duplicate it again.<br>
