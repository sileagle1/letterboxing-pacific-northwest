                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went up Mt. Tabor a couple of weeks ago in search of Der Mad Stamper's<br>
classic letterbox, but unfortunately the stamp was MISSING!  I was unable to<br>
contact DMS even with multiple email addresses, but after careful<br>
consideration and good advice from Ryan and Funhog, we decided that it would<br>
be best to make a reproduction of the original stamp.  The log book was<br>
almost full, so that has also been replaced.  (If anyone knows how I can get<br>
in touch with Der Mad Stamper, please let me know--I would like to send the<br>
log book to him.)<br>
 <br>
The Mt. Tabor box gets a lot of visitors, so I am very happy to report that<br>
it is again alive and well!  And would you believe that this letterbox just<br>
turned five years old on July 8?  Even if you've been there before, maybe<br>
the new stamp and five-year anniversary are good excuses to go visit an old<br>
letterbox again.  It's one of my favorite hiding spots and stamp designs so<br>
far (Thanks, Mad Stamper!) so I hope you take the time to stop by and enjoy<br>
it!<br>
