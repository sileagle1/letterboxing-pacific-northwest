We are our own worst critiques.  It is incredible how evident progress is<br>
when one looks at their old stamps.  I have some stamps I want to place<br>
before I lose my nerve - I carved them months ago and they're nothing<br>
special but they have meaning.  Anyway, every box is a treasure and unique<br>
in it's own way.  I enjoy them all.<br>
<br>
To all -<br>
I so regret not being able to make it to March Madness.  It sounded like a<br>
good time.  Look forward to seeing you all at Silver Falls . . .  and maybe<br>
the Spokane outing, too.  Or maybe on the trail!!<br>
<br>
So . . . who arranged this weather?  Great, huh!!??<br>
Warm wishes,<br>

<br>
  So yesterday I set out to collect several of my LB's close to home<br>
  for some maintanence, They will be re-hidden today in very nice<br>
  looking camoflauged rubber-maid containers, I dont know why I didnt<br>
  think of the camo sooner considering how often I find LBs hiding<br>
  spots and its like "Oh gee there it is, out in the open, bright blue<br>
  lid, Im suprised no one has taken it yet" because I am sure in the<br>
  wind and rain and such our leaves and bark and debris we put on top<br>
  of the boxes gets removed,  but anyways, that wasnt my point haha I<br>
  grabbed my "endangered wildlife" LB, which was the first I ever<br>
  planted, and now that I look at it after 2 years of letterboxing,<br>
  gee.. I am kind of embarassed to put it back out there in the wild.<br>
  Its just sooo..uumm...beginner level crappy stamp haha and the log<br>
  book is atrocious. I guess as I have learned to carve better and do<br>
  better logbooks, this letterbox just looks ridiculously kindergarten<br>
  style to me now haha :o) but dont let that stop all you treasure<br>
  seekers out there from locating it :o) just dont think "Erfellie must<br>
  be really lame" when you find it haha :o)<br>
