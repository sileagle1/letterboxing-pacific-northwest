The fire pit was understandably destroyed but they scattered the ashes over the whole area, which made for a very dirty campsite.  What a shame that such a beautiful and peaceful place has become an eyesore.  We hope to get back there soon to clean up the trash, but alas, when we got back to our car, it had been vandalized, window smashed and items stolen.  Puts a real damper on faith in humanity.  <br/>

Wallowas. Since my partner and I have been together for nearly a<br/>
million  years, unlike the newly hitched Mudstumpers, I DID manage to<br/>
find time to hide a letterbox in the area. The stamp image was drawn<br/>
in an alpine meadow filled with wildflowers as I stood face to face<br/>
with my favorite llama. The carving was done that evening at the<br/>
campfire. The clue will follow soon.<br/>
<br/>
On the return journey, we stopped at Deadman Pass and stamped into<br/>
Heather's box. The carving is way cute. Being subtle in that rest area<br/>
is far from easy, especially when the park guy is watering the lawn,<br/>
trucks are coming and going and a Winnebago pulls in every thirty seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Before we left on our trek, we spent a couple nights in Central OR. I<br/>
excitedly hit the trail looking for the boxes hidden along the Redmond<br/>
Dry Canyon Trail by the mysterious new boxer, "Birder." Box 1 was an<br/>
easy find but the second eluded me. The "dead wood prevails' but I<br/>
didn't. All I managed to find was some really rank porn hidden in a<br/>
crevice and a bunch of trash. Instead of leaving with a new stamp in<br/>
my book I left with a lovely collection of garbage to deposit at the<br/>
nearest trash can. Funhog<br/>
