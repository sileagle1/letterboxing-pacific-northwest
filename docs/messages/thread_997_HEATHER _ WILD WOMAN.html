wonderful Heather and Wild Woman were at the Roadhouse Gathering.   They<br>
are terrific talented people and have excellent children, too.  Wild<br>
Child, Button, Shark and Lil Bug did not attend, but their cool moms<br>
sure did...AND I NEGLECTED TO MENTION THEM IN MY LAST POST.  I certainly<br>
didn't forget you...I just thought I had acknowledged you in the note<br>
already.  BAD GIRL, BAD GIRL, BAD GIRL.  You two are terrific and I had<br>
to let you know publicly and apologize for my gross oversight.  Thanks<br>
for a great time.  Let's load up the kids and head out sometime.  <br>

Best regards,<br>

me.   Anyway, I read your HEATHER AND WILD WOMAN message before I read your <br>
LONG: ROADHOUSE one, so I missed my opportunity to get my nose out of joint...<br>

P.S. And praising our children--who (as you pointed out) were not even <br>
PRESENT--is always a smart, endearing move!  <br>
