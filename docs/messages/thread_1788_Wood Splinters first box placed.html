More fruit from the Battle Ground Stamp camp.  Wood Splinters placed his<br/>
first box!  It's located in the region of his youth, southeastern WA ....<br/>
where few boxes reside.  It's called Horse Heaven Hills and is between<br/>
Umatilla and Kennewick.  The stamp is quite good.  If you're out that way<br/>
it's just a short swing off the freeway!  <br/>

Congratulations - it is really outstanding that Woodsplinters have planted<br/>
his first letterbox. When we are up that way - we will be sure to put this<br/>
one on our list to hunt for.  If I recall correctly we have already found<br/>
your first one SloMo - and if it is any clue to the quality of letterbox -<br/>
then we are all in for a real treat. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you - and take care. <br/>

you clever people, right?  We're happy there's enthusiasm for a box way over<br/>

Oh, Wood Splinters carves much better than I . . . well let's just say I<br/>
think you'll like it.  Can't wait for him to place a box around here!<br/>

Hope more boxes show up over that way.  But I have to admit, it takes a<br/>
desert rat like Wood Splinters to come up with locations. I'm not sure what<br/>
to do when there's no trees, branches, stumps, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Funhog, we see your stamp in many boxes that we've been to and have been to<br/>
your Wake Robin box.  Hope to meet you some day!<br/>

&gt;Cool!  Cool!  Cool!  That's really good news!  I get so envious reading<br/>
about all the awesome<br/>
&gt;boxes on the west side...seems like there are new additions every week,<br/>
nice to have something &gt;new on the east side of the mountains.  We'll look<br/>

&gt;Cities.  BTW, did you have time to look for Sacajawea?<br/>
&gt;Colls (from Spokane)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and I was so disappointed at the lack of boxes in the tri-cities.  We<br/>
tried to find Sacajawea in July and it would have been our second Lb find.<br/>
But they put rock steps in the area and we couldn't find it.  We have a<br/>
rather funny photo with four butts (my in-laws) all searching through the<br/>
rubble for the box.   We didn't attempt it this trip because the park is<br/>
closed for the winter.  *sigh*   And boy is it COLD over there!!!  Anyway .<br/>
. .<br/>
<br/>
THIS BOX IS FOR YOU, COLLS!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
