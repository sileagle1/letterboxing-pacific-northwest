These two letterboxes are definite drivebys. Restroom facilities are <br>
not available at either location. One of the locations has a site-<br>
specific stamp, while the other stamp is a carving of a subject Don <br>
wanted to carve, but we haven't really found a good spot for it in <br>
over a year. You can be the judge if the stamp fits or not.<br>
