Come join Cat's Meow and I for lunch and a Christmas Ornament <br/>
Exchange Gathering in Vancouver,WA., Saturday, December 11 at 1:00 <br/>
pm. The location has yet to be determined and I will let you know <br/>
where as soon as I make a reservation. I was so inspired by a recent <br/>
PLB that I received and thought it would be a great way to get some <br/>
of the many letterboxers in the Vancouver and surrounding areas <br/>
together to finally meet each other. In order to participate in the <br/>
ornament exchange at 2:00 pm, you must bring an ornament, hand made, <br/>
with the theme of letterboxing, and wrapped in holiday wrapping <br/>
paper. We will have lunch, exchange signature and gathering stamps, <br/>
play some fun games and everyone can then go find some of the <br/>
wonderful letterboxes that are planted all over the Vancouver area. <br/>
Please R.S.V.P., A.S.A.P. to tinarie at msn dot com if you would like <br/>
to come so that I can make the reservation. If you cannot make it at <br/>
1:00 for lunch then please join us at 2:00 for the exchange. See you <br/>
there!<br/>
