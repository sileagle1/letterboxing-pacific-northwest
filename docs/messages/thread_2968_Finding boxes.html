                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well we went around the peninsula today and found 17 stamps (although several in the same box).  For example the one at Lake Quinault Lodge had 3 stamps in it; but could only record one.  I also found the Trillium and Sitka Spruce near Lake Quinault; but I cannot find them on here to log them.  I'm not sure why I can't find them.  Any suggestions?<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
