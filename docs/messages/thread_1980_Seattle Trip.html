                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a question. During Spring Break (April 4-8 for us) we are going to be<br/>
taking the train up to Seattle and then will be staying at the Seattle Inn<br/>
(close to the Space Needle). We will not have a car and will mostly be<br/>
hoofing it or taking public transit in the Downtown area. We will have our<br/>
two boys, ages 6 and 9 with us. What boxes in the downtown area would you<br/>
all recommend to us?<br/>

Mid-Seattle letterboxes?<br/>
<br/>
There are only 2/possibly 3 relatively near to where you're staying <br/>
(by relative I mean a couple of miles).  There's a new one near the <br/>
needle itself (I haven't yet visited it--I think it's Zen Fruit II <br/>
or something?) and then one near the REI flagship store and possibly <br/>
one still near Pioneer Square (although somebody said it's probably <br/>
missing).  Otherwise, most of the letterboxes are in locations <br/>
further out and about the greater metro area.  If you head to <br/>
Woodland Park Zoo, you'll be close to a few more.  If you venture <br/>
over to West Seattle, you'll be near a bunch more. These locales, <br/>
though, require some sort of transportation, though--unless the kids <br/>
are up for some marathons.  ;)  If you head to the Ballard Locks, <br/>
you'll be near another one or two (not sure how they're doing these <br/>
days).  One's definitely there--not sure about the other.  <br/>
<br/>
Some ideas--however, if I had a hotel near the Space Needle, I'd <br/>
probably just linger in the area and enjoy the sights around there--<br/>
since you'll be paying for the 'experience'.  Must 'non-<br/>
letterboxing' dos with kids in Seattle--Pacific Science Center, Pike <br/>
Place Market, Odyssey Maritime Discovery Museum on the Waterfront <br/>
(Pier 66) http://www.ody.org/   If you can head over to West Seattle <br/>
during low tide--check out the tide pools at Mee Kwa Mooks (there <br/>
are a couple of nearby letterboxes, too). Alki Beach is a great <br/>
spot, too!<br/>
<br/>
Have a fun trip!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the info. We have been to Seattle quite a few times and always<br/>
stay at this hotel so we have hit lots of the main tourist stuff. Some of my<br/>
favorite things are "the Seattle Underground Tour" and "Ride the Duck" tour.<br/>
Anyway, that is why I was hoping there might be some boxes in the area<br/>
(something different to do), but oh well. We'll see about checking the ones<br/>
you mentioned. The boys do want to go up in the Space Needle cause we<br/>
haven't done that in a while. I didn't know about the tide pools. That might<br/>
be fun to check out.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment our trip is looking slightly iffy, just got news that my FIL<br/>
is in serious condition. May be heading to Arizona instead.<br/>

pouring rain!  Had a great time watching the locks but were unable to find <br/>
the "Ballard Locks" letterbox.  Said a new log book was placed on 2/8/05 but <br/>
had no luck.<br/>
<br/>
We also visited the Zen Fruit II at the Space Needle and it was a good one - <br/>
go prepared though.  We hadn't looked up quite enough beforehand and asked <br/>
for help on the whereabouts of one item and no one had any clue there (the <br/>
employees and tour guides).  Didn't let on to them what we were really <br/>
looking for but we ended up finding it on our own.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, our girls are 6 and 8 so we are about the same kid-wise.  They had a <br/>
blast.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
