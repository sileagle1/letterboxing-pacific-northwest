that She Who Plants isn't the type to be upset if someone that wasn't on the<br>

much decided that from now on I would only pass a box to my friends if they<br>
were on the list as well, just sort of bump them up since it was in my<br>
possession, I just don't like getting yelled at hehehe and I suppose it does<br>
make sense that if you open a Postal Letterbox and a list for people to get<br>
on, and they don't get on it, then it's not kosher per say to give it to<br>
them.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
What do you all think about this one? Is it a no no to give a Postal<br>
Letterbox to a friend that wasn't on the list for it?<br>

up a topic for discussion. I know if I post something on a board I pretty<br>

did not say you did anything wrong, nor did I say you did anything I did not<br>
do. In fact, I said that I did the same thing and got yelled at for it and<br>
that it taught me a lesson. I did not say I agreed with that lesson, nor did<br>
I say that you should not have stamped into the box, nor did I demand some<br>
sort of explanation.  - In fact to reiterate what I said again, I said<br>
hello, and that I was glad you got the box and that it was cool - I merely<br>
took the subject from there and opened it up for some discussion. Since I<br>
got yelled at for doing the same thing several weeks ago I thought I would<br>
see what the general school of thought was.  <br>

I'm sorry you felt the need to become so defensive and felt slighted.<br>
However I promise you Willow there was no intention of doing such in my<br>
post.  I am not sure what "wrath" you think floats on this board, but I<br>
haven't seen it, were I to see it; I would leave this list just as I left<br>
the main list.  But you certainly got no wrath from me, just on topic<br>
conversation.  Trust me, my wrath is much worse than an email saying "I did<br>
the same thing and got yelled at, what do you think about this guys?"<br>

<br>
Hmm.....  This is essentially a two-part question as I see it, since <br>
it has the *potential* to upset two parties: (1) The creator of the <br>
postal box if they didn't want the box used in this manner and (2) <br>
the person receiving the box in the mail may not want to deal with <br>
it!  Not everyone is a big fan of postal boxes.<br>
<br>
Anyhow....  As for passing it on to people not on the official <br>
mailing list--I don't see any harm in that as long as the person who <br>
created the box doesn't mind.  If they don't want it happening, they <br>
ought to write so directly in the logbook for the box.  Presumeably, <br>
if they haven't written such a comment, I'd assume they'd be okay <br>
with others stamping in as long as it didn't delay the box's travel <br>
too much.<br>
<br>
If you're mailing it off to a friend not on the list, though, I'd <br>
double check first that they were actually interested in the box.  <br>
I'm not really interested in postal boxes myself, so I'd be rather <br>
put out if I got one unexpectedly in the mail!<br>
<br>
But as long as *everyone* involved doesn't mind, go for it.  =)<br>

PLBs and Virtuals  like the HH, are a different species.  Maybe they should have their own talk lists ????  Which would keep them seperate and then only those who join the group would be on the mailing lists and the creators can plan ahead to determine the number of pages to include.  <br>

<br>
Postal boxes already has its own talk list: <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/postal_letterboxing/ <br>
<br>
Virtual boxes don't have a talk list so far as I know, but I rarely <br>
see anyone actually try to figure them out or discuss them very <br>
often.  If it became more pervasive, I'd create a new talk list, but <br>
it's not worth the effort at this point.  (In my opinion.)<br>
