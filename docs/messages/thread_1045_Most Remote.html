Does anyone know what the most remote LB might be?  The LB located furthest <br/>
away from any others?<br/>
<br/>
I've been working on a LB to leave when I go visit my brother.  He truly <br/>
lives in the middle of no where.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering!<br/>

I *hate* when that happens!  It ruins an otherwise perfectly good <br/>
day!<br/>
<br/>
The longest hike I've ever had to do to nab a letterbox--not <br/>
including the AT since there are trailheads I could have used MUCH <br/>
closer to the letterbox than the one I used in Georgia--was Don and <br/>
Gwen's Paradise Lodge letterboxes in Southern Oregon.  I hiked just <br/>
shy of 25 miles to get those boxes--and that was from the closest <br/>
trailhead I could find to the boxes!  Which makes them pretty darned <br/>
remote if you ask me.  =)<br/>
<br/>
The boxes in places like Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and such are the <br/>
most remote I've found population-wise.  You can drive for hours at <br/>
a time and not see anyone else on the road.<br/>
<br/>
But the letterbox farthest from other letterboxes?  The two I hid in <br/>
Zimbabwe, Africa, might have that award.  There *might* be another <br/>
letterbox within a thousand miles of there, but not likely.<br/>
<br/>
But if you don't want to get international, I'd imagine Hawaii or <br/>
Alaska would probably get some "most remost" letterbox awards.<br/>
