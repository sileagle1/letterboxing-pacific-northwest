<br/>
I'll be visiting Portland next month and wanted to invite you all to <br/>
participate in the opportunity for some boxing-galore!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Bindle Bum isn't making the trip with me, so I'm on my own this <br/>
time.  This is my first visit to Portland, so I'm not familiar with <br/>
the city. I'll be staying at the Embassy Suites/Airport and won't be <br/>
getting a rental car. However, not to worry  I understand Portland <br/>
has a wonderful public transportation system and the very dear, <br/>
Maiden1974 (Melanie) has offered to play host and driver for some <br/>
boxing!<br/>
<br/>
This is what has been planned have so far: <br/>
<br/>
Wed 2/18   Everyone welcome to join meeting up with Funhog and <br/>
myself at the Laurelwood Pub for dinner and stamp exchanges .... <br/>
time undecided as yet (Do we need reservations for this place, <br/>
Funhog?)<br/>
<br/>
Friday 2/20   Maiden will pick me up from my hotel at 2:15p and <br/>
we're going out boxing! Everyone is invited to join us, Maiden will <br/>
be in charge of choosing the area to be searched.  Then it's on to <br/>
the Spaghetti Factory in Vancouver for dinner around 6pm (Thank you <br/>
Willow for being willing to make the reservations!)  Please contact <br/>
Willow with your RSVP so she'll know how many are planning to attend.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday 2/12   I am free the entire day and Maiden has once again <br/>
generously offered to host me for another half day of boxing! Of <br/>
course, everyone is welcome to join us.  We'll be out from about <br/>
10am until maybe 3pm with Maiden once again selecting the area for <br/>
searching.  After that, I'm open to more boxing,  another dinner-<br/>
time stamp exchange gathering, or whatever!<br/>
<br/>
I had a hitch hiker in my Kent Trails box last time I checked.  If <br/>
it's still there after Valentines Day I'll go unbury him from under <br/>
a couple feet of snow and bring him along with me.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting a bunch of you and putting some face to <br/>
the names I see on this lists.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Then maybe we can find the two boxes that SleepyWhippet is hiding for <br/>
us down there.. Umm...dumb us forgot to stamp the images into our <br/>
logbooks before handing them into her capable box hiding hands!! But <br/>
then I suppose they would count as a find too since we have no idea <br/>
where she will be planting them for us!! LOL!! <br/>
