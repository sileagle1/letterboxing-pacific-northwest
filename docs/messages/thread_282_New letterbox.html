to Austin sometime and want to look for this box, don't decode the <br/>
spoiler. <br/>

  Hi :o) Well I finally got my letterbox placed, I carved the stamp <br/>
last year, but just never found a good enough place to put it! And I <br/>
am most proud of this stamp, its definitly worth the travel and <br/>
deciphering I think, but then again I am biased I guess cuz its mine <br/>
haha. It can be found on LBNA under "Disney Trivia" in Coos County, <br/>
Oregon, Region #6 (Southwestern Oregon). There just arent enough <br/>
letterboxes in this county! this would make it the 7th LB out there, <br/>
but there a great stamps :o) Coquille River, September Seagull, and <br/>
Sandy Creek Covered bridge are some of my favorites. Well since I <br/>
must be the only one travels to this town on a regular basis I guess <br/>
its up to me to plant more there :o) and maybe, just maybe, someone <br/>
that lives there might find out what it letterboxing is, we could use <br/>
one more letterboxer, right? So this letterbox might take you a <br/>
little work to find it, you must decipher the (easy) clues and the <br/>
only way to do this is to watch a certain Disney movie with your <br/>
family (and dont forget the popcorn) because this box was made <br/>
especially for this reason, to bring families together for a night of <br/>
family fun, so enjoy it :o)<br/>

It wasn't TOO remote, we actually found it during a brief interlude <br/>
from our Oregon Coast camping trip, Oct 03.  The coolest thing <br/>
happened on the way to find this beautiful remnant of the past--it <br/>
was foggy in/around the mountains along the drive and we saw half a <br/>
dozen glorious white mountain goats literally climbing straight up a <br/>
cliff high above the highway!  It was awesome &amp; something we'll <br/>
never forget.  Had you not planted that cool letterbox there in that <br/>
area we would have never experienced that cool sight!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
