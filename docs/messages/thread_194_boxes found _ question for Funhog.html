and ran off with Heather &amp; her 2-year-old to enjoy a stroll thru Crystal <br/>
Springs &amp; a nabbing of the letterbox therein.  (Lots of blooms!  Lots of <br/>
ducks &amp; geese!  One raccoon!)<br/>
<br/>
We also hit Paisley Orca's Bike Route LB and Sol Stamper's Nature Book 1.  <br/>
Yahoo!<br/>
<br/>
I checked my Wallace Books letterbook--it had been replaced on the wrong <br/>
shelf but is now back where it belongs.<br/>
<br/>
Hey Funhog!  Is the Doyle Owl still in place?  We noticed you hadn't <br/>
transferred the clues to the new site, and decided with our limited time <br/>
today that we wouldn't try for a box that might not be there.  Should we look <br/>
for it or not?<br/>

Ain't the sunshine grand????<br/>
