Starvation Ridge, near Cascade Locks, Hood River County, Oregon. <br>
<br>
While we went on summer vacation, packing with llamas in the Wallowa<br>
Mountains, Windairen took on housesitting duties. Returning home, we<br>
learned that a letterbox had been hidden inside our house with one<br>
cryptic clue left as to its whereabouts. How cool is that?! After much<br>
head scratching and a few false starts, the Trekkin' Llama revealed<br>
itself.  Figuring that any llama would be much happier on a mountain<br>
ridge than in the city, I gave it a new home in the Columbia River<br>
Gorge. The book and stamp are Windairen's creation, the clue mine.<br>
This hike is steep in places with lots of ups and downs. Good shoes<br>
will help a lot with the loose dirt and gravel.<br>
<br>
To the trailhead: Take I-84 about ten miles east of Cascade Locks to<br>
exit 55, Starvation Creek Trailhead. Park here and walk back towards<br>
the Wrong Way/Do Not Enter signs for the off ramp. The trail heads<br>
west along the freeway.<br>
<br>
To the letterbox: In about a quarter mile you will reach a trail<br>
junction. Go left, up, up, up. Go left again at the next junction.<br>
When you find yourself surrounded by limbs of steel look left for a<br>
short, fragile stump. This letterbox lives in its center. (If you go<br>
up a couple more switchbacks you'll have a great view of the gorge in<br>
both directions. You've come this far already. Why not a little more?)<br>
