Can't tell you how much I enjoy having new carvers on the scene!<br/>

What's in a name? Everything...including my cachet...<br/>
<br/>
At the mill bells did ring,<br/>
A box was left, waters sing.<br/>
The spot is good with sunny skies,<br/>
but when it rains the creek will rise.<br/>
Letterboxes float away,<br/>
Mud and mold come to stay.<br/>
The hitcher left with me today,<br/>
Where it goes I cannot say.<br/>

No water was near, that would be abhorrent.<br/>
We checked again in spring and all was well.<br/>
But we know that with weather you never can tell.<br/>
Frequent visits will keep us informed.<br/>
If we must, we will, revise just a bit.<br/>
But for now we'll just let it sit. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Funhog, we are pleased you made time for our 1st boxes!  Such an honor! <br/>
