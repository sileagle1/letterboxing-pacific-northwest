FINALLY.... A GOOD use for Tupperware!<br>
The stuff has been too impractical for me.  Doesn't work well in microwave<br>
(plastic in food) or dishwasher (melts and holds water no matter how you<br>
situate it). It's usually hard to open.  <br>
Under a log... now THERE it excels!  Critters probably have a hard time<br>
getting in to it too!<br>
<br>
Sorry if there's any T salesman out there... it's only my 2 cents worth.<br>
<br>
Bye!!!<br>
