                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been told by a fellow letterboxer that the east side of Priest Point Park is undergoing "revegetation."  I'm not sure what all this entails, but the group that went letterboxing this weekend has explained that only two series on that side are available at the moment.  Mostly at risk are by ginormous Kirby series, but also some of the Centennial series and part of the Nail family's.  Perhaps some of the Flowers are in the "revegetation" area, but I don't know.  Unfortunately, I can't find specific details online.<br/>
<br/>
  Just thought I'd give people a heads up, in case your boxes are in the area and/or if you'd planned to go find some there.<br/>
<br/>
  Happy 'boxing!<br/>

If you're planting in an ivy-infested area, perhaps take the time to <br/>

any letterboxes there) to Tumwater Falls near Olympia, to Seward Park <br/>
near Seattle, Discovery Park, ALL of Mercer Island is scheduled for ivy <br/>

debate over whether volunteers would do it or if they'd just hire <br/>

in the back of your mind when you're planting new boxes in the region...<br/>

Don't suppose that'll do much for long with such a hearty thing as English Ivy, but it does increase the liklihood of hideyholes being poked in more than average.<br/>
