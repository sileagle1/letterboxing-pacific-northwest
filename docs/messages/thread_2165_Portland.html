I will be in Portland the weekend of the 12th thru the the 15th and <br/>
was wondering if there are any cheap, but not trashy hotels around. <br/>
Maybe in the greshem or beavorton area. And of course wanted to know <br/>
if anyone wanted to get together and exchange. My friend and I are <br/>
taking a huge letterboxing weekend. Was also wondering about what are <br/>
some of the must have boxes there? Any help is appreciated.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What is your definition of cheap - a price range would be helpful.  In <br/>
the Gresham area several chain hotels that are clean and reasonably <br/>
priced come to mind that cater to airport travelers - they are located <br/>
on 181st near the entrance to I-84 also near Airport Way.  Some people <br/>
call this the Troutdale area, although 181st is really just the edge of <br/>
Portland/Gresham dividing line.  If you stay there you will have plenty <br/>
of boxes available to keep you busy in the Troutdale, Gresham, Powell <br/>
Butte, and Columbia Gorge areas, just to name a few, and I would <br/>
personally drive to your hotel to meet up with you for an exchange - I'm <br/>
fairly new to letterboxing and would love to join you for a few hours of <br/>
boxing just to meet some new people, or just meet up with you to say <br/>
hello and exchange.  Where are you coming from, and how are you <br/>
traveling?  I live near that area and will give you specific names of <br/>
hotels that I know to be clean and comfortable if you give me a price <br/>
you want to stay under, and if you like the idea of that particular <br/>
area.  If you don't want one with a pool it will save you money.<br/>
<br/>
E-mail me back privately if you don't want to keep posting to the board.<br/>
