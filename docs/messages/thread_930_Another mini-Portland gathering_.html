Just wanted to let you know that I loved your stamps in the<br/>
Columbia River Gorge when I was there last year, and just last<br/>
Monday.  You also did a good job re-creating Der Mad Stamper's<br/>
Ponytail Falls and Wahkeena Falls stamps.  I checked on<br/>
the Horsetail Falls box while going for Ponytail and could<br/>
not find it.  I stamped into it last year (didn't know about<br/>
your re-creations then) and it was not where I remembered it<br/>
was supposed to be.  There was a plastic bag filled with mud<br/>
in the spot so not sure if the box is missing or if my memory<br/>
is bad.  Anyway, if you have time you might want to be prepared<br/>
to replace this one since you did such a good job on the others.<br/>

I think I am available Saturday... late morning or early afternoon.  I even<br/>
have one of the boxes that was retired from the Creek Trail.  Funhog was the<br/>
last stamp in that one before it went away.  There is another box that was<br/>
originally placed in an area that has since been closed off.  If I can dig<br/>
up the clues, we could see if it is still out there.  I have been planning<br/>
to service these boxes (with some prompting by wingnut and others).  I have<br/>
some new logs to place &amp; could prolly recreate the stamps onsite.<br/>

That would be great!  I always feel guilty about replacing other <br/>
people's boxes, and letting the creator of the boxes replace them is <br/>
always so much better!  =)  <br/>
<br/>
I carved a recreation of the stamp in box #3 thinking that box was <br/>
MIA quite awhile ago.  (I do remember it being missing, although now <br/>
I fear it was "retired" and you actually have it!)<br/>
<br/>
Which other stamps need recarving?  Box 6 went missing on the great <br/>
Earth Day Event (my first "event" *sniffle*) and was the only one I <br/>
didn't manage to nab before it disappeared.  Box 7 I remembered <br/>
checking and was definitely MIA and can recarve that stamp.  The <br/>
other boxes--I'm not sure what the status of them are and figured I'd <br/>
try recarving them onsite if they were missing.<br/>
<br/>
How about for anyone wanting to get in on the fun meet at the <br/>
location for the Tualatin Nature Series, box numero uno.  (That's box <br/>
number one for those of you that don't speak Spanish. *wink*)  At <br/>
high noon.  <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that'll work.  I can check up on the Murder at Gabriel Park <br/>
earlier in the morning and meet anyone who's interested at box #1 of <br/>
the Tualatin Nature Park series at around noon.  (I'm not expecting a <br/>
large turnout given the last-minute nature of this 'gathering'.)<br/>
<br/>
Woo-who!  What fun!  You'll be able to recognize me 'cause I'll <br/>
probably be the only person wearing a Zorro mask.  ;o)<br/>

Glad you enjoyed them!  =)  They're some of my best stamps, but being <br/>
off the beaten letterboxing path (figuratively speaking) they don't <br/>
get nearly the traffic that the city park letterboxes do.  Which of <br/>
the Gorge boxes of mine did you find?  I'd like to update the status <br/>
of those boxes on my clues so people know they're still there!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You also did a good job re-creating Der Mad Stamper's<br/>
&gt; Ponytail Falls and Wahkeena Falls stamps.  I checked on<br/>
&gt; the Horsetail Falls box while going for Ponytail and could<br/>
&gt; not find it.<br/>
<br/>
I hide a replacement if necessary, but I don't think I'll be able to <br/>
make it out on this particular trip.  Perhaps next, though!  Assuming <br/>
it's actually gone in the first place.  I remember reading that a <br/>
prominent landmark for the Horsetail Falls box was missing making it <br/>
much more difficult to find, but this is the first I've heard that it <br/>
might actually be missing.<br/>

Well, let me put it this way.  My intention is definitely to show up <br/>
in Portland this weekend, but I added in the "tentative" part in case <br/>
I got cold feet and wanted to back out.  ;o)  I'm not really planning <br/>
for that, though!  I *have* to get to Oregon by the end of the month <br/>
if for no other reason than to renew the registration on my car.  <br/>
This weekend seemed as good as time as any.<br/>

Did anyone offer you a roof?<br/>

I don't know.  Probably around 9:00 or so?<br/>
<br/>
I also don't know how long I'll be there.  If none of my boxes are <br/>
missing, I don't plan to stick around very long.  If one or more are <br/>
missing, I'll have to recarve and hide them and might be there for <br/>
hours.  It all depends!  Which is probably why it'll be easier to <br/>
find me at Tualatin Hills Nature Park.<br/>

Yeah, a couple of people, in fact!  =)<br/>

&gt;&gt; How Tentative are these Plans????<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In my case they were waaayyyyy tentative.  I ended up sick in bed all<br/>
weekend with some kind of flu-like deal.  Now Sue has gotten the same thing<br/>
and she hasn't yet emerged today.  I feel really bad about missing this<br/>
outing.  I also looked forward to reading about it today.... did anyone go<br/>
or show?<br/>

Well, you see, it was like this; Pandora, Punkin (I mean Iron Bear) <br/>
Cat's Meow and I were boxing in the Beaverton area on Saturday and <br/>
thought we would drop on by Tualatin Nature Park to see if we could <br/>
collect any exchanges and we see this poor scrawning-looking guy <br/>
sitting all alone carving something and minding his own business. He <br/>
looked so lonely that we thought we would drag him along to make him <br/>
show us where the boxes for this series were. We scored with 5 out of <br/>
8 and if it weren't for the scrawny guy we wouldn't have gotten them. <br/>
We then felt so sorry for him that we took him to lunch and made him <br/>
show us where Pooch Place at Willow Creek was. After threatening him <br/>
that we would hang him by his heels in the stream if he didn't tell <br/>
us where the box was he complied and to our horror the box was <br/>
missing. We cheered him up by letting him romp around the soccer <br/>
field with Cat's Meow and listened to his boring stories about his <br/>
travels. It was getting very dark and we still couldn't get rid of <br/>
him so I just left him with poor Pandora and Punkin (I mean Iron <br/>
Bear) and headed home. No one has seen hide nor hair of the scrawny <br/>
guy since. Hmmm. Maybe the guy in the black mask and wig knows where <br/>
he ended up.<br/>
