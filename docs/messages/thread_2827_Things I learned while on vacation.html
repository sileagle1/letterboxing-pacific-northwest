great boxes I got to find on a PREcent trip! <br/>
<br/>
Here's a silly add-on to one of my own posts on AQ just for you <br/>
Portlanders or passers-through....<br/>

<br/>
On a much more serious note...now that I've had a few days to get over <br/>
my disappointment at my Art Exposure box having gone missing, I think <br/>
I'd like to try and PRE-place this box...<br/>
<br/>
No great hurry, mind you, as I'm not gonna miss out on what remains of <br/>
the Rocky Mountain summer until I go into the Carving Cave...but if any <br/>
Portland-area boxers who's already found this box would be interested <br/>
in helping me out...I'd love to chat off list... Before doing so, what <br/>
I REALLY need to know is:<br/>
<br/>
Could the original hiding spot really BE magnetic?? I don't have it in <br/>
my notes other than the round box I placed "no worky" and I'm thinking <br/>
it was due to size/shape, but this blonde can't remember and didn't <br/>
tote along a magnet on recent trip to Czech it out.  But I'm definitely <br/>
thinking magnetic, big time, to replace this box...if <br/>
possible ...in/near original spot. I'm on a Need to Know basis before I <br/>
start carving, etc/etal for size/other considerations.<br/>
<br/>
I will also say I cruised dat hood for hours on the first round..Holy <br/>
Urban box o rama, this one's tricky, but CAN be done I just KNOW it if <br/>
you'd like to play along with pre...<br/>
<br/>
Anyone willing to Work With Me? Into fall, winter, spring <br/>
perhaps...really no hurry, but I sure would like to try!  I LOVED <br/>
everything about this box and am just gonna trust...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
