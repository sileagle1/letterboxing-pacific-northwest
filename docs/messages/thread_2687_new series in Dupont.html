Get on I-5 toward Seattle. Take Exit 118 Dupont/Steilacoom. Follow the<br>
road to the first red light, McNeil St, make a left. Make a left and<br>
follow McNeil through two traffic circles. Where Ridgeview meets<br>
McNeil there is a small park with a small side parking area.<br>
<br>
Head 200 degrees on the sidewalk and walk up Ridgeview away from the<br>
park. Walk till you come to a gravel path and a pedestrian crossing<br>
sign. Turn right and head up the path.<br>
<br>
This is a Nature Growth Protection Easement. Enjoy the view and breeze<br>
as the path takes a turn. After the turn there is a NCPE sign, once<br>
you pass the second sign stop and look around. On the left is a tall<br>
percolating coffee pot, here on the SW side, you will find a shot of<br>
energy to keep you on your way.<br>
<br>
Back on the trail you will walk up down and up again. You will see an<br>
old fellow ready to share a cup of tea anytime of day. His table is to<br>
the left of the path, set and ready for Tea time.<br>
<br>
Continue to the end of the path and enjoy the chilly, breezy view.<br>
It's now time for Coco, so here is what you do. Turn around and head<br>
back down the path. At the fork in the path (one way you can not go)<br>
count 27 steps. This takes you to a tree standing tall on the left. In<br>
this tree is a Chocolate lover's delight. Look high not low for a warm<br>
winter's drink<br>
