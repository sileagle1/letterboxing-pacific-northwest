that Dog Scouts participate in and something we'll be doing at the first <br/>
meeting of the currently forming Portland/Gresham area troop.  I'd love to <br/>
have any interested letterboxers join us.  Also, I'll be placing a Dog <br/>
Scout related box in Vance Park about a week before the meeting and it <br/>
would be great if some local letterboxers could stamp in so that the new <br/>
letterboxers have something to see.  (I'll post it here when I do)<br/>

Subject: [dsapdx] Dog Scout Troop Status, Mailing List, and First Get Together<br/>
<br/>
I'm sending this to everyone who has contacted me about a troop in the<br/>
East Portland/Gresham area.<br/>
<br/>
First, our troop status - in order to be an official troop, we need 3<br/>
more people/families to join Dog Scouts of America.  Being a member of<br/>
the organization gives you access to many membership resources, allows<br/>
your dog to gain the Dog Scout and Pack Dog titles, and will be a<br/>
requirement for participating in troop activities.  You can join<br/>
online or print a membership form at<br/>
http://www.dogscouts.org/Membership.html<br/>
<br/>
I have started a Yahoo group for the troop, unimaginatively named<br/>
dsapdx, you can join at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dsapdx/join<br/>
All events and activities will be announced and discussed there and I<br/>
hope you will join even if you aren't sure if you want to join the<br/>
troop.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, we will be having our first get together Saturday<br/>
October 24th at 1pm in Vance Park.  We'll be meeting on the north end<br/>
(the end next to Park Place Coffee) under / around the big pine tree.<br/>
<br/>
Vance Park is on 181st between SE Stark and SE Division.  It has a<br/>
Portland address, but is a Gresham city park.  There is a map here -<br/>
http://tinyurl.com/yhzpp28<br/>
<br/>
We will practice polite dog greetings and go looking for the letterbox<br/>
in the park.  And yes, we will be meeting rain or shine, this is<br/>
Oregon. :-)  The meeting is open to everyone, but I recommend that you<br/>
only bring one dog per person.<br/>
<br/>
Before the meeting, please read the article "Teaching dogs to greet<br/>
each other politely" from the Dog Scouts site:<br/>
<br/>
 http://www.dogscouts.org/uploads/Teaching_dogs_to_greet_each_other_politely_1_.doc<br/>
<br/>
OR http://tinyurl.com/politedog<br/>
<br/>
You may also want to read about letterboxing on www.letterboxing.org<br/>
or www.atlasquest.com  There is a letterboxing badge, but unless your<br/>
dog already has and is trained to wear a pack, getting this letterbox<br/>
will not count toward the badge (but you can always come back for it<br/>
and you will learn what you need to to earn the badge on your own.)<br/>
<br/>
What to bring:<br/>
Poop Cleanup Bags (at least 3)<br/>
Dog water bowl<br/>
Dog treats (LOTS of Dog Treats!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing supplies if you have them<br/>
Your dogs personal stamp (you can start with any rubber stamp)<br/>
Letterboxing log book or paper<br/>
Stamp pad<br/>
Pen<br/>
Compass<br/>
Dog Backpack and Backpacking supplies (http://tinyurl.com/packdog)<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you October 24th!<br/>
<br/>
Julie<br/>

PS A troop has just started in Vancouver, WA.  If that is a better<br/>
match for you, contact Alison at dsatroop192@aol.com<br/>
