found the Cape Blanco letterbox!  =)  I've probably had nearly a <br>
dozen different people e-mail me saying they couldn't find it and <br>
thought it was missing, but no more!  At long, long last, one person <br>
has found it!<br>
<br>
And get this....  the person found it by ACCIDENT!  Never heard of <br>
letterboxing before, but found it and thought, "What the heck is <br>
this?"  Turns out they were the first (and only) people to ever find <br>
it!<br>
<br>
So...  advice for all you people that haven't been able to find it: <br>
The box IS still there, but you might do better if you stop looking <br>
for it and let it come to you.  ;o)<br>
