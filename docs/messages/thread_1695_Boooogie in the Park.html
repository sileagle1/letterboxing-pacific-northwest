Oh, good idea about bringing Scout Uniforms. I thought we should attend, but<br>

Basically, you bring one item that you'd like to share and make enough to<br>
feed a group of people.  Since the event is scheduled through lunch time,<br>
we're having the potluck.  In the past Team Rayvenhaus has supplied<br>
burgers and dogs for all to feast on, however, this year times are very,<br>
very lean and we just can't afford it this time.<br>
<br>
It's not really a balanced table at all at a potluck kinda thing, it's<br>
more the hit or miss kinda thing really. (smiles)<br>
<br>
There's no wrong way to do it really. Some bring enough just for them if<br>
they have special dietary requirements. Other bring enough of something to<br>
feed an army. Others bring barely enough to share and, of course, that's<br>
what everyone wants. (lol)  You put what you bring on the table and<br>
everyone shares.  I think we're going to bring the (in)Famous Rayvenhaus<br>
Baked Beans and maybe rolls.<br>
<br>
I'll say this much... It'll all work out and the important thing is that<br>
you attend.  Getting to meet the wonderful people in this area are what's<br>
important.  ;o)<br>
