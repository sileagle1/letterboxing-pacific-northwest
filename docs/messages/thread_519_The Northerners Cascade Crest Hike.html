The Northerner is a Letterboxer who is doing a through hike on the <br>
Pacific Crest trail.<br>
<br>
His journal is wonderful.  For anyone who enjoys simple but <br>
thoughtful nature observations, ponderings of life and the <br>
appreciation for the little things, this is a must read.<br>
<br>
It is up to date through July 20.  I check about once a week, he <br>
usually downloads a batch of entries.<br>
<br>
He has tried for some boxes along the way and, for the most part come <br>
up empty.  He asked for suggested boxes in Oregon and Washington, <br>
along the crest.<br>
<br>
If he continues his successful trip, I suggest a boxing get <br>
together.  I have a plant in mind that would not be far from the <br>
crest.  Stamp already carved.<br>
