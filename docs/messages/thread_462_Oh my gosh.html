I attemped to claim some boxes back but I am not sure if I was successful or not. The Grotto, Canadian Walk, Candle in the Wind, Goofy Pub Names, I sent emails on as I noticed the Mexico series was adopted and the Clowns were adopted which is wonderful thanks. I am not sure if there are any others I placed. The Sigfried one was reported missing a while ago:( bummer that was my best one. So do we need to do this same thing for all the ones with placed in Canada?????<br>
Thanks guys for the heads up.<br>

I haven't officially adopted the Mexico series yet.  I was holding off for a <br>
few days to see what happened.  If you want to keep them, that'd be great!!  <br>
Let me know!<br>
