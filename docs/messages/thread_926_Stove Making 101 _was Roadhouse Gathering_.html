I'll try and make it.  That's assuming I'm not still in California <br>
after the Thanksgiving holidays visiting friends and family.  When <br>
you don't work, you can take "extra long" vacations, you know.  ;o)  <br>
I don't actually have many prints of my adventures, but Amanda has a <br>
number of them I'll try to borrow if I can make it.<br>

Alrighty, then, a MacGyver stove class it is.  Anyone interested must <br>
bring at least two soda cans (extra in case you think you might make <br>
a mistake).  Pepsi and Coke cans seems to work well.<br>
<br>
If you REALLY want to make a MacGyver stove, there are directions for <br>
it online at http://www.pcthiker.com/pages/gear/pepsistove.shtml <br>
which is what I used to make my stove.  They list a lot of other <br>
optional tools (screwdriver, sand paper, drill bits, file, cardboard, <br>
etc.).  You don't really need any of that.  Two soda cans at the very <br>
least.  Scissors, X-acto knife, and something thin and sharp (certain <br>
nails work) are highly desireable.  Those are essential for making a <br>
stove, but you can use mine if you didn't bring it.  (Which may <br>
entail a wait if someone else is using them at the time.)  The rest <br>
really is optional and to experience the rugged simpleness of the <br>
trail, we won't be using any of the rest.  ;o)<br>

THAT is totally cool.  We are getting ready to make the traditional "buddy<br>
burners" with tuna cans & cardboard for my son's Webelo Den.  I think I may<br>
build one of these to show them the "next level."<br>

Yes, certain Nails do work while others only clean up piles of <br>
