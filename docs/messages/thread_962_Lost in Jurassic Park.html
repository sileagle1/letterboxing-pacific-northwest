<br>
"headed onto the trail of the Jurassic Park series. WELLL, 1.5 hours <br>
later<br>
we had found only box 3 and were hopelessly lost. It took us a good <br>
long<br>
time to find our way back to the parking lot. We finally did and <br>
found the<br>
Clackamas River stamp before calling it a night."<br>
<br>
I don't know how you got so lost, but I hope you don't give up. The <br>
Making Faces series following Jurassic park is really fun.<br>

Happy Hunting,<br>
