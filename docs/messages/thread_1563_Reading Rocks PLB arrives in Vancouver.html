                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone -<br>
A new postal letterbox has arrived in Vancouver, Washington. Some of us are getting together on Friday September 3rd at 6 PM at Barnes and Noble. After some stamping at Barnes and Noble, some of us are going to pizza at Round Table. Anyone who wishes may join us. Please bring a book to exchange, in honor of the postal box. The owner of this box said - the more the merrier. There are slots for FIVE books to be placed into the postal letterbox before being sent out. These five books must have a Book Crossing ID Number. Go to http://bookcrossing.org/ for more information about book crossing. Most of the slots for the books that will be placed into the postal are taken. However, feel free to bring a book just to exchange with someone else. <br>
Which Barnes and Noble? WELL....you figure it out - The B&N is in Vancouver, it's by Pupp's place of employment, near the Stop the Stigma letterbox, off 500, near 4th plain, by a Winco, Petsmart, Chuck E Cheese, a movie theatre, Office Max, and a Michaels. Oh, and a Target and Bed, Bath and Beyond. It's also very near 205. If you get stuck, just ask  somone, LOL. <br>
Any questions? Just email. <br>
Please let me know if you are planning on coming. If I get enough interest, I'll carve an event stamp. (And, yes, Pandora, you can come do my dishes beforehand, I'm carving the stamp right now! LOLOLOLOL)<br>
