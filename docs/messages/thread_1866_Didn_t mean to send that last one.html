&gt; Rats!  That last post was supposed to go just to<br/>
&gt; Maiden.  Is there a way to delete your own goof, or<br/>
&gt; does the moderator have to do that?<br/>
<br/>
Ah, yes, no need to fret.  Everyone makes that mistake on occasion. <br/>
=)  And yes, you can delete your own posts.  If you're looking at a<br/>
message, you should see a link that says 'Delete' just under the<br/>
"Messages" listing.  (At least you'll see it for your own posts--not<br/>
for other people's posts!)<br/>
<br/>
However, being a moderator, I can delete them for you as well and will<br/>
do so.  =)  I'll also delete your reply since you quoted the message<br/>
you wanted deleted in the first place!<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, however, some people choose to receive messages as e-mail<br/>
or as digests, and there's no way to take this back.  Messages can be<br/>
deleted from the archives, but you can't recall e-mails!  So some<br/>
people will always get the message.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
