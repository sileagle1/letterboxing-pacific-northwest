Ah, yes, no need to fret.  Everyone makes that mistake on occasion. <br>
=)  And yes, you can delete your own posts.  If you're looking at a<br>
message, you should see a link that says 'Delete' just under the<br>
"Messages" listing.  (At least you'll see it for your own posts--not<br>
for other people's posts!)<br>
<br>
However, being a moderator, I can delete them for you as well and will<br>
do so.  =)  I'll also delete your reply since you quoted the message<br>
you wanted deleted in the first place!<br>
<br>
As an aside, however, some people choose to receive messages as e-mail<br>
or as digests, and there's no way to take this back.  Messages can be<br>
deleted from the archives, but you can't recall e-mails!  So some<br>
people will always get the message.<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>
