Hi all,<br/>
Last Saturday, Elisa and I met with about 20-25 Letterboxing<br/>
enthusiasts to discuss letterboxing in District parks.  Our focus <br/>
was<br/>
primarily to introduce ourselves to the Letterboxing community <br/>
and to<br/>
encourage the activity, especially since it is a great <br/>
family-oriented<br/>
activity that we promote at the Nature Park.  We asked that they <br/>
monitor<br/>
and maintain their boxes and that they consider the safety aspect <br/>
of the<br/>
letterbox locations (steep streambanks, poison-oak, etc.).  We <br/>
also<br/>
asked that letterboxes be adopted by another person if the <br/>
original<br/>
letterbox owner is unable to maintain them.<br/>
<br/>
There are currently about 30 letterboxes in 16 parks, though <br/>
some are<br/>
not being maintained and may be missing or in disrepair.  I have <br/>
located<br/>
a small handful just to familiarize myself with the activity and only<br/>
found a couple that I felt posed a minor hazard to either the <br/>
hiders or<br/>
the seekers.  I've contacted the owners and apprized them of my <br/>
concerns<br/>
and they have been cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
Elisa and I suggested a Letterboxing event (such as the <br/>
Geocaching<br/>
Ridgewood View Park clean-up last May) that would encourage a <br/>
sense of<br/>
stewardship of a park or parks and which would offer an <br/>
opportunity for<br/>
the Letterboxers to promote the activity to people that may not <br/>
know<br/>
about it.  I also suggested a Letterboxing class at the NP (like the<br/>
Geocaching class) to teach families about the fun activity and <br/>
maybe to<br/>
give them the chance to carve their own Letterboxing stamp.  <br/>
They could<br/>
then seek the letterboxes in the NP as a starting point for finding<br/>
other letterboxes in the District and the region.<br/>
