But you know something, if those Outsiders made up their own board, <br/>
I'm sure we'd have a couple of spies to keep an eye on them too.  ;o)<br/>

Oh Chief Fruit Loop, did you disable the members list for this group? I could have sworn I saw it before... I saw another east coast person on it, but won't say the famous name because now I am not sure if I saw it on the page for this list or the other one. (: <br/>

lurker<br/>
------<br/>
n. One of the 'silent majority' in a electronic forum;<br/>
one who posts occasionally or not at all but is known to read the<br/>
group's postings regularly. This term is not pejorative and indeed<br/>
is casually used reflexively: "Oh, I'm just lurking." Often used in<br/>
'the lurkers', the hypothetical audience for the group's<br/>
flamage-emitting regulars. When a lurker speaks up for the first<br/>
time, this is called 'delurking'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm delurking now.<br/>

Of course, the potentate (err, Potentate) knew I was here all along.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Oh Chief Fruit Loop, did you disable the members list for this<br/>
&gt; group? I could have sworn I saw it before...<br/>
<br/>
That was one of the first things I decided to disable.  I figured if <br/>
some people want to be anonymous lurkers, they should have the right <br/>
to be one!  =)  It's unlikely you saw any other well-known "spies" <br/>
before I disabled it, since it was one of the first things I <br/>
disabled.  I don't think there *were* any other members besides <br/>
myself at the time I disabled it!<br/>
<br/>
Be that as it may, I never figured the members list was particularly <br/>
useful.  I've never had any trouble finding contact info for someone <br/>
I wanted to contact--either on the clue, on their website, or a reply <br/>
to one of their posts to the board.<br/>
<br/>
But actually, the main reason I disabled it was because I'm <br/>
paranoid.  =)  Having gone to school majoring in computer science and <br/>
working in the industry (yes, I used to work!!!!), I learned two <br/>
things about software:<br/>
<br/>
1. The more features and extras that are enabled, the less secure a <br/>
system becomes.<br/>
<br/>
2. The more features and extras that are available, the more it <br/>
intimidates those that aren't especially computer savy!  If you've <br/>
ever wondered why "user-friendly" isn't, that's probably the number <br/>
one reason!<br/>
<br/>
Now #1 isn't a very big problem here--top notch security on a board <br/>
that anyone is allowed to join is kind of silly.  But still, why make <br/>
it easier for a spammer to join and send all sorts of junk to <br/>
everyone?  If they really want to do it, they'll still be able to, <br/>
but maybe they'd go to a different board instead where they wouldn't <br/>
have to jump through as many hoops to get the same thing done?<br/>
<br/>
But #2 I felt was a very valid concern, since not everyone that <br/>
enjoys letterboxing is a computer scientist.  So I disabled anything <br/>
that I thought nobody would miss.  <br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to delete the polling feature since I've never <br/>
personally created a poll and felt it would be easy to live without, <br/>
but some people seem to love it for planning events, so I left it <br/>
in.  While I didn't have much use for it, I knew others might.<br/>
<br/>
Let's vote on it--if you think that feature should be kept, say yes!<br/>
<br/>
That's a joke, people.  *rolling eyes*  =)  Even though I think we'd <br/>
live fine without it, I don't see any harm in leaving it there.<br/>
<br/>
But the one feature I REALLY wanted to disable was the Files <br/>
section.  I see that feature as a ticking time bomb just waiting to <br/>
cause trouble.  Probably because someone creates a clue using <br/>
Microsoft Word and innocently uploads it not realizing it's been <br/>
infected with a virus or some other similar senario.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, I decided to leave the feature in mostly because it <br/>
appears that it's inexplicably tied to the photos feature, which IS a <br/>
terrific feature!  But I can't get rid of one without getting rid of <br/>
the other.  I love seeing pictures of events and signature stamps, <br/>
and whatever other pictures people upload.  I can't belive the darned <br/>
idiots that programed this system set it up that way.  Irresponsible!<br/>
<br/>
So anyhow, if you ever do decide to download any files--even if it's <br/>
been put there by someone you know and love--it would probably be <br/>
best to assume the worst and at the very least run a virus checker <br/>
over it.  Yahoo Groups might do that automatically--I'm not sure--but <br/>
even if they do, a second check wouldn't hurt.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, if nobody ever makes use of the Files feature, that <br/>
would be perfectly okay by me!  But I do hope the Photos section gets <br/>
lots of action.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Hmm....  I seem to have strayed quite a bit from the original subject <br/>
of disable the members list.  I disabled it thinking it would rarely <br/>
be useful for anyone, but I would reconsider enabling it if there's a <br/>
large demand for the feature.  Are there many people out there who <br/>
are dieing to have that feature available?<br/>

This is a valid point. There is also a huge annoyance factor with these Yahoo "features." You have to log in. I don't have a Yahoo ID associated with my email address, and if a site uses the files features and all those other things, I just never see them. I do all the mailing lists via email (subscribe, unsubscribe, change to digest mode, change to normal mode, etc.). Much easier that way. Though you can end up with very irritating people who keep clicking on the "request profile" thing in the members' list section. I have left a few lists because of that. The profile thing is usually a lie anyway -- I certainly never use any of my real information there... This is the internet, after all. (:  <br/>

No demand here. (: <br/>

But seriously, the best way to see what it does--check out the <br/>
members list on the main letterboxing group.  It's enabled on that <br/>
