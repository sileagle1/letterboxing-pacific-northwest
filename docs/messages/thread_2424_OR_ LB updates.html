pleasure of finding a couple wonderful letterboxes that really merit <br/>
more attention than they're receiving.  I hope Funhog doesn't mind <br/>
me posting this about them.  If you want to enjoy some great views--<br/>
check out the great letterboxes at Bald Peak.  Not sure where the <br/>
clue to one of them is anymore (I stumbled upon it in a book of <br/>
clues I pre-printed about 3-1/2 years ago) but they're probably <br/>
retrievable if you search through the letterbox-usa archive from <br/>
back in 2002 sometime.  <br/>
::<br/>
If you're into birding or gorgeous views of the river or hills, <br/>
check out Funhog's Bluebird Trail letterbox in Shampooey. ;)  We <br/>
didn't see any bluebirds at that park but we were extremely <br/>
fortunate to get to see about a dozen of them while boxing atop Bald <br/>
Peak--so work the two outings together if you must go during 'off' <br/>
bluebird season.  It was odd that there weren't more visitors to <br/>
this box--given its close proximity to the metro area and its <br/>
gorgeous venue with great visitor center.  I faintly recall a note <br/>
about somebody not being able to find it years ago and have a <br/>
sneaking suspicion that this 'false missing' report wound its way <br/>
into the hearts and minds of area boxers--thus leading to the mere <br/>
trickle of visitors over the years.  Take joy, it is alive &amp; <br/>
well!!!  The clues, venues &amp; stamps of these letterboxes are SO <br/>
WORTH the effort to track them down!  Enjoy your adventure!!!<br/>

deux), I found 'em.  In the spirit of maintaining letterboxing's <br/>
mystique, try poking around usa's letterbox around Jun 02. You gotta <br/>
work for something here! ;) I've attempted to contact the owners (Mark <br/>
&amp; Beth) to let them know their box isn't missing but their email <br/>
address listed on yahoo is bouncing. Enjoy the adventure!<br/>
