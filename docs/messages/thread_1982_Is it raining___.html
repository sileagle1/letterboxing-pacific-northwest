Hitchhikers, that is???  As we're departing tomorrow for a prolonged <br>
trip to the lands of the morning calm & the dragons (with nary a <br>
letterbox :( apart from the few we planted on a previous visit), we <br>
hustled to scatter a handful of hitchhikers we had collected over the <br>
past couple of months from several distant regions from around the US.  <br>
We didn't want them growing too stagnant. <br>
<br>
If you have a yearning to do some boxing in the relatively unvisited <br>
South Sound, then you may be greatly rewarded. Birds, ghosts, forts, <br>
nooses, conestoga wagons & big trees may help hone your compass a bit...<br>
<br>
Enjoy & see y'all on the flip side!  Anyonghikayseyo!<br>
