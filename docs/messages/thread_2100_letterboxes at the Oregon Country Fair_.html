<br/>
I was wondering if anyone here attends the Oregon Country Fair outside<br/>
of Eugene, OR in July?<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of making a three day only letterbox just for the<br/>
ocassion at the fair. I just have to think of some place to put it<br/>
where no one would find it. (I gets crazy and very very crowded; I<br/>
think I would need to get permission to place it somewhere. Maybe in a<br/>
booth?)<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone be interested in this? Would I get anyone to stamp in?<br/>

carving a stamp of the Oregon Country Fair logo and was going to plant<br/>
it as a limit time letterbox for the month of July.  I know several<br/>
people who work the fair every year and will ask them their thoughts<br/>
on putting something inside but for mine I think I will find a place<br/>
outside so it can be left for the entire month. I live on the coast<br/>
and will be going there next week (monthly shopping at Costco ect.)<br/>
and plan to scout out the area for an appropriate spot. I did attend<br/>
the fair a couple of times in the past but it is so hot, dusty &amp;<br/>
crowded that the only time I would consider going in would be Friday<br/>
evening. <br/>
<br/>
Also I am still deciding about attending the Silver Falls gathering<br/>
and could be interested in sharing transportation.  Not sure how it<br/>
can be worked out but if I go it will be either Fri evening and I<br/>
would probably stay in a motel that nite and go back the next morning<br/>
or only go for the day on Sat.  That leaves our paths crossing only on<br/>
Sat morning from Eugene to Silver Falls. Something to think about. <br/>

<br/>
I am one of the people that work there! We are headed up there<br/>
tommorow. It is a very good idea to have one up there outside of the<br/>
fair. That way everyone will be able to find it.<br/>
<br/>
I will not carve a stamp of the logo; I'll think of something else. I<br/>
think I may still have it inside the gates, and ask around about where<br/>
I might be able to put something like that. I was thinking of leaving<br/>
it someplace right inside one of the staff gates, and making sure that<br/>
the person guarding the gate knows it is there. People will still have<br/>
to ask for it, but at least it will be safe.<br/>
<br/>
I will of course carry my stamp with me and let the board know what I<br/>
will be wearing. Maybe I will run into someone and get to do an<br/>
exchange! Friday is the only day that we will be able to get up there<br/>
this year as well.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe see you there!<br/>
