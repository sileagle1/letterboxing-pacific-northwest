I'm not around--or even when I am around for that matter.  =)  I've <br>
made Amanda from Seattle and HangGlider moderators--the only two that <br>
seemed to be really excited about the prospects of a greater level of <br>
power.  =)<br>
<br>
Everyone knows Amanda.  She's from Seattle.  =)<br>
<br>
HangGlider I suspect suffers from letterbox deprevation there in <br>
Spokane, Washington, and would love for some boxers to hide some more <br>
in that part of the world.  =)<br>
<br>
They can choose their own exalted titles to show off their new-found <br>
rank and powers.<br>
<br>
While I'm not completely clear exactly all the extra privlegdes <br>
moderators have over regular members, they *should* be able to add <br>
bookmarks to the Links section and if you want an addition, change, <br>
or deletion there, they'll be able to help when I can't.<br>
<br>
They'll also delete any spam that shows up and ban those members from <br>
posting anymore.  I've also told them to delete any posts that are <br>
nothing more than insulting, hurting, and deliberately evil in nature <br>
that might have been said in the heat of the moment.  Not to ban <br>
those members, but just remove the offending post.  <br>
<br>
While free speech advocates may not like that, I feel it would make <br>
the board better if 'discussions' that break out (and they will break <br>
out occasionally!) stuck to the issues being discussed rather than <br>
resorting to name calling and personal attacks.  Agree to disagree, <br>
but no name calling or personal attacks!<br>
<br>
Those are my only two rules for now.  No spam and no name calling or <br>
personal attacks.  I'll let you know if I think of any new rules <br>
later.  =)<br>

I think they can do anything except delete the group. Not positive, but I think that's how it works. <br>
