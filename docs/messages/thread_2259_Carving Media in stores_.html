                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I personally purchase PZ Kut via www.stampeaz.com for carving <br/>
material.  I absolutely love how durable it is and that it is easy <br/>
to carve.  It's the least expensive material, to boot--so it wins <br/>
HANDS DOWN for me.  Runs about $5 a sheet (maybe 10"x6"x0.25"?).<br/>
<br/>
As for 'in store' type carving material:<br/>
<br/>
I'm familiar with Speed Ball's white and pink carving medium <br/>
available from various art/craft stores.  I've personaly found it at <br/>
Michael's Craft Stores.   I recommend the pink stuff for serious <br/>
carvers/LB planters and I really dislike the white stuff (even the <br/>
kind that's labelled new &amp; improved).  The white stuff runs about $5 <br/>
dollars for a large block of it in a size that is comparable to the <br/>
PZ Kut size.  Only difference is that the quality is awful!  It's <br/>
easy to carve but it crumbles easily and letterbox stamps carved out <br/>
of it usually must be replaced a few months after being planted.  <br/>
The pink stuff runs about $9 for a block that is about 1/3 the size <br/>
of the PZ Kut block.  It rivals the quality of PZ Kut.  If you're <br/>
planning on carving/planting many letterboxes and frugality is a <br/>
concern, I'd go for the PZ Kut.  If you just want some small blocks <br/>
to use then go for the pink stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Mars Carve--I've experimented with Mars Carve in both the thick and <br/>
thin blocks.  They're the same material that high quality Staedtler <br/>
erasers are made with.  They carve like butter but also don't afford <br/>
much room for mistakes if you accidentally carve a bit TOO much from <br/>
a design as the material is so easy to carve.  It's durable in a <br/>
letterbox, though and many folks prefer it.  I'm not familiar with <br/>
prices for it but I think I recall it being comparable to Speed <br/>
Ball's pink stuff--although it's much thicker in a block.  You can <br/>
usually find this at high end market type art supply stores.<br/>
<br/>
I heard that Art Co (?) in Tacoma has Speed Ball supplies that are <br/>
less expensive than Michael's.  I'm sure there are other stores but <br/>
I just don't get out shopping all that much (hence the online <br/>
purchases).  ;)<br/>
<br/>
When visiting these stores, most employees won't have any idea what <br/>
you're looking for.  Speedball is usually found in the linoleum <br/>
block carving section (used for silk screening and such).  I have <br/>
never visited two Michael's Craft Stores that are organized in a <br/>
similar manner--so I usually end up walking down every single aisle <br/>
looking for it.  <br/>
<br/>
As a note for folks who may want to purchase the PZ Kut--financially <br/>
it makes sense to buy 4-5 sheets at a time because the postage &amp; <br/>
handling is the same as it is for 1 sheet.  So, that's usually how I <br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, if for some reason you can't find the 'true' carving medium, <br/>
dollar store erasers work just as well!  I used those for a while <br/>
before I transitioned over to PZ Kut.  If you find the right kind of <br/>
plastic/rubber flexible erasers than you've probably found a very <br/>
similar material to what is used in the carving medium blocks.<br/>
<br/>
As for Michael's locations near the gathering:  <br/>
<br/>
Tacoma:  38th St in Tacoma (West of Costco, Chevys in the Michael's <br/>
Plaza)--about 1.5 miles West of I-5<br/>
<br/>
Lakewood:  in the Lakewood Mall about 5 miles from Ft Steilacoom <br/>
Park (but I can't provide exact driving directions off the top of my <br/>
head).  I presume this would be in mapquest, though.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this info helps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">dvn2rckr covered it pretty well, but a couple of things I thought I'd add...<br/>
<br/>
The carving stuff is often tough to find at Michael's, like she said, but I often look for the wood carving stuff, since sometimes they're nearby.  You might want to call the stores first, too, since some Michael's with more limited space will eliminate that part of their merchandise, not being extraordinarily popular.  (Why they can't spend a little less space on fake flowers I'll never understand...)<br/>
<br/>
I always learned in art class to call it linoleum block or lino block for carving, but I asked about that at Michael's once and the guy had NO clue what I was talking about.  He told me to look at a hardware store...haha.  Another lady directed me to the wood carving section, not telling me they didn't have it and that she was just trying to get me to buy wood carving stuff and go away.  I think it's best to just wander...it's also fun!<br/>
<br/>
If you're okay with limiting your space to eraser size, I suggest the three-pack white erasers you can find at Fred Meyer stores.  They're in the school supply section, usually hung up on a bar thing with the pencils and pens on cardboard covered in plastic.  They carve really easily, but the edges are not square (they're a little rounded) which can make for some graded edges on the stamped image, but you can just carve a non-rounded edge and you're fine.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer the pink stuff dvn2r mentioned, and have been pretty disappointed in some of the white stuff, too.  The stuff I've tried is actually more of a beige, and usually so crumbly I can't hardly carve anything out of it.  It took some extensive practice to come up with anything good.<br/>
<br/>
So this ended up a little longer than I meant, but happy shopping!!<br/>
