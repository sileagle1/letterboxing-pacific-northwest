I grew up in interior Alaska, and I have taken a part of one of these cruises, a long, long <br>
time ago.  Since I was coming from north of where the ferries travel, I obviously didn't take <br>
the Bellingham part of it.<br>

If you're talking about onboard ship, you didn't need a tent when I went.  It was so long <br>
ago, though (more than 20 years!) that I'd check with the ferry staff to be sure.  Would <br>
hate for you to find that you needed one only after you got there.  I'd probably also check <br>
with them to see what they recommend for the sleeping bags--it can be downright chilly <br>
when the wind hits you from the water!  Though I do seem to recall that if you wanted to <br>
there was a place indoors (with windows all the way around) you could retreat to if you got <br>
too cold.<br>
<br>
If you ever end up getting farther north, you should also check out Mt. Denali National <br>
Park.  (Denali is the Alaska native name for Mt. McKinley, and is the official name used in <br>
the park.)  The Alaska Railroad has a train that goes to the park from Anchorage.  The <br>
train itself is fun because there is an observation car and the railroad goes through places <br>
you can't get to by car.  If you do manage to get to the park, make sure to find out about <br>
the bus tour.  It goes through sections of the park that are off-limits to tourists, so you <br>
get to see the animals who don't have any contact with humans in their natural habitat.  <br>
(You aren't allowed to leave the bus, but they stop and let you watch animals that they <br>
see.)  A friend of mine who went saw all kinds of bear, moose, caribou... and the park <br>
itself is absolutely lovely.<br>

Yes, I read the recent article but I had already explored taking the <br>
trip last summer--even priced it with the car back then (too expensive) <br>
but life took a different turn when I had to spend the summer studying <br>
with Uncle Sam instead.  So, now in our frantic attempt to see <br>
everything before we leave that's the one BIG thing we still want to do <br>
before we move.   I priced it again this year one way to Juneau for 3 <br>
of us without a car and it was about $380.  I'm not sure where all <br>
these articles come up with kids going free because the ferry's website <br>
charges for kids.  I think the travel writers are going by outdated <br>
info or they found a different ferry system?  In many respects the <br>
cruise packages seem to be better deals especially because they include <br>
all meals, accommodations, and definite port calls but I often wonder <br>
if monster taxes and fees are in addition to what they quote in the <br>
ads?  Yes, that's my dilemma--trying to determine if it's really worth <br>
the hassle of going the 'ferry' route versus taking the 'cheesy' cruise <br>
instead.  That's why I was soliciting info from the letterboxing crowd--<br>
seeing if folks thought it was worth it to go the 'sleeping bag' route <br>
vice the 'bug-bed laden sheets on a cruising bacteria collecting ship' <br>
instead.  The ferry route would almost certainly preclude us from <br>
letterboxing, so that's definitely a drawback but I wonder how feasible <br>
it would be to letterbox on a package cruise deal, too? <br>

We placed a box in Juneau while on a cruise, though it is believed to <br>
be missing. I wound up wishing I had brought more boxes because we <br>
found a couple of nice parks within walking distance of the dock in a <br>
couple of the stops.<br>

That's what I was thinking when I was looking up prices for the ferry<br>
system. I kept thinking I had to be doing something wrong--the<br>
absolute dead cheapest price I could find from Bellingham to anywhere<br>
was $232. To Juneau it was $316! ONE WAY! I couldn't believe it. Just<br>
to walk on and sleep on a deck? A cruise ship directly out of Seattle<br>
would be cheaper round trip, and then you get meals and accommodations<br>
plus a week (or whatever the duration of chosen cruise) to bum around<br>
Alaska. How can they possibly consider the ferry a poor man's cruise?<br>
No thanks, but I'd prefer the cruise.<br>
<br>
My only cruise experience in the past was the Mediterranian and Black<br>
Seas, and it amount to about $100/day. And I had a pretty plush room<br>
and a lot of bizarre sounding food I couldn't dare pronounce without<br>
embarrassing myself with ports of call in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria,<br>
and the Urkraine. It was great! No way I'm paying $300 to sleep on the<br>
deck for the day and a half it takes to get to anywhere interesting.<br>
<br>
Nope, the poor man's cruise is a cruise ship. Perhaps it's more<br>
economical if you're already IN Alaska and want to island hop among<br>
the various ports, but you can be certain if I do ride the ferry, it's<br>
because I purchased a round-trip airline ticket to get me there, then<br>
used the ferry to visit other locals at the time.<br>
<br>
I'm absolutely stunned it costs so friggin' much to ride that ferry<br>
system, though. Are the bathrooms lined with gold or something?<br>
<br>
I was imagining a wild summer of riding the ferry system all the way<br>
out to the Aleutian Islands and back as one pretty cool adventure, but<br>
sheeze, I'd rather save money and book a round-the-world flight. =)<br>

Speaking of round-the-world flights, my friends did just that a year <br>
ago.  They bought the $10,000+ tix that took them from the <br>
US..Central America..South <br>
America..Australia..China..Mongolia..Africa..Europe and back to the <br>
US.  They stayed in youth hostels, camped and cheap hotels <br>
throughout their 1-1/2 year trip.  I attended a German junior <br>
high/high school with Eero (& his siblings).  We went on to the same <br>
college (although I was long gone by the time he got there--he took <br>
a circuitous route to get there) where he met his wife, Rose.  Any <br>
way, if you're into travel blogs or ever considering a round-the-<br>
world trip they posted a neat journal at:<br>
<br>
http://homepage.mac.com/eero_rose/Menu2.html<br>
<br>
They saved up their money for several years to be able to take this <br>
trip.  In fact, they told all their family/friends that instead of <br>
wedding gifts/birthday/Christmas gifts that they were saving for <br>
this trip so that helped them raise the funds to actually do it. It <br>
was pretty fun to keep up with their travels along the way--looking <br>
for tidbits of info if ever we are able to visit the same places <br>
they did.  Too bad they weren't letterboxing along the way, though, <br>
eh? There'd be some pretty interesting boxes out there!<br>

Well, there could be a couple of factors here.  One is that the cruise might cover a lot of <br>
territory--Alaska is a HUGE state, after all.  (If you lay it out on top of the lower 48 states, <br>
it covers 2/3 of the map.)  Another factor would be that tourism is the way a lot of people <br>
make their money up there, so it's the old hit 'em when you can get 'em thing.  The third <br>
thing, of course, is the lack of competition.<br>
