OK, I posted my idea, drawn out by Pupp. You have to click on the <br/>
image to see the whole thing, and I'm not happy with the lettering, <br/>
which I added after she drew the rest.. but it's there.<br/>
<br/>
And you can get patches bigger than 2 inches in diameter. The patches <br/>
we get at school are 3.5 - 4 inches in diameter.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I really love the idea of using a Northwest native style design. It<br/>
definitely identifies the region and isn't as literal as a map. The<br/>
lettering can easily be altered along the way. In fact, I really like<br/>
the lettering ARose created long ago for the PNW Traveling Event Stamp<br/>
Letterbox. Maybe something like it could be worked in. I've posted it<br/>
to the patch album. <br/>
<br/>
I know we can get patches made in any size. I was just thinking it<br/>
would be nice to make ours similar in size to those from the other<br/>
regions. I have found out that the other round ones are all 2.5 inches<br/>
not 2. That size is also fairly reasonable in price, around $2,<br/>
depending on how much of the patch is embroidered. The patch also can<br/>
be other shapes than round. Adding the heighth and width and then<br/>
dividing by two gives the size.<br/>

But seriously, I like the native American salmon concept -- I also was <br/>
thinking that a native American motif would be cool, and I also thought of <br/>
salmon jumping, so it's neat to see that others are thinking along the same <br/>
lines!<br/>

I like Thunderbirds patch idea but could see<br/>
incorporating the native american fish into it instead<br/>
of the orca, which doesn't seem to fit when I think of<br/>
letterboxing.  Then again, neither does the native<br/>
american fish/salmon but it is definitely indicative<br/>
of the PacNW.  I really think the rain drop is awesome<br/>
as well - only I prefer the raindrop facing as<br/>
raindrops do instead of the evaporation raindrop on<br/>
it's way up.<br/>
