                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went to PCC Rock Creek and found only #1 and #3. #1's log was <br>
removed for drying in March 2003. #2 is truely missing!  The remains <br>
were chewed thru and nothing to be reached within. #3 was in fine <br>
shape. Anyone found #4 recently?  We may have been way off but we <br>
know we were on the right path - Does one have to blaze their own <br>
trail or is there now a very nice swimming pool on top of the cellar?<br>
<br>
We then headed to the boxes at Bethany Lake. Only 1 remains - per the <br>
series owner.  #1 was retired, we got #2 where there was a note left <br>
explaining that #3 and #4 are now gone also. <br>
<br>
3 out of 8 not so good.  <br>
<br>
We moved on to the Rock Creek Park and found the Troll stamp quite <br>
damp and dried it off.  No one had been here since March of 2002!  We <br>
were again disapointed to see notes that the Dragon was missing and <br>
went to see for ourselves.  It looked like some locals had used the <br>
branches to make a hideout in the suspected area where the clue took <br>
us.<br>
<br>
We decided to call it a day ending with a depressing 4 out of 10.  We <br>
would appreciate any insite on any of the above to ease our misery.<br>

My apologies. The log is dried (still a bit fragrant) and in my<br>
letterboxing backpack. I just haven't gotten back there to put it in<br>
the box. We only found two of the four there. I never felt as though I<br>
was sure about being in the right place for numero quatro but tried twice.<br>

I wouldn't despair. Four in one day and a bit of fresh air ain't<br>
nothin' to cry about. We aren't in Connecticut, after all. Funhog<br>
