This afternoon Don and Gwen's well traveled Hitch Hiker, Honor Liberty found it's <br>
latest temporary home in Portland. It is residing quiety in the vacant home of Tribute. <br>
Although the box by Wingnut appears to be MIA, I could think of no more appropriate <br>
place to leave this HH. A gentle sweep of loose dirt will reveal the box.<br>
<br>
For those who are not familiar with Honor Liberty, it is meant to be moved as quickly <br>
as possible. To facilitate this, Don and Gwen have requested that it's hiding places be <br>
posted on the chat lists. It is currently beginning it's third year of travels. <br>
<br>
Since Tribute is missing, I was unable to stamp its image into the HH logbook. If the <br>
person who picks up this hitcher has a copy of the stamp, it would be wonderful if <br>
they scanned the image and pasted it into the book. If you need a copy, I can make a <br>
scan at my end and email it to you. Wingnut could probably do the same. Pick up this <br>
touching stamp! Funhog<br>

Sad sad day indeed, Just returned from "tribute" and it is MIA.  I <br>
plan to recarve this box and re-locate it hopefully this weekend!  As <br>
of now, Said HH is in my possession, and I will be re-locating it <br>
very soon also!   :)  Wingnut<br>

Has anyone seen this HHer? September 11 is getting close and it is <br>
time for her to return to Kernville, Ca. The last posted report on the <br>
HH data base is Jan 13,2005 by Wingnut and I'm quite sure she has been <br>
to many other letterboxes, but not recorded or posted. If you know her <br>
location please contact me off list.<br>

It is directly next to Yellow Rose, if you find it, you'll find Honor<br>
Liberty! <br>

Thank you Don and Gwen.<br>
