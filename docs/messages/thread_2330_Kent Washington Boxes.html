took a look at the boxes in the area and was overwhelmed with the amount.<br/>
She wondered if anyone had any comments to help par down the list? Any must<br/>
do's? Any you know are missing? Any that wouldn't be good to do in January?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!<br/>

We recently looked for many of the Kent area letterboxes and they're <br/>
all great!  Not sure of any missing--all the ones we looked for, we <br/>
found with little/no difficulty.  Recommend she locate a good map of <br/>
the area and study it well before coming because traffic &amp; <br/>
navigating the area for the first time can be a bear.  If she's <br/>
looking for boxes mid-week, try to avoid I-5, Hwy 18 or Hwy 167 <br/>
during rush hour time (7-10am and 3-7pm) as it can be AWFUL!!!  <br/>
Also, since she's coming from the East Coast there isn't much <br/>
daylight around here after 4:30pm--if she can plan her outings for <br/>
early morning to early afternoon that would give her great 'natural' <br/>
lighting--otherwise, she should bring a flashlight.  She may want to <br/>
look into the area Parks &amp; Rec websites for maps to the various <br/>
parks before coming (print them up, too!)--some of the surface <br/>
streets can be a bit confusing. Oh, definitely wrap her clues in <br/>
ziplock bags, bring a raincoat/parka and/or umbrella to ensure she <br/>
has a dry place to stamp in.  You never know this time of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, this will help.  As for narrowing down boxes--she should <br/>
try to focus on topics in which she's interested or whatever types <br/>
of venues she's looking for.  Some are along waterways, others in <br/>
neighborhood parks.  If she wants flora/fauna, she should look for <br/>
the 'longer' outing ones to increase her opportunities to view the <br/>
local wildlife.<br/>
