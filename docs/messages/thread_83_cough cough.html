Bravo the two of you.  It was a perfectly wonderful day.  Warm and <br/>
balmy.  The woods alive with birds, including Common Yellowthroat <br/>
warblers just in from the south.<br/>

The "Fish" box is a classic Trail and Error box and the minute I saw <br/>

I feel mighty pleased over that.<br/>

Your post made me smile, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.<br/>
I wonder who's changing?<br/>
I hadn't realized I had made the mistake on the original message until you mentioned it. I was sure I said ring-neck. Classic case of machines taking over - the computer did it, YEAH THAT'S IT, the computer did it!<br/>
