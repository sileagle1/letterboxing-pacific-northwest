I like the idea of carrying extra ziplocks, not just for when a bag <br/>

LB's that I find?<br/>

I have been guilty of being so excited about opening up a LB that I <br/>
don't pay attention to how it was constructed.  I have sometimes <br/>
found an extra bag after I put it together and realized that I <br/>
needed to double bag the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Would LB placers please tell me if you would be okay with me <br/>
doublebagging your log (when it is not) and marking on the bags what <br/>
they are for?  I would love to do this but only with a general <br/>
consensus of "yes".<br/>

Thanks so much!<br/>

I personally would appreciate anyone taking time to care for any of my boxes. <br/>
Whether it be double bagging or replacing torn bags. Drop a note to the <br/>
placer and let them know the care you've taken...it'll be appreciated!<br/>

I personally carry with me extra baggies of all sizes to replace torn <br/>
or missing baggies and I also label my own baggies as "log book <br/>
baggie" or "stamp baggie". Whenever I do repairs to someone elses <br/>
letterbox on the trail I always leave my "TLC" stamp in their logbook <br/>
so they know someone is looking out for their box.<br/>
