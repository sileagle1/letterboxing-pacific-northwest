                    <div class="plaintext-content">The recent posts of double bagging have really raised my awareness <br>
as I am setting up my first letterbox to be placed.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of carrying extra ziplocks, not just for when a bag <br>
is broken in a LB but to maybe include a second bag for the logbook, <br>
especially in the soggy Northwest.<br>
<br>
My question:  Would LB placers be offended if I took along a sharpie <br>
and marked "Stamp bag" and "Logbook bag #1" and "Logbook bag #2" on <br>
LB's that I find?<br>
<br>
I have been guilty of being so excited about opening up a LB that I <br>
don't pay attention to how it was constructed.  I have sometimes <br>
found an extra bag after I put it together and realized that I <br>
needed to double bag the logbook.<br>
<br>
Would LB placers please tell me if you would be okay with me <br>
doublebagging your log (when it is not) and marking on the bags what <br>
they are for?  I would love to do this but only with a general <br>
consensus of "yes".<br>
<br>
Thanks so much!<br>

I personally would appreciate anyone taking time to care for any of my boxes. <br>
Whether it be double bagging or replacing torn bags. Drop a note to the <br>
placer and let them know the care you've taken...it'll be appreciated!<br>

I personally carry with me extra baggies of all sizes to replace torn <br>
or missing baggies and I also label my own baggies as "log book <br>
baggie" or "stamp baggie". Whenever I do repairs to someone elses <br>
letterbox on the trail I always leave my "TLC" stamp in their logbook <br>
so they know someone is looking out for their box.<br>
