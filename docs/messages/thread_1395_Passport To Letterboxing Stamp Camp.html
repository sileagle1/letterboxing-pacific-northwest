while you parents are attending your workshops.<br/>
There will be a passport given to everyone who attends so that you <br/>
may collect your event stamps,(and there will be a stamp for every <br/>
activity) plus a bonus stamp for collecting them all! There will even <br/>
be some surprise events that will be going on in the evenings and <br/>
some awesome raffle prizes drawn at each workshop as well as plenty <br/>
of letterboxes to find around the park and in the surrounding areas <br/>
of Battle Ground and Yacolt.<br/>
If you have any questions about this event or have made your <br/>
reservations please email Camp Fire Lady at tinarie at msn dot com so <br/>
that we can map out where everyone is located in the camp ground and <br/>

Where: Battle Ground Lake State Park, Battle Ground, WA.<br/>
<br/>
   Come out and spend a weekend camping or come for the day on <br/>
Saturday. There will be workshops on Letterboxing 101, Stamp Carving, <br/>
Book Binding, Jr. Ranger Program and Camp Crafts for the kids as well <br/>
as 18 letterboxes in the area to find! Visit http://www.parks.wa.gov <br/>

that the park has to offer while you are there. <br/>
   Each person attending will be given a Passport that will include <br/>
pages for your personal stamp and information, a map of the park, <br/>
maps to surrounding areas that have letterboxes, clues to letterboxes <br/>
in Battle Ground Lake Park only (you will need to bring the clues for <br/>
letterboxes at Lewisville Park and Yacolt if you plan on searching <br/>
for them while at the Stamp Camp), a complete schedule of events and <br/>
pages for the images of the MANY event stamps and letterboxes that <br/>
you will find at the park. This passport will also make a great <br/>
keepsake after the event.<br/>
   There will be some awesome letterbox items raffled off at the <br/>
event. Raffle tickets are $1.00 each or 6 for $5.00. Kid's raffle <br/>
will be free.<br/>
   When you arrive, everyone including the kids will need to "check <br/>
in" at the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp check in table located <br/>
at campsite # 14 to receive your passport and information about the <br/>
event. <br/>
   Please bring your carving tools if you have them, Starter Kits <br/>
will be available for $5.00 each if you would like to purchase them <br/>
at the event, a hitch hiker if you would like to participate in the <br/>
Hitch Hiker Hostel hidden in the park, your own firewood if you will <br/>
be camping (the park does not provide firewood), your own meals since <br/>
this will not be a potluck event, your letterboxing supplies and <br/>
plenty of cash for the raffles and the day use fee of $5.00 if you <br/>
are not camping out. Please do not bring extra letterboxes or hitch <br/>
hikers to leave on the tables. <br/>
   Your hosts for this event will be Camp Fire Lady, Iron Bear and <br/>
Pandora, Maiden and Bookworm.<br/>
   Look for the red, blue and green balloons that will direct into <br/>
the park from the I-5 freeway and we will see you there at the <br/>
Passport To Letterboxing Stamp Camp at Battle Ground Lake State Park, <br/>
Battle Ground, WA.<br/>
Please R.S.V.P. to Camp Fire Lady at tinarie at msn dot com if you <br/>

I am very excited! This event promises to be spectacular! Just a few <br/>
reminders:<br/>
If you are coming up for the day on Saturday, the park opens at <br/>
6:30am and you can check in at the check-in table located at campsite <br/>
#14 anytime between 6:30am and 9:30 am to make it in time for the <br/>
first workshop at 10:00am.<br/>
Please bring your own food for the day since this will not be a <br/>
potluck event.<br/>
There is a $5.00 day use fee and you will need to park in the parking <br/>
lot just past the entrance and walk to campsite #14. It is not far at <br/>
all.<br/>
There will be raffles throughout the day for some awesome <br/>
letterboxing items and tickets will cost $1.00 each or 6 for $5.00. <br/>
The kid's raffle tickets are free.<br/>
There will also be on hand starter kits with all the items you will <br/>
need to make a letterbox including a carving tool for the stamp <br/>
carving workshop that you can purchase for $5.00 each.<br/>
Donations will be graciously accepted to help offset the cost of the <br/>
event.<br/>
There will be red signs with red, blue and green balloons that will <br/>
direct you to the park from the I-5 freeway. Please watch for them <br/>
and take note of the directions from the post below since there is <br/>
construction in the area.<br/>
Please, and very important, RSVP to tinarie at msn dot com if you <br/>
plan on attending so that we may have enough supplies for everyone.<br/>

see you there!<br/>
