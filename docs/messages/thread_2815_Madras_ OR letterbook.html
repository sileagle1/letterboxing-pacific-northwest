Ahern, AKA Jade Heron, rules! She works at the Jefferson County<br>
libraries in the youth programs and has created a wonderful letterbook<br>
hidden (in plain sight) in the Madras library. <br>
<br>
The clue is clever and encourages kids to read and to learn to use the<br>
catalogue system. It's a fun find for adults too. Her original stamp<br>
was machine made but with a little prodding, she made a nice hand<br>
carved one to put in its place. I guaranteed her that she would have<br>
visitors from far and wide. Make me honest... visit this letterbox,<br>
named Get a Clue. Funhog<br>

Count me in - I'll be after this one next trip over.  Our house is for<br>
sale, so I hope that is soon, although it doesn't look too good at<br>
this point!  We've lowered our price to our absolute rock bottom and<br>
hope to get something going in terms of a sale soon.  There are some<br>
absolutely fantastic deals to be had in Redmond, which is where we are<br>
going.  They are just a teeny bit over-stocked right now, putting it<br>
mildly, lucky for us.  Anyway, I have a great affinity for libraries,<br>
my daughter in the process of getting her masters in library science,<br>
so I will definitely go after this one first chance I get.  <br>
