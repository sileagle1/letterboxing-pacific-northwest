July 1 - 4, 2005 Silver Falls State Park<br/>
<br/>
This is a reminder that the Silver Falls gathering will soon take <br/>
place at Silver Falls State Park near Silverton, Oregon. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Logistics:<br/>
<br/>
Friday and Saturday nights we have group camp sites A and C reserved <br/>
under "Costley"<br/>
Additionally, on Sunday night we have group camp site C reserved <br/>
under "?" (Funhog - can you let us know the name for Sunday night?)<br/>
<br/>
The reservations are from 4:00pm Friday to 1:00pm Sunday (site A) or <br/>
Monday (site C)<br/>
<br/>
The group camp sites are paid for, we will get courtesy day use <br/>
passes for those in the group camp. If you are coming just for the <br/>
day, you'll need to get a day use pass for $3.00 (per car).<br/>
<br/>
Note: Each group site can take 25 campers and 20 cars. As of now, <br/>
the spots are spoken for (and even a little beyond) so we can't take <br/>
any additional campers in the group camp. The files section has a <br/>
list of folks who have indicated when they want to camp <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW/files/). I believe the regular <br/>
sites are full too. You can always come for the day.<br/>
<br/>
Please try to pick the camp site wisely - If you are staying Fri and <br/>
Sat but not Sun it probably makes sense to go to site A to minimize <br/>
the chance someone will have to move their tent from one site to <br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
Schedule:<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
Friday: <br/>
<br/>
4:00PM - earliest check in<br/>
7:00PM - Exchange and socializing *<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday: <br/>
<br/>
6:00AM - Rise and Shine ***<br/>
6:00PM - Potluck dinner/exchange * **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sunday: <br/>
<br/>
6:15AM - Rise and Shine (you get to sleep in since it is Sunday) ***<br/>
Noon - BYO lunch/exchange *<br/>
1:00PM - Campsite A must be cleared<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Monday:<br/>
<br/>
6:00AM - Rise and Shine ***<br/>
1:00PM - Campsite A must be cleared<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* We'll try to set up for the potluck and exchanges at site C since <br/>
that one is reserved the whole time. I request that hitchhikers and <br/>
other boxes are kept away from the exchange (exception only for the <br/>
official event stamp). With 50 people it can get quite hectic even <br/>
without extra boxes and hitchhikers going around. Logs and stamps <br/>
have a tendancy to separate in the chaos. You are welcome to pass <br/>
off hitchhikers in the normal manor via the boxes in the park. <br/>
Special event only boxes are welcome but please try to clue them <br/>
even if they are kept somewhere in the camping vicinity.<br/>
<br/>
** I think potluck is pretty self explanatory. It would be a <br/>
logistical nightmare to try to organize a variety of dishes so I'm <br/>
not even going to try to do so. If we all wind up bringing a box of <br/>
Krispy Kreme doughnuts, we'll have to make do. I will make sure <br/>
there are plates/utensils/napkins. You are on your own for drinks.<br/>
<br/>
*** That's a joke folks.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hiding boxes: <br/>
<br/>
If you are hiding boxes please do not hide them on the Canyon Trail -<br/>
there are already boxes on that trail and the State Park has <br/>
requested we use the other trails. The Canyon trail is by far the <br/>
most popular trail; the other trails get limited use and thus are <br/>
better suited for stealthy hiding and finding of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
There is a file in the files section <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW/files/) that highlights which <br/>
trails the state park folks recommend we use.<br/>
<br/>
Please bring copies of clues for boxes you plant in the park to <br/>
share at the gathering!<br/>
<br/>
Information on the park (including directions) can be found at:<br/>
http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_211.php<br/>
<br/>
See you there!<br/>
