                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well we finally have some hotels booked for our trip to the Portland <br/>
area. We'll be in Troutdale AUG 26-27, Cascade Locks AUG 28-30, Salem <br/>
AUG 31-SEP 1, and somewhere between Gresham &amp; Mount Hood area SEP 2-4.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to meet up with us for an exchange, a hike, or a <br/>
dinner just let us know.  There had been some talk about getting <br/>
together on Saturday SEP 3 with some local boxers, but I haven't<br/>
heard <br/>
anything definite yet.  We don't have a cell phone, so hope to <br/>
finalize any plans before we leave.  (However we can provide our<br/>
hotel <br/>
phone numbers if anyone wants to contact us to attempt a spontaneous <br/>
get-together.  Please contact me off-line.)<br/>

Counting down the days....<br/>

enjoy trying to get the elusive Temple of Terror mystery box that's in<br/>
the Portland area. So far as I know, nobody has ever found that box<br/>
since the week after I planted it in 2001! And it's a wonderful, but<br/>
sadly neglected letterbox. One of my favorites that I've planted, and<br/>
that's saying a lot because I've planted a lot of them! =) It all just<br/>
fell into place so well.<br/>
