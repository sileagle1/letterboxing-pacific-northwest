                    <div class="plaintext-content">Iron`Bear and I went to retrieve the Snicket box today, and ran into <br>
a problem.  We were stamping in early this morning over by the <br>
concrete shelter that the box is hidden at when someone happened <br>
upon us. She said hello, we said hello, and didn't worry much about <br>
it. We waited for them to leave and then re-hid the box and went our <br>
merry little way.  <br>
<br>
There has recently be another box hidden in the same area  so we <br>
went to nab that box as well and we were stamping into that box when <br>
she happened about us again.  Only this time we were a bit more <br>
concerned, so we stuff the box into our bag quickly, and decided to <br>
chit chat with her a bit.  She informed us that we were not supposed <br>
to be at this location, that it was coast guard property. We were a <br>
little concerned also with her actions; there were not very eco-<br>
friendly as she was trampling down anything in her way at this <br>
point.  She also told us that she worked for Cape Disappointment at <br>
the Interpretive Center. But she left again and headed back down the <br>
overgrown road we took to get up there.  So Iron`Bear went to hide <br>
the 2nd letterbox again  and suddenly out of no where she appeared <br>
again, right behind him.  We are uncertain or not if she actually <br>
saw him hiding the box, but for sure she knew we were up to <br>
something back there.  We are worried that since the clues to <br>
Maiden's box Correspond to the Clues to the Snicket Box, that they <br>
both may have ended up compromised.  Both boxes were re-hiding well, <br>
and hind sight 20/20 and after conferring with Ryan Carpenter I wish <br>
I had pulled the boxes to maintain their safety and returned them in <br>
a month after the dust settled, but I was worried about pulling <br>
someone else's letterbox and upsetting them. I didn't really know <br>
what to do though, it was the first time I have ever been in a <br>
situation like this, were I felt that boxes were compromised.  We <br>
did everything we could and waited a long time for her to go away, <br>
but damn that woman just kept showing back up.<br>
<br>
I feel terrible  but I can't get back out there to pull the boxes <br>
which I think is the best thing to do at this point.  I have written <br>
Mr. Snicket and await hearing back from him, but if anyone is close <br>
enough to this area that they can go pull these boxes TODAY  ASAP  <br>
Time is of the essence before perhaps the Park finds them, then <br>
please go do so and contact me to let me know.<br>
<br>
My most sincere apologies to anyone that might miss this box due to <br>
my unfortunate accident,<br>

However, if I did have some, I would think that I would want the letterboxer to take the box with them if they have room if they felt the box could be compromised or placed on property wrongly.  Thanks for caring.  Its nice to know there are such letterboxers out there.<br>
