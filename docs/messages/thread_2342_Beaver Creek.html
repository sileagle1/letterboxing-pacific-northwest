I tried to get it last summer -- part of the trail was in extreme <br>
disrepair and im-passable.  There was even a sign that said "trail <br>
closed".  I don't know if it's accessible from the other side of <br>
Beaver Creek.<br>

Yes, I went there and it looks like it would have been fun! At one time <br>
there was a huge stair way built down the side of this hill. MonkeyBoy <br>
and I went part way down and discovered that about half way down it had <br>
been ripped out or maybe it was getting washed out and too dangerous so <br>
they took it apart. We tried to go down part of it anyway but it was <br>
just way to steep for my bad knee and trying to get a 7yr. old down and <br>
back up! Some of you may be into that but it looks pretty muddy and <br>
treacherous.<br>

Cat's Meow and I also attempted the Beaver Creek box sometime last year <br>
and found the stairway much to hazardous half way down. <br>
We did see someone walking their dog at the bottom and wondered if they <br>
had come down the stairway (not likely) or if there was another way to <br>
the bottom without using the stairway. Hmmmmmmm.<br>
Maybe this calls for a Beaver Creek Conundrum Gathering sometime after <br>
the rains and flooding. Another Hmmmmmm.<br>
