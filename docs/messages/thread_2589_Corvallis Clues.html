Unfortunatly not every link works, but some do. The specific one you<br>

watch out, cause the last time it was archived was March 2005.<br>

I certainly would not mind offering a modest amount in return for all<br>
that LbNA has given to me and the letterboxing community. I miss more<br>
than just being able to access clues listed there and hope a way can<br>
be found to keep it going for a well balanced letterboxing future.  H-A-F<br>
