                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glenn, I had to go back and review my log book.  I remember that box <br>
precisely based on my notes.  Amazing that I could recall it once I <br>
read my book. I didnt remember the stamp as much as the Bald Eagle <br>
that distracted my proper navigation.  Darn birds.<br>
<br>
I remember that long ago  4th of July weekend where I snagged 30+ <br>
boxes including my first Glenn and T&E experience at Pt Defiance.  I <br>
was a Green as Grass newbie and learned a lot from those four daze of <br>
boxing.<br>
<br>
For you new folks, the Pt Defiance boxes are a great weekend or two <br>
of boxing.  A grand venue with some most excellent adventures set up <br>
primarily by Glenn and T&E ( visit their web site linked in Glenns <br>
post for clues).  The best forest you will find in the Puget Lowlands <br>
some of these trees are massive.<br>
<br>
It is an education in cluesmanship.  You will learn all is not as it <br>
seems, that you think outside of the box and that correct spelling is <br>
not as important as paying attention as you go from here and there. <br>
Some are simply simple others, well if they were all easy it would <br>
not be fun.<br>
<br>
Put on your thinking caps.  Enjoy the venue.<br>
