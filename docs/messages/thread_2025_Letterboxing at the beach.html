I went to Brookings, OR yesterday and what a beautiful day! we located <br/>
the "Indian Sands" LB which only had 3 other entries in it. This is an <br/>
awesome stamp!!! get out there and get this one!!!!  Anyways I dragged <br/>
along 3 non-letterboxers and evidently this was "cruel and unusual <br/>
punishment" these wonderful friends of mine are not used to hiking and <br/>
this is a very short one, maybe 1/4 of a mile, but it is a steep trail. <br/>
They were huffin and puffin and hurtin and there I was trekking along <br/>
like a kid after candy hehehe  :) Had a great time, my friends enjoyed <br/>
it once we got back home and I treated them to Caramel Caribou icecream <br/>
and then all in the world was well.  Get out there and get this <br/>
letterbox!!!!!  its an amazing stamp, very detailed and authentic :)<br/>

Hey Erfellie,<br/>
Thanks for the Indian Sands plug.  I am pretty proud of that stamp my <br/>
own self.  I hope you dragged your friends out onto the bluffs.  I <br/>
originally hid the box out there, but it disappeared.  It is one of the <br/>
neatest spots of anywhere I know. Thanks again for the compliment.  You <br/>
made my day!<br/>
