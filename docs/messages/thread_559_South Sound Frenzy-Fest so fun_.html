and I'm so proud of all the stamps in my little book! As a brand <br>
spanking new letterboxer, it was great to see the cool journals for <br>
logbooks, the neat ideas for color on small stamps (Hoopoe I think <br>
had the little dot inkers in a rainbow of color-SOOO much better than <br>
markers swiped from my daughter!) and the great tips from Rayvenhaus <br>
on gluing stamps to wood blocks. <br>
<br>
We'll be all for an event in the fall, and maybe strgzrdaddy can <br>
come,too, if he ever figures out what signature stamp he wants! <br>
<br>
Thanks again for food, tips and fun!<br>
<br>
Cami, Gryphon, Rowan and Leecia-who despite being pooped on by a bird <br>
says she had fun,too!<br>
