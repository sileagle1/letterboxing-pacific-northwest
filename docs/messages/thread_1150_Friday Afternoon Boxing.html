road for some serious letterboxing. We found all four of the boxes at the<br/>
zoo in great shape. Then we headed up the hill to the Hoyt Arboretum.  We<br/>
didn't find the Tres Foil box and fear it's MIA, we did however find<br/>
Tribute.  The kids LOVED the location.  They spent a long time walking on<br/>
the fallen tree.<br/>

We finished off our trip with Little Bunny Foo Foo, (Pandora, if you're<br/>
reading this, the log book is full and the stamp is broken in two pieces).<br/>

Overall we found 6 boxes and the weather and company couldn't have been any<br/>
better!<br/>
