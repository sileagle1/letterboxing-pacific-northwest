A few drive-bys that we know of are Rooster Rock, Cousins, and Horse Heaven<br>
Hills.<br>
We placed a couple of the boxes to break up the long drive.   There's some<br>
pretty nice boxes in the Tri-cities if you have time to stop & hunt.<br>
<br>
Crowgirl, I imagine we'll pass you somewhere on I-5 as we'll be driving<br>
south from Portland to Phoenix for Christmas!<br>
So do you, or anyone else (since this crowd travels so much), have<br>
recommendations for boxes?  We'll have a chance to box in Redding, Oakland,<br>
Santa Barbara, Phoenix (lots of time here),  and depending on weather maybe<br>
Laughlin, NV.<br>
<br>
So Crowgirl . . . do you know Storm Crow?<br>

  Hi!<br>
<br>
  We will be road tripping through from San Jose, CA to Spokane, WA<br>
  (with a minor stop planned in PDX). Wondering if anyone has must-nab<br>
  recommendations (easy freeway access a plus) -- feel free to toot your<br>
  own horn. I-5 to Portland, up thru the tri-cities. Also, anyone<br>
  interested in a mini-meet in Spokane, something along the lines of<br>
  Escape Your In-Laws Lunch? (dec 23? or 27th?)<br>
<br>
  Thanks! Look forward to hopefully meeting some of you!<br>
