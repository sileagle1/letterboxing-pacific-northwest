for a wonderful weekend of letterboxing!<br/>
It was a great experience to meet all the fun and interesting folks <br/>
behind the names.<br/>
The park was beautiful and filled with great letterboxes to find.<br/>
We appreciate how nice everyone was to us not-very-experienced <br/>
letterboxers and our not-always-ruly boys. ;)<br/>
<br/>
In one weekend we went from P1 F35 X0 to P2 F45 X29!<br/>
(plus the event stamp and the hitchhikers or whatever Molly, Oprah, and <br/>
K-Martha count as).<br/>
<br/>
Our 9 year old Patrick "Lucky Charm" carved his very first stamp at the <br/>
carving lesson, and mom DblTall made her first log book at the <br/>
bookbinding class, so to celebrate this momentous occasion we added <br/>
another letterbox to a park already abounding with them. It's called <br/>
"First Time's the Charm" and I will post the clues soon.<br/>
Patrick was absolutely thrilled to plant his very own letterbox, and <br/>
have lots of people stamp in it right away.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed meeting everyone, and had a wonderful time!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all the terrific people who made this possible.<br/>

I am sure that the Stamp Camp event will be a huge success and I, for one, am sorry that we will not be able to attend.  Unless the<br/>
condition of my father changes drastically one way or the other, we are unable to go more than 20 minutes away in any direction to<br/>
letterbox, let alone stay away for an overnighter.<br/>
<br/>
I can't think of anyone better suited to host/plan this event other than you guys and I do so look forward to hearing all the<br/>
wonderful stories that are sure to come out of it.<br/>
