Falls back in August ... I would venture to say from the location and <br/>
the hidding place that they are all still there, but I think if I <br/>
remember correctly a landmark has indeed changed on Horsetail Falls, <br/>
Iron`Bear might remember better than I as he found the letterboxes <br/>
that day and I just followed in his almighty footsteps!!!<br/>
