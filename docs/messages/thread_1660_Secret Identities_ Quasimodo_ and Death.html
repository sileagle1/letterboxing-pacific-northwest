                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Dear Mr. Snicket, how wonderful of you to join us once again on <br>
this group that is so alive.  You are truly one of the greatest.  <br>
Just the sound of your name makes one wonder "who is this masked <br>
man"?  I however am Cherokee and Cherokee have mystical powers.  <br>
When used correctly these powers can help the Cherokee to see a <br>
person through the mask and I must say that you are not "horribily <br>
disfigured".  The great spirits have informed me of your true <br>
identity Mr. DH.  And I understand that children are in awe of you <br>
when you read to them.  In any case I understand why you choose to <br>
remain cloaked.  The spirit of the night has been helping me to <br>
understand.  I do wish you would plant more letterboxes.  Maybe a <br>
Postal or two.  Anyway I bid you well and now that the sprits have <br>
shown me your "other" great works I will be reading them soon.<br>
<br>
Thanks for adding a great element to this wonderful hobby of ours.<br>
<br>

<br>
Why does each volume in your series grow longer than the previous?  <br>
Odd isn't it?  I wonder if your clues will suffer the same <br>
dreadfully, wonderful, yet horrendous fate?  Of course, I use this <br>
thread of words as a form of 'dramatic irony' meaning of course <br>
that...hmmm, now where are those orphans now?  Does Count Olaf, er, <br>
I mean, Stefano, have them under his wing these days???  Oh, why oh <br>
why did Monty have to die??? And why oh why is Mr Poe ALWAYS at the <br>
bank???  Man, he needs a hobby or at least to open his eyes!!!  And <br>
what about Sunny--when will she ever learn how to speak??? Budaloo--<br>
which means she's just as excited about learning to say a word or <br>
two as much as we want her to!<br>
<br>
The agony of it all and that darned viper, to boot!!!  Wonder how <br>
the cruise to Peru will go?<br>
<br>
:D<br>
