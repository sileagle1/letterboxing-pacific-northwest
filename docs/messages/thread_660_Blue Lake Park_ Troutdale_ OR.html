including Ryan and Funhog.  It took us a long time, counting out 38<br/>
paces in almost every direction before we found it.  That was at least a<br/>
year ago, but it seems very unlikely that the box will go missing.  Keep<br/>
trying, you'll find it.<br/>

This is why we sometimes curse Der Mad Stamper!<br/>
This box was a Bear!! And it did take a whole group of us combing the <br/>
ground like a CSI team to find the thing!! :-)<br/>
Keep at it!<br/>
