The date has been set for the Canadian gathering, October 9th, Canadian<br>
Thanksgiving weekend. It will be held at the original site of the Hudson Bay<br>
Fort Langley and near Historic Fort Langley where their annual Cranberry<br>
Festival will also be happening. So there are lots of reason to come on up!<br>
I will be sending out directions, time and other information in the next<br>
week or so, but only to those who respond. So if you can come - let me know<br>
asap! Also, if you have any special ideas or tips to ensure this is a great<br>
event, let me know. Ryan - we will need an event stamp!!!!<br>
Meanwhile - happy hunting<br>

My passport suffered from a freak washing-machine accident, so I'm <br>
not sure how good my credentials are for traveling to Canada.  But <br>
I'm gonna work on getting a birth certificate to ensure I can make it <br>
without any problems.  =)<br>
<br>
Hey, the information I found about traveling to Canada says that you <br>
either need a passport OR proof of citizenship and a photo ID.  I've <br>
got the photo ID, but what else--besides a birth certificate--might <br>
count towards towards 'proof of citizenship'?  A social security <br>
card?  A letter from mom?  A five-spot slipped to the border guards?  <br>

-Stay tuned for a couple new boxes in Northern Cal.<br>
<br>
I'm sending a couple boxes down to Melissa (M.A.P.) to plant. From <br>
what I understand the boxes will be around Humboldt / Del Norte.  If <br>
I recall you were down I-5 from time2time with family in Cal. (??).<br>
<br>
Beyond that I have some maint.to do on the few boxes I have in <br>
Vancouver / Portland and about 8 more that are carved just waiting <br>
for me to strap on a pair of boots and a brain.<br>
<br>
Happy Tuesday,<br>
