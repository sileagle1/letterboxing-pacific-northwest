Ramona Falls is one of the beauties of the Mt. Hood National Forest.  Breathtaking views of Mt. Hood from the Sandy River and beautiful alpine forests and meadows, with a small but glorious creek which is full of many small falls along the way up to Ramona Falls. The walk is long but easy and beautiful.  It is also very popular for hiking and horse riding and backpacking.  There is a very lovely camping area up beside the falls.   This is a seasonal hike, since they remove the bridge in the fall and replace it after the heavy melt, around Memorial Day. <br>
 <br>
We have placed a box, Ramona Clifts,  as part of a future series, and will post the clues when finalized.  Lots of room for boxing up there!<br>
