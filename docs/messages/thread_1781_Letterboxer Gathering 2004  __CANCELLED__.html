Rats! Keep up seeding your letterboxing garden and it will surely grow. Perhaps we <br>
will meet on one of your future visits to the big ol' scary city. Funhog<br>

Hey, I'm sorry to hear this was cancelled.  Unfortunately, December <br>
is just not a very good month for us to travel so far for a get <br>
together (work, school, family/personal commitments-wise).  If you <br>
plan something in the Spring or Summer sort of around a long weekend <br>
(and in our particular case never the first weekend of a month--<br>
unless it's a holiday) then we'd more likely be able to attend.  <br>
Believe me, nobody has to twist MY arm to travel to your part of the <br>
Pacific Northwest--EVER!!!  I love it down there!!!  If we were able <br>
to attend such an event, we'd actually make a 'camping trip' out of <br>
it and try to spend at least a couple of days to a week in the area <br>
(to justify the transportation costs just to get us there).<br>
<br>
Hopefully, we can get something going down there at a future time?  <br>
The crazy part is--our schedule is sort of set in marshmallow until <br>
abbut 3 weeks out--so it's very difficult to commit to something so <br>
far down the calendar (thank the nature of my job for that!).  :(  <br>
Happy letterboxing!<br>
