Here's a report on the other letterboxes that we were able to find, on our <br>
own and on forays with a few other PNW boxers. I don't think that we <br>
discovered any that were missing (other than the Lycan Transformation boxes <br>
which have already been noted as having problems with the clues). Along the <br>
way, I also hit F600; and we ended our trip being soothed by the sultry <br>
voice of a certain letterboxer on our plane's speakers as we headed back to <br>
Philly from Seattle....<br>

<br>
How in the heck did you guys find #2?<br>
And how in the heck did you not find #1?<br>
<br>
The problems with the clues should not have stopped you from finding #1 at<br>
all... they should have caused you problems on 2.. And made the rest<br>
impossible. But for the life of me I can't figure out how you missed the one<br>
with good clues and got the one with bad clues :)<br>

Ryan posted a summary of our attempt; we knew that there were problems with <br>
some of the clues, but we didn't know which ones were affected, so we <br>
didn't agonize too much over them. But I led us astray at #1 and we just <br>
never found the nurse tree or the tree "taller than the rest" after <br>
crossing the road and being confused about which path was light and which <br>
was dark. Then Amanda picked up the path and led us to the general area of <br>
#2. There, the group paused when we couldn't pick up the next part of the <br>
clue, and while the rest of the gang regrouped, I forged ahead a bit <br>
farther and found the "redder tree" and the box just as Amanda exclaimed <br>
that we weren't going to find any of the boxes (one of those classic, <br>
perfectly-timed moments). We then followed the path without problem until <br>
we reached the bench at #3, but we couldn't find that box and our time ran <br>
out and we had to head back.<br>
<br>
Still, it was a terrifically fun day, and we had worked up quite an <br>
appetite by the time we sat down to margaritas and Mexican food back in <br>
Centralia.<br>
<br>
