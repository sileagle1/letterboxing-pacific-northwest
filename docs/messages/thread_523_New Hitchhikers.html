don't care what happens to them. <br/>
<br/>
Of the five I place early on in my Lb days I have only heard about the<br/>
travels of one and that was about a year ago. I had hoped to follow<br/>
their travels as they circled the globe. No such luck! So, I just<br/>
decided they were a waste of my time and creative energy. <br/>
<br/>
I do, however, try to make a report to the originator whenever I do<br/>
happen to find one. Funhog<br/>
