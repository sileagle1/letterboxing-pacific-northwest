                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good morning fellow Letterboxers of the Pacific Northwest,<br>
<br>
My trail handle is Keegan the Airedale Terrier - quite a mouthful, no? It's<br>
taken from my one year old Airedale, Keegan. He's named after Manchester<br>
City's soccer coach, Kevin Keegan.<br>
<br>
Keegan and I headed to Seatac, Washington. We were seeking the Flight Path<br>
Letterbox series located in Des Moines Creek Park. It was a beautiful<br>
spring day in the Pacific Northwest: blue skies, puffy white clouds, trees<br>
and flowers in bloom and a gentle breeze to keep one cool.<br>
<br>
Before we started working on the clues for the boxes, I took Keegan down a<br>
side trail where I could let him off the lease for a while. I ran ahead,<br>
thinking he would follow. A bit further down the trail, I noticed no Keegan<br>
in sight. I turned back and eventually found the Keegs. He was rolling in a<br>
big pile of poop!<br>
<br>
I have owned several dogs down the years and so have had to handle this<br>
doggy joy before. It was his first time rolling, and WILL NOT be his<br>
last... Thankfully, we were right next to the creek and I was able to get<br>
most of the poo off. But the smell, well you know. Windows down for the<br>
ride home.<br>
<br>
It made for an interesting day of letterboxing. Fortunately, no on asked to<br>
pet him. Good thing, eh?<br>
<br>
I was able to find 4 of the 6 boxes hidden by Amanda from Seattle. A quite<br>
nice series located near Seatac airport. If anyone is flying into or out of<br>
Seatac, and wants to letterbox nearby, here's a good series.<br>
<br>
Hope your day on the trail went better.<br>
Keegan the Airedale Terrier, who's smelling much better after a bath!<br>

Danny<br>

PS<br>
<br>
Does anyone else have a misadventure or two letterboxing they'd care to share?<br>

scout troop's geocaching and letterboxing adventure at<br>

 Mr. Beat and I have three dogs, but never have taken<br>
them with us....for this very reason, afraid of what<br>
messes they can make or get in to.  My hat is off to<br>
you Danny/Keegan.  Thanks for the great laugh!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We almost always have at least one dog with us when we go boxing. In <br>
fact pretty quick here we'll have three at a time. I see it as a win-<br>
win situation. I get to box and the dog(s) get walked! I also find <br>
that many of the boxes we hunt are on trails. So it gives me the <br>
perfect opportunity to work on the "heel" command and of course <br>
the "sit/stay" command once we find the box. But I will say that that <br>
command doesn't neccessarily get obeyed when we first get to the box <br>
since us humans are so excited by finding it the dogs get excited <br>
too!  I think I"m going to take some dog treats with and when we find <br>
boxes the dogs get a treat too! <br>
<br>
Til later,<br>
