these boxes. Thanks to some emails I was aware that some log books <br/>
were soggy. So I replaced two books and up dated the clues to try and <br/>
account for some of the new growth on the trail. And assist all those <br/>
who have tried but failed to find box 4. <br/>
<br/>
All the boxes were there, Alive and well. Letterboxing is too fun <br/>
when you think about it. Those boxes have been hiding in the park for <br/>
two years...Crazy. Maiden1974 found her 100th box in the "Produce <br/>
Row". Congrats. <br/>
<br/>
Now I added a bonus box to the series "Whisky Jack" so feel free to <br/>
check the clues again and pickup the extra box. (clues are moderate <br/>
but the box is a quick grab if you have already hit the series).<br/>
