<br>
As Iron`Bear and I leave this morning for the Stamp Camp event I <br>
thought I would pop in and say hello and let you all know that we <br>
both look forward to meeting all of you that are attending and <br>
encourage all of you that can to come on down for Saturday and join <br>
us for a wonderful event and my Birthday :)<br>
<br>
For those of you coming I also wanted to remind you that you might <br>
want to remember to ask me for a little bit of chaos to receive my <br>
personal traveler and if you are able to tell me what my favorite <br>
movie length animated cartoon featuring a Mystic Creature was when I <br>
was a kid you can also receive my brand spanking new personal <br>
traveler.<br>
<br>
Hope to meet to faces and see some familiar ones this weekend.<br>
<br>
I bid you all well,<br>
Pandora<br>
