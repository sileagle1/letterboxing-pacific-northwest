                    <div class="plaintext-content">We started letterboxing in June after reading an article in a family <br>
magazine.We didn't find the first one but were hooked after finding <br>
the second one. Now 22 boxes later we are loving this new sport as a <br>
family. We started out with a store bought stamp but now we carved <br>
our own to represent our family. Our first was in Long beach, WA the <br>
kite letterbox and then some at the oregon coast, but most in the <br>
gorge and Mt. Hood area. We also found our first hitchhiker which was <br>
hitchbiker dude. That was exciting.We try to chose areas that are <br>
good for our 3 small kids and I am 8 months pregnant. Thank you to <br>
those that place boxes in those places. The most difficult box for us <br>
was at Cape Meares which was a mile hike down to the beach and we <br>
couldn't find the box and had to hike up empty handed. We are finding <br>
that happens sometimes. We have learned of this site and have been <br>
able to identify usually first if the box is missing or not. We were <br>
going to go look for the blue lake park one but decided not to when <br>
we read it was missing. Thank you to those for the dedication you put <br>
into places boxes. We hope to some day place some boxes but maybe <br>
when the kids are a little older.Any advice to new people would be <br>
great. Sorry it got so long we just wanted to introduce ourselves and <br>
look forward to getting to know fellow letterboxers. We feel like we <br>
already know some of you by just finding your stamps that you have <br>
carved and placed.Again thanks.<br>
