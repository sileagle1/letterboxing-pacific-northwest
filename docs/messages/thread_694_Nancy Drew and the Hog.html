                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned from a three day jaunt over Mt. Hood to Central Oregon. The  <br>
original plan was to pitch a tent at Trillium Lake and enjoy the lovely late summer <br>
weather. However, the rain deities changed our minds. We DID stroll in the mist and <br>
find all six of the lovely little stamps that ring the lake. We also replaced the film <br>
canister for the one that needed it and then proceeded on to the sunny side of the <br>
state. <br>
 <br>
We stopped outside of Warm Springs and Amanda from Seattle got firsties at <br>
Waterfowl Highway. It is a total mystery to me why no other letterboxers have found <br>
this one before, being right off highway 26 and a short stroll. During the next two <br>
days, we visited a slug o' boxes: the Cove, Crooked River Bridge, Crooked River Ranch <br>
#1 & #4, Eagle Crest, Cline Falls, Sam Johnson Park, and both north and south <br>
Redmond Dry Canyon letterboxes. All were just dandy.<br>
<br>
After having the only boxes in the area for nearly a year and a half, it's totally exciting <br>
to see the new goodies appearing in the area. It's on its way to becoming an official <br>
letterboxing destination! Many thanks to Birder, Cyndie, Lennens 3, the Fleshmans <br>
and 7Nails for upping the count in this part of the state. Just for good luck, we hid <br>
two new boxes along the way. Clues will follow directly (although they themselves <br>
may not be particularly direct.) Funhog<br>
