It looked like Wild Woman and Wild Child signed in 4-5 times her stamp ink went thru several pages.  Not sure we can help the log.  We will put out a replacement as we are able.<br/>
<br/>
Burntwood Park, Cooper Park, and Hiteon Park boxes are all alive and well.   Really love the 6 trees!  Isn't nature wonderful !!!!!  Great placement, but there were kids catching tadpoles so it was tricky getting the box back to it's hidey hole.<br/>
<br/>
Of course we had Molly with us so it was abit tricky for her to log in at Burntwood.  I love the log and stamp by A. Rose,  great little log and very nice stamp! <br/>

Wingnut and I found Hiteon park about a month ago, and it really was <br/>
cool to see the trees.  We love to read the clues and then go and as <br/>
we are looking it becomes very obvious as the 6 trees out of one <br/>
did!!!!!  Very cool!!!!  Glad to hear Cooper Park is alive and well <br/>
too, there were some problems with this one, but guess it is all ok <br/>
now!!!!!!<br/>
