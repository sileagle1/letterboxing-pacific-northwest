morning on the 4th and 5th, as a nice beginning to my day before the pulp <br>

early or stay late by a day or two.  I don't know which yet.  It depends on <br>
my friend, who needs housesitting/care for her pooches at the end of May. <br>
It would be actually nice to come early, since I'm a little worried that <br>
Oxbow is first come, first served camping, and I want to be sure I get a <br>

If y'all are gathering, I would sure love to come and meet you all.<br>
