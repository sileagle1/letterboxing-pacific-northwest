                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now here's a topic ripe for discussion: How close to another letterbox should a new <br/>
box be placed?<br/>
<br/>
In a recent email, a finder of my Oaks Bottom box discovered another letterbox <br/>
literally on top of mine. In fact, he nearly missed mine because it was shoved so deep. <br/>
I know that there are no rules regarding such placing but I find it annoying. I take a <br/>
lot of time ferreting out good spots. This hidey hole is not big enough for two boxes <br/>
to be well hidden. <br/>
<br/>
I have hidden boxes in the same park, on the same mountain or on the same trail as <br/>
other boxes but never anywhere near them. When I make a series, I try to have the <br/>
boxes at least a ten minute walk apart. That way there is less potential for <br/>
environmental damage and the development of social trails. Those social trails are <br/>
the very thing that gets geocaches removed from parks and I don't want that to be <br/>
the case with my letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
When boxes are really close together, it also requires that you hang around an area <br/>
much longer stamping in. This would seem to lead to a greater chance of discovery <br/>
by and onlooker and the possible loss of letterboxes. I also like to have time between <br/>
boxes to warm up a bit if I'm hiking in the winter. <br/>
<br/>
These are a few of my thoughts... anyone else??? Funhog<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Incidentally, anyone know who owns that box on top of mine at Oaks Bottom? <br/>
apparently there is no clue to it and no contact info inside... <br/>

As a rule of thumb, I agree with you. Of course there are <br/>
exceptions, I can think of one which I won't reveal because it is <br/>
clever enough that I plan to eventually use it. In any case I would <br/>
say don't do it without a good reason. If it is just because it is a <br/>
convenient location, work a little harder.<br/>

I don't think it could possibly have been a HH. It was about 12 inches by 10<br/>

<br/>
I try not to place my boxes to close to others. I did it in one case only<br/>
because it was in the area I wanted and it was secluded enough I didnt' feel<br/>
it would impact the area. I had one other box end up close to another one<br/>
not knowing there was another one in the area.<br/>

Generally I don't like boxes that are less than 10 minutes between boxes.<br/>
But that's just me.<br/>

- Iron`Bear and I have been doing a lot of boxing lately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I too happened across the Oaks Bottom box with the "Big Y" box planted<br/>
practically on top of it - and I also do not think there is any possible way<br/>
that it could have been a hitch hiker - it was simply too large, and it<br/>
contained an ink pad and a pen - not something you typically see in a hitch<br/>
hiker.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also throwing my two cents in - and I realize that's not worth more than two<br/>
pennies - so take it for what it's worth. I welcome many things in my boxes,<br/>
hitch hikers, coo coo clues. (I was so excited to see Miller and Hutch had<br/>
left their clues in one of my boxes).  However I would prefer boxes were not<br/>
planted either on top of mine or too close to mine.  I value discretion when<br/>
finding my boxes, often times when I find a letterbox I will even walk away<br/>
from the location I found it in and stamp in else where to avoid being seen<br/>
near the location. (Unless the trail is simply not often traveled.) I would<br/>
hope that many people would do the same thing with my boxes.  And personally<br/>
I really would not want another box within 30-40 feet of mine.  I understand<br/>
that sometimes people plant boxes without realizing there is another box<br/>
there, but I think some extra time researching your location when planting<br/>
would help alleviate that. I know that I go to extra effort to make sure I<br/>
don't use the same name for a letterbox that someone else locally has<br/>
already used, and I definitely don't plant boxes in the same exact area.  I<br/>
recently planted a series up at the Audubon Sanctuary very near Funhog's<br/>
"What's For Dinner", But I did it at the recommendation of Funhog herself<br/>
when I had told her that I didn't have a home for this wonderful new<br/>
hummingbird series I had. In addition to getting her permission we took very<br/>
careful measure to make sure we were far enough away from any of her boxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the other thing to keep in mind as a letter boxer is that often<br/>
times we all plant things in places that are very special to us for one<br/>
reason or another, My Love Shack Wedding Memorial box for example, was<br/>
planted in the first Park Iron`Bear and I ever went to together.  While<br/>
there were other boxes planted there, I was careful to go in a different<br/>
direction from them entirely.  If we keep in mind that perhaps the places<br/>
other letter boxers are taking us to are very special and endearing to them,<br/>
we might understand why they would get upset about something like the<br/>
environment being trampled on around their boxes, or another letterbox being<br/>
too nearby.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion if you know that there is another letterbox near by, or even<br/>
on the same trail for that matter a common courtesy to the placer might be<br/>
to contact them via email first and ask them if they mind if you plant one<br/>
in a nearby location.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I understand totally that everyone has as much a right to plant a box as I<br/>
do, anywhere they want, but I personally think that we all try to be<br/>
respectful of each other's feelings and of each other's boxes, and I think<br/>
that is what makes this pacific northwest group such a wonderful group of<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I was in California I ran into a situation where someone used my<br/>
letterbox as a clue for theirs.  I have seen lots of people put at the end<br/>
of their clues things like "While in the area you might want to check out<br/>
pandora's Turtle Soup Letterbox" and I think that is wonderful, let people<br/>
know if something else is within their range, but I didn't appreciate my<br/>
letterbox being used as a starting point without having being asked first.<br/>
Plus, what if my box goes missing? I just think anytime you are going to do<br/>
anything that has to do with another letterbox, its clues, or it's location<br/>
you should have the permission of the creator of that letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing to remember is that any area that has people poking around<br/>
and prodding in several different area's is liable to draw attention, so by<br/>
planting a letterbox to close to another I think we jeopardize compromising<br/>
all boxes in that area when people start wondering what we were poking<br/>
around for. I recently planted a series geared for children where all the<br/>
letterboxes are within about 30ft of each other and even doing that<br/>
purposely I was concerned about how much attention I would draw to that<br/>
location.  But it was an experiment - so we'll see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, just my two cents worth - <br/>
