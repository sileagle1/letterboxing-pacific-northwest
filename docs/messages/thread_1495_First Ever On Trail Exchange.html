Park box. We were ever so pleased to meet Nomadic Man while we were<br/>
searching. He had been there for several hours looking, while we had just<br/>
gotten there. While him and I were debating whether we were at the right<br/>
tree, Tooth Fairy found the box!<br/>
<br/>
Nice box and we had a wonderful time exchanging stamps and conversation!<br/>
