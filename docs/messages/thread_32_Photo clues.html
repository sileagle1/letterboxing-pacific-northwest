                    <div class="plaintext-content">The national Orienteering magazine has an annual contest that is a <br/>
photo clues one.<br/>
<br/>
For those not familiar with orienteering, the maps are highly <br/>
detailed with features found in the environment.  Using the photos <br/>
you found the spot on the map.  Usually a series of about 15 photos <br/>
made up a complete course.  I could rarely get more than 5 or 6 spots <br/>
identified, though I do not think I ever really TRIED hard enough.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of a photo challenge.  If somehow thumbnail size <br/>
photos could be used, perhaps 4 per page.<br/>
<br/>
Or photos get you to a location then you have a written clue then a <br/>
photo etc.<br/>
<br/>
It could be very challenging in an environment where the plants and <br/>
trees change with the seasons. <br/>
<br/>
Hint - o - the- day.  A large ziplock bag is a great rain cover for <br/>
clues.<br/>
