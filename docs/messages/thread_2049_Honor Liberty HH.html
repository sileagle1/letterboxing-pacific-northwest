Thanks Wingnut, I knew you posted the location, but I could figure out <br>
why no one had picked her up and reposted the new location.<br>

Yes, I will post location when I move her.  Took her home today for<br>
some TLC and to spend time looking at all the entries.  I think I must<br>
have picked her up quite shortly after Double Tree left her.  I all<br>
the books I visited today 1-9-2006 and now on coming home find it is<br>
only the 8th, so I think I was just behind Double Tree at the place I<br>
found Honor Liberty (Favorite Hat) and maybe just ahead of Maiden,<br>
maybe behind her, although I don't see Maiden's stamp in the log book.<br>
 I'm sure folks will be anxious to hear where I put her and will make<br>
a mad rush.  What a fascinating hitchhiker, and what a fabulous idea.<br>
 Thank you for the "honor" of having this image in my book.<br>
