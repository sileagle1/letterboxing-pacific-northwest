Yes, I will post location when I move her.  Took her home today for<br/>
some TLC and to spend time looking at all the entries.  I think I must<br/>
have picked her up quite shortly after Double Tree left her.  I all<br/>
the books I visited today 1-9-2006 and now on coming home find it is<br/>
only the 8th, so I think I was just behind Double Tree at the place I<br/>
found Honor Liberty (Favorite Hat) and maybe just ahead of Maiden,<br/>
maybe behind her, although I don't see Maiden's stamp in the log book.<br/>
 I'm sure folks will be anxious to hear where I put her and will make<br/>
a mad rush.  What a fascinating hitchhiker, and what a fabulous idea.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks to Double Tree, Maiden, and Funhog for letting us know <br/>
that she <br/>
&gt; &gt; has been found. Hopefully the finder will post the new location <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; keep her moving. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Never Forget!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, I will post location when I move her.  Took her home today for<br/>
&gt; some TLC and to spend time looking at all the entries.  I think I <br/>
must<br/>
&gt; have picked her up quite shortly after Double Tree left her.  I all<br/>
&gt; the books I visited today 1-9-2006 and now on coming home find it <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; only the 8th, so I think I was just behind Double Tree at the <br/>
place I<br/>
&gt; found Honor Liberty (Favorite Hat) and maybe just ahead of Maiden,<br/>
&gt; maybe behind her, although I don't see Maiden's stamp in the log <br/>
book.<br/>
&gt; I'm sure folks will be anxious to hear where I put her and will <br/>
make<br/>
&gt; a mad rush.  What a fascinating hitchhiker, and what a fabulous <br/>
idea.<br/>
&gt; Thank you for the "honor" of having this image in my book.<br/>
