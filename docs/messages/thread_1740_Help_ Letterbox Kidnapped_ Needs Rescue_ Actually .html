I just found out that the letterbox that was kidnapped was the<br/>
Campfire box near Rhododendron, Oregon! So that means that the box is<br/>
actually near Portland and not Seattle. <br/>
<br/>
Roslyn Lake Park is located 3.5 miles north of the city of Sandy.<br/>
Travel east on Highway 26 to Sandy, turn north on Ten Eyck Road and<br/>
watch for signs.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is going to be out that way and can pick up the box for me,<br/>
I would be forever grateful! <br/>

opp's forgot to add where the box is supposedly located in the park:<br/>
<br/>
" It's<br/>
now at<br/>
Roslyn Lake State Park, about 3 feet to the right of a sign about<br/>
Alcoholic<br/>
Beverages being Prohibited, hiding under a bushy fern. "<br/>

If no one has rescued this little gem before the end of the week, I can probably pick it <br/>
up on the way to Central Oregon next weekend. Since I was there when you hid this <br/>
one originally, I can try to rehide it in the same spot, too. Let's hope the mushroom <br/>
hunting kidnapper hasn't totally ruined the original hiding place. Funhog<br/>
