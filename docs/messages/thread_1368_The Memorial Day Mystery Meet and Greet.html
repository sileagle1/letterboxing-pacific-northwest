<br/>
I wanted to also take the time to thank dvn2rckr for putting this <br/>
together, as belated as it is. It was great meeting everyone, and <br/>
see all the new faces that make up this great hobby and being able <br/>
to go out and do some letterboxing in the Tacoma area. If any of you <br/>
are ever down in the Portland area please let pandora and I know. If <br/>
at all possible we would love to meet up and do some boxing down <br/>
here with you. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well.<br/>

Yahoo may break that apart, so, if it appears on two lines, then copy and paste it back together in your browsers <br/>
address field and it should work just fine.<br/>
