                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello!  Just wanted to say thanks to the warm welcomes I've <br>
received.  We (the family and I) managed to get out last Friday <br>
afternoon and hit our *FIRST* letterbox.  It was a new one in <br>
Silverdale, WA: Clear Creek Trail.  It was a good start for us, as we <br>
have two little boys.  The trail was short, and the clues were easy, <br>
but fun nonetheless.  The boys were just as excited as I was in <br>
searching for the next clue.  I've read many times over that this can <br>
be an addicting hobby and now I see why.  I'm already planning on our <br>
next hunt.  Hopefully soon!  <br>
Thanks again!<br>
