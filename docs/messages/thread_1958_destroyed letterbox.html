Post the name and location (City) of the box on this site because it could be <br/>
that it was adopted by another letterboxer. If no one replies or claims it then <br/>
maybe you could adopt it.<br/>

There's not really anything left to adopt- one remaining stamp out of the<br/>
several that were there, the box itself totally destroyed. The location<br/>
itself might not be best anyway- it's very high traffic.<br/>
<br/>
This was the box:<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/jmwestin/Learninglb.html<br/>
<br/>
I guess if I don't hear anything soon, I'll try and contact the school.<br/>
(Um, yeah, do you have an afterschool letterboxing club? Is there someone<br/>
I can talk to ..?) Erk.<br/>
