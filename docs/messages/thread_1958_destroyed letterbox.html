It's been a few weeks now and I've heard no response. I'd like to make it<br>

Post the name and location (City) of the box on this site because it could be <br>
that it was adopted by another letterboxer. If no one replies or claims it then <br>
maybe you could adopt it.<br>

There's not really anything left to adopt- one remaining stamp out of the<br>
several that were there, the box itself totally destroyed. The location<br>
itself might not be best anyway- it's very high traffic.<br>
<br>
This was the box:<br>
http://www.geocities.com/jmwestin/Learninglb.html<br>
<br>
I guess if I don't hear anything soon, I'll try and contact the school.<br>
(Um, yeah, do you have an afterschool letterboxing club? Is there someone<br>
I can talk to ..?) Erk.<br>
