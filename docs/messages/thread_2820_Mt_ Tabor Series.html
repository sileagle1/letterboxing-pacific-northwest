this series today right where it belongs - a couple of people had<br/>
reported it missing, and I've discussed it with several friends, so I<br/>
will just eat my hat on this one.  In fact, the whole series is intact<br/>
and ready for visitors.  You get carvings from three different people<br/>
in the series - a treat indeed.<br/>

Can't WAIT to see that lovely Pacific Ocean this trip - the one thing <br/>
I really miss from my Bay Area/West Coast days....<br/>

Btw, Portlanders: I'll be replacing the logbook for Art Exposure this <br/>
trip, probably *right before* I leave (on 8/13), so if you haven't <br/>
yet done this box and would like to see the stamps from PREvious <br/>
visitors, try and make a point of doing so in the next week.  <br/>
Otherwise your ink will find clean, new (and small) pages when you <br/>

What is so ironic is that when I hid #1 I was just stewing about it<br/>
all day and that night and for days to follow that it was in a poor<br/>
spot and would probably go missing because of passers-by stumbling<br/>
onto it or dogs sniffing it out - it's hard to find good spots in such<br/>
a highly-used area.  I even went up there a few days later to relocate<br/>
it, stood around for about 15 minutes to assess the traffic, and<br/>
changed my mind thinking it might be alright after all.  I considered<br/>
it the easiest of the 3 to find and the clues the most direct and<br/>
"easy" - a very good example of what people often think when they are<br/>
writing clues, that they are hard or easy or whatever, and then<br/>
everyone else finds them just the opposite.  One of the things I find<br/>
really fascinating about letterboxing, because I'm especially<br/>
interested in words and word usage and language in general - it's<br/>
basically what I do for a living.  I'll be looking for a box and think<br/>
to myself "well just what the *(#%$ to they mean by "stump" or "big<br/>
fir tree" or some other term, when I'm sure it was obvious to the<br/>
clue-writer.  I have a box at Falls Creek, for which I thought the<br/>
clue was cutesy but easy and obvious (one of my rare clues of FEW<br/>
words), and yet only one person has been able to find it.  I guess the<br/>
old saying about beauty is true even applied to letterboxing clues -<br/>
"it's in the eye of the beholder."<br/>
