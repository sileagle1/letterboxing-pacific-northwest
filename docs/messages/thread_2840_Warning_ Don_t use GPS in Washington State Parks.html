Geocaches and letterboxes are not prohibited in Washington State<br/>
Parks, but do require permits. This is covered by this directive -<br/>
<br/>
http://www.parks.wa.gov/downloads/Directive%2006-01%20Geocaching%20%20letterboxing%20and%20related%20activities.doc<br/>
<br/>
If you search for 'washington state parks letterboxing' on Google it<br/>
is the first hit.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes are lumped together with geocaches by the Deputy Director<br/>
and all are referred to as 'caches' at times in the directive so don't<br/>
be confused. If you read the entire document it's clear that the rules<br/>
apply to all versions of our game of finding hidden containers in the<br/>
woods.<br/>
<br/>
You letterbox wasn't pulled because geocaches are illegal and it was<br/>
mistaken for one, it was pulled because you are required to get a<br/>
permit to place it but you have not done so.<br/>

It's nice they have a policy and I suspect most boxes and caches in WA<br/>
St. parks are not properly permitted, but I don't believe for a minute<br/>
the the ranger in question knows or cares that they can be permitted,<br/>
has any idea where to find the paperwork to back up the permission, or<br/>

The state park rangers see too many people at their worst<br/>

Actually the ranger at this park is not allowing permits, so a permit<br/>
is not an option. They are not approving any permits for any geocaches<br/>
or letterboxes there. They did give me back my stamp, and I'm just<br/>
going to send it out as a postal.<br/>
