Park on Sunday. We started with the dvn2r ckr gang's West<br>
Point Mule. What a fun way to start our afternoon in the<br>
sun. He's a very cute mule who seems somewhat lonely - he<br>
hasn't had a visitor since may of last year! Go and do this<br>
box!<br>
<br>
We then head over to the Wolf Tree Trail to do Candlelight &<br>
lp's boxes. Unfortunately, it was a sad sad trip. I looked<br>
for the Blizard Boxes before and found two of them missing.<br>
Nory wasn't with me that trip but together we found that<br>
four of them are gone. Very very sad. And then, to make<br>
things worse, we went looking for the Funny Little Man. He<br>
seems to be gone too. What is up with the Wolf Tree Trail?<br>
It's such a great trail but all of the gorgeous trees seem<br>
to be taking all of the letterboxes!<br>
