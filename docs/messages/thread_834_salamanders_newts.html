You've seen your share of rough-skinned newts in water or on land, right?  <br/>
Newts are salamanders, but are generally distinguished from other salamanders by <br/>
their rough-textured skins.  Rough-skinned newts are the bold ones that <br/>
saunter about in broad daylight.  You know, the ones with the orange bellies.  (Ooh <br/>
boy, don't get a naturalist started--oops, too late.)  Here's the reason for <br/>
the boldness/daylight strolls, the colorful bellies AND the bumpy skin: if you <br/>
annoy these newts, the bumps can secrete a highly-toxic poison--as their <br/>
bright bellies signal.  Luckily, they seem to be pretty easygoing critters-- and <br/>
if you get one cranky enough, it'll arc up both its head &amp; tail to better show <br/>
off its belly and let you know you you're messing with.  Their toxin can't <br/>
penetrate human skin, but it's a smart idea to wash/rinse your hands after <br/>
handling one--even a well-adjusted, non-cranky one--since you don't want to injest <br/>
any of the stuff by accident (via your sandwich or whatever).  There is a <br/>
reported case of campers who died after inadvertantly boiling a newt in their <br/>
coffee pot that had been left out overnight.  But generations of West Coast <br/>
schoolkids (and plenty of us adults too) have handled zillions of these things <br/>
without keeling over, so there's no need to be overly worried about holding one, <br/>
either.   <br/>
<br/>
These newts spend most of their time on land--Wild Child picked up 8 or so <br/>
during our recent walk at Milo McIver--and will head for water only around <br/>
mating time--about Dec thru July (depending on elevation, etc). <br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay, I'll stop now.  (But if you want to know who their only predator <br/>
is, let me know!)<br/>

No gnewts.  Dispite thrashing about in some of the most wonderous wet <br/>
places in western washington.  Had a momentary thrill at Rattlesnake <br/>
Ridge, but it turn out to be someones plastic toy.<br/>
