I'm mostly just hanging around in the shadows reading and all that <br/>
stuff.  I'm in Colorado but will be retiring near Eugene in the next <br/>
few years.  We were up letterboxing earlier this year and will be <br/>
again as much as possible before the move.  <br/>
I've been reading this board for awhile to keep up with what y'all <br/>
are doing up there so I can join in on the fun one of these days!  <br/>
I'll most likely plant a box next time we visit. <br/>
Nice to meet you all!<br/>

Winter and the holidays is effecting everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, the Brat Pack spent Veterans Day out letterboxing. We left 3 new<br/>
boxes in the Portland area for others to search for and found Adele and<br/>
Sophia. Both of those boxes are wonderful. They are from a new carver and<br/>
have only had a couple of visitors each. I highly encourage everyone to go<br/>
and give these some attention. <br/>
<br/>
I think our best story was up in Olympia on the 6th. The Brat Pack had gone<br/>
to say goodbye to Team Ravyenhaus and decided to pick up a series in<br/>
Millersylvania Park. It was a series planted for the Boooogie in the Park<br/>
gathering that we just hadn't had time to get to. We hit the trail at 3:30,<br/>
in search of a man that had been bitten by a creature of some sort. It was a<br/>
wonderful walk through dark forests and swamp lands. We had no problem<br/>
finding boxes one and two and were completely entranced with the story line.<br/>
The sun had started to fade but we continued on dauntlessly, hoping to find<br/>
those last two boxes before calling it a night. By the time we got to the<br/>
correct area for box 3, we needed the flashlight to read the clues. I broke<br/>
out my little LED flashlight and we read the clues and searched the area.<br/>
Didn't find the box, but decided to head on. The light continued to fade and<br/>
the sounds of the forest were coming alive. We heard an Eagle screech as it<br/>
passed overhead and all kinds of things scampering (lurking) in the bushes.<br/>
We kept the flashlight off, trying to save the batteries in case we needed<br/>
them later. The moonlight was reflecting off the fallen maple leaves giving<br/>
the trail and unearthly glow. We found the correct intersection but by now<br/>
all light had left the forest. The last clue required us to triangulate off<br/>
mossy trees and without feeling up every tree, there was no way to tell<br/>
which ones were mossy. We had to call it quits and concede that the monster<br/>
had alluded us this time and we would have to search again for it. Just<br/>
about then we figured out that we had no idea if this trail looped back to<br/>
the parking lot or if we needed to go back the way we came. My flashlight<br/>
happened to swing across a sign that told us a building near where we had<br/>
parked was .3 of a mile a different direction, so we headed that way.  We<br/>
finally stumbled upon the Environmental Learning Center where the SCA was<br/>
camping out. Being the kind souls that they are, they offered us hot food<br/>
and drink but we kept on the other half mile or so to the car. Just as we<br/>
broke into the last clearing an owl called to us. We thanked him for being<br/>
our guiding spirit and happily collapsed into the car. It was one of the<br/>
most memorable letterboxing trips I've been on so far. And of course we<br/>
learned one lesson, when letterboxing in November, BRING A BIGGER<br/>
FLASHLIGHT!<br/>

" anyone been on the quest for Cloaked Letterboxer's <br/>
lost love? This is one of the most exciting things to appear on the<br/>
Northwest scene in <br/>
ages... challenging and top rate in every way."<br/>
<br/>
I know that of several Boxers that have ventured this way - pandora and I<br/>
included - and all of them have given nothing but praise and amazement in<br/>
regards to this mysterious quest. If any of you have not been able to being<br/>
the journey as well - I would certainly encourage you to do so. So far this<br/>
woman's boxes are by far the best I have ever personally seen - on many<br/>
levels. And I will venture to say that the boxes she has out right now when<br/>
tracked down are not to overly difficult given the weather conditions this<br/>
time of year - so don't miss out and go for them!<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that those of us graced with her note - can pass the<br/>
torch so to speak to other fellow Boxers -PRIVATELY- so if you are wanting<br/>
to be a part of this experience I would encourage you to get a hold of<br/>
someone who has it in their possession. Plus be watchful while you are out<br/>
boxing - you never know what you might find. Also from what I have been able<br/>
to gather I think that the ones that have already begun the quest with her<br/>
are in store for yet another saga to her tale so keep your eyes peeled - and<br/>
ears open - it feels like there is a chilling atramentous mystery on the<br/>
wind. To add to all of this - it looks to me like the wonderfully mysterious<br/>
woman has hired a certain stealth-detective so I am sure we are in store for<br/>
some wonderful findings from him as well. <br/>
<br/>
All of this is just awesome whoever you are you have my sincere thanks - and<br/>
this time of year it really gives us Boxers a way to stay ingrained in this<br/>
hobby - even if you work all week until the late night hours. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well. <br/>
