                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of a LbPNW Patch and also the idea of a poll to <br/>
determine the favorite.  Thanks to everyone for submitting their <br/>
really cool designs.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel compelled to point out however that a simple 1-person, 1-<br/>
vote poll when there are 12 different entries is probably not the <br/>
best way to determine an overall consensus.  For example if the poll <br/>
ended today, the winner would have only 27% of the vote -- meaning <br/>
that three-quarters of people voted for something else.<br/>
<br/>
In these kind of cases, there are much better ways of getting a true <br/>
sense of what the group desires.  In no particular order:<br/>
<br/>
1.  We could use a weighted vote in which people could vote for <br/>
multiple entries; for example, someone could vote for their favorite <br/>
(3 points), their 2nd favorite (2 points), and their 3rd favorite (1 <br/>
point).  You get a much better idea this way of which designs have <br/>
broad appeal.<br/>
<br/>
2.  We could use "approval voting", in which everyone can have as <br/>
many votes as they want; for example, for EACH entry, 1 through 12, <br/>
you can vote whether it is acceptable or not.  If you like them ALL, <br/>
then each gets a vote.  If you think 4 of them are acceptable, only <br/>
vote for those 4.  If you like only 1, then just vote for it.<br/>
<br/>
3. We could use a run-off system.  This might be the easiest system <br/>
if we want to use Yahoo's automated polling feature.  For example, <br/>
after this poll closes, we take the top 5 vote-getters (or all <br/>
entries that capture say, at least 10% of the total vote) and vote <br/>
again.  If no single entry gets more than half of the vote, then more <br/>
choices are eliminated and then we vote again until we have a <br/>
majority winner.   <br/>
<br/>
If there is a stalemate, it goes to the House of Representatives and <br/>
they decide.<br/>
<br/>
Just kidding.  I don't mean to stir up trouble or take this whole <br/>
voting thing too seriously, but I do strongly believe that simple 1-<br/>
vote elections with a huge number of entries are highly <br/>
undemocratic.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also a few other issues like the fact that Thunderbird's <br/>
patch 2 and patch 3 are VERY similar to one another.  Each one <br/>
separately is currently in 6th or 7th place in the voting, but if you <br/>
added the votes together, it would be almost tied for 2nd.   <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents....<br/>

<br/>
As I understand it, the polling system on Yahoo actually allows this<br/>
if the poll creator allows it. =)<br/>
<br/>
I tend to agree with Green Guillemot, though. Seems like there are<br/>
problems with the current voting system. *nodding*<br/>
