<br/>
We're working together on a series in Salem, OR.  It will be an<br/>
"in-progress" series, and we will be adding to it until May 2006 or so<br/>
(when we graduate).  There are a few things about this series that make<br/>
it very different from other boxes:<br/>
<br/>
1.	This is an "in-progress" series, so we'll be adding to it as we<br/>
go.  Hopefully there will be at least four boxes in the series by May<br/>
14th, when we go home for the summer.<br/>
2.	 Each box must be found to even get the clue for the next.  This<br/>
means that we will be maintaining the boxes very carefully, so no dead<br/>
boxes!<br/>
3.	The clues are insanely hard-so you get to meet us when you need<br/>
a hint.<br/>
<br/>
The series is posted on the new LBNA site and at Wizbang's letterboxing<br/>
site:  http://www.willamette.edu/~alorente/letterboxing/<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>
