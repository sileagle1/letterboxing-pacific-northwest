The weekend get together in beautiful (and very WET) BC was good fun. Many thanks <br/>
to the Secret Gardeners for introducing us to Canada's Thanksgiving, a quaint historic <br/>
town and a wonderful park. It was especially fun to meet the bearers of the <br/>
letterboxing torch in this province, Zara and CSB. <br/>
<br/>
These boxers seem to be the only serious hobbyists in the area. If anyone visits their <br/>
stomping grounds, it'd be a great gift to leave a box or two behind for them to find. <br/>
As always, meeting with old friends, as well as making new ones, added to the <br/>
enjoyment of this intimate event. Funhog<br/>

Just a note to say how much I enjoyed Saturdays gathering in Fort Langley. It was a bit wet, but still great fun. It was nice to put faces to the names I have seen posted here so many times. What a nice bunch of people! And some came all the way from Portland, wow! We hope to get to see you all again sometime. Great job on the event stamp Ryan, and last but not least a great big Thank-you to the Secret Gardeners for hosting this fun event. It was great to meet you too, after finding soooo many of your wonderful boxes. My clothes are now dry and my feet rested, I'm ready to hit the trails again. :)<br/>

I'll just pop in long enough to say it was a lot of fun at the<br/>

hosting the event.  It might be the first letterboxing event in<br/>
Canada, but I'm sure there will be many more to come!  =)<br/>

Funhog and I planted a few boxes before leaving that wet, wet country.<br/>
 I can't speak for Funhog, but my clues should be up in a couple of<br/>
days.  Being in the rush we were, I didn't even have time to do a<br/>
properly annoying job of it, so it's likely to be a very easy,<br/>
straight-forward one!  =)<br/>

Wow!  What a fun time--in spite of the liquid sunshine!  Many kudos <br/>
to the Secret Gardeners and Canada Goose for planning &amp; organizing <br/>
this neat event.  We really enjoyed seeing our 'friends in <br/>
letterboxing' and meeting new friends, too.  What delightful <br/>
letterboxes in the area, too!  My children enjoyed the festivities <br/>
and already can't wait to return.<br/>
<br/>
After the gathering, we braved the 'tarp-draped tent' one more <br/>
night, found a few more Ft Langley LB (BTW 'Wood' was damaged--we <br/>
only found the lid &amp; the stamp and tucked them into a ziploc bag and <br/>
hid it in the dust at the base of the hollow tree) and then worked <br/>
our way over to N. Vancouver.  We sought out the Lynn Canyon <br/>
Letterboxes (did you know the suspension bridge is closed for a <br/>
while?) and they were very much alive &amp; well although a bit more <br/>
challenging without access to the 'bridge' this month.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we visited the 'tourist trap' of Capilano Suspension Bridge--<br/>
really to explore the Tree Top Adventure.  The kids loved the 'Swiss <br/>
Family Robinson' style tree house and crossing the incredibly wobbly <br/>
suspension bridge--a bit scary when you're one adult with two little <br/>
ones and only two hands available.  Mom's still not sure if <br/>
she 'enjoyed' that part of it.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, thanks so much for planning &amp; participating in this event!  <br/>
It truly was the 'jump start' we needed to get our ducks in a row to <br/>
cross the border (passports-wise).  Now, we'll be able to come &amp; go <br/>
anytime!<br/>
<br/>
See you at the next Canadian BC Gathering!!!<br/>

You only have ONE BOX left in BC to find???     I know there aren't that <br/>
many here but there's a few that you can't exactly do on a long <br/>
weekend.  Atlin?  Queen Charlottes?  I lived at Tlell in the Charlottes for <br/>
a while and I'd love to find that Pesuta box.<br/>

Just wanted to thank the Secret Gardeners and Canada Goose for<br/>
organising the Thanksgiving gathering. It was really nice to see<br/>
everyone and to finally meet the infamous Ryan! The rain didn't dampen<br/>
our spirits and we all had fun. It is a lovely park and we found some<br/>
nice boxes (but not all - we'll have to come back!)<br/>

&gt;Get lots of rest and stay warm.We are excited to hear that you left some <br/>
&gt;boxes behind. CSB and I had only one box here in B.C. left to find. Thanks <br/>
&gt;to you and Ryan and Funhog we'll have some more. :) Get well soon!<br/>

You only have ONE BOX left in BC to find???     I know there aren't that <br/>
many here but there's a few that you can't exactly do on a long <br/>
weekend.  Atlin?  Queen Charlottes?  I lived at Tlell in the Charlottes for <br/>
a while and I'd love to find that Pesuta box.<br/>
