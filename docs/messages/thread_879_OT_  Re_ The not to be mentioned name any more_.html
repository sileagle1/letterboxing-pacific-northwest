                    <div class="plaintext-content">Being an "Olympic" Peninsula native, I remember way back when when the "Olympic" Committee was raising a stink about requiring Olympia and the Olympic National Park (and Forest) and all those places and businesses that used Olympia and Olympic in their name to change because they were infringing on their copyrighted name.  The overwhelming response was, go ahead, give it your best shot, if you try we will own the name and you will have to change, because the name was here before you started your silly games.  The final press release restated their 'ownership' of the word olympic and all its varios forms, and that since the name had been used in this area for a long time, they were going to be nice and allow it to be used for a while longer.  It has never been mentioned again.  Thankfully!<br/>
