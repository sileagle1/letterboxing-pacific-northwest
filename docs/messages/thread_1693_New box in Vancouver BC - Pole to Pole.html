We saw that there were no boxes listed for Stanley Park in Vancouver,<br/>
and decided to remedy the situation. At the gathering, we were warned<br/>
by locals that a box in Stanley Park is likely to be short-lived (too<br/>
much traffic) so I hope at least one person gets it before it<br/>
disappears.<br/>
<br/>
I won't have time to get it onto the website for a bit, so I'm posting<br/>
the clues here for any intrepid early finders.<br/>
<br/>
Pole to Pole<br/>
<br/>
Stanley Park, Vancouver, B.C.<br/>
<br/>
Start at the famous Stanley Park totem poles. Go along the path to<br/>
your left and follow it to the street. Look to your right and see 3<br/>
poles of another kind, near a lighthouse. Standing in front of these<br/>
poles, go straight ahead south. Cross the street carefully and go up<br/>
the path straight in front of you, to a mossy rock in front of a<br/>
multi-trunked maple tree. Standing in front of the rock, you will see<br/>
another maple tree at about 130 degrees. Nestled under the fern<br/>
growing at the side of this tree is the pole that is your goal.<br/>
