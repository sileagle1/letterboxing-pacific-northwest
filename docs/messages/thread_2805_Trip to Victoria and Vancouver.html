<br>
Storm Wind, Lil' Dragon, and I will be traveling to Victoria, BC this<br>
week, and will be there from Wednesday evening on the 4th until Monday<br>
morning, when we'll be heading to Vancouver until Friday the 13th<br>
(great day to travel, yes?)  <br>
<br>
We would love to meet with some local boxers in both towns, for<br>
exchanges and coffee or lunch or something.  The only day we're not<br>
available to meet is Saturday, we're getting married that day!  <br>
<br>
So, anyone up to meeting?<br>
<br>
