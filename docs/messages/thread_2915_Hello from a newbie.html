<br/>
Am new to the list, as well as to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Had my first excursion looking for boxes this weekend, and sadly of <br/>
the three on the agenda (Breakout Bear, Fireman's Park, and Sea Otter <br/>
*all in the Tacoma area* ), NONE of them were located.....sadly they <br/>
had all been either removed or stolen. *huge frowns*<br/>
<br/>
However, I am not giving up on this letterboxing stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I am sure there are still many, many boxes still out there waiting to <br/>
be discovered.<br/>
<br/>
And well if I don't find any here in the Pac NW before August, no <br/>
worries here because I am planning on a trip back east to visit <br/>
family, and have learned of the State Park hosted boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Apparently the Connecticut Dept. of Environmental Protection has <br/>
placed letterboxes in all of the state's parks. <br/>
<br/>
I am planning on trying to collect as many stamps in my book as I can <br/>
during my 10 days there.<br/>
<br/>
Figured I would leave the link for the D.E.P site about the <br/>
letterboxes enclosed for any who may be interested. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me join the group, look forward to sharing my <br/>
experiences in letterboxing with you, and possibly picking up some <br/>
useful tips or ideas from you all.<br/>

letterboxing. Be careful, the letterboxes are soooo plentiful back <br/>
there that they sometimes will jump into your backpack without your <br/>
knowledge! :-)<br/>
