indeed missing both times (one visit during the flood/another visit <br/>
after the flood)--we carved a replacement, went back to rehide it <br/>
and lo, and behold, the original letterbox was right there back in <br/>
its spot!  Hmmmmm?????  Not sure what's going on here but we pulled <br/>
the clues to this box way back in April--after having it listed as <br/>
possibly missing for several months and definitely missing since <br/>
April til now.  The oddest thing, though, is that there have been 7 <br/>
groups of letterboxers who have visited the box during that <br/>
timeframe the box was 'missing' and not one let us know the box was <br/>
there.  Anyways, the box is still there, in its proper hiding spot <br/>
for anybody who wants to look for it again.  I wonder if somebody <br/>
took it on a vacation for a bit???<br/>

Perplexed...<br/>

By the way, the blueberries are wonderful right now!!!  Such a bonus <br/>
of a treat after a long letterboxing hike!  I think we spent about <br/>
$1.50 on a quart of blueberries yesterday!!!<br/>
