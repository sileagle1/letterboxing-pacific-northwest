I like to carry an umbrella when it's raining. =)<br>
<br>
But usually I just opt not to go out. I'm a fair-weather letterboxer,<br>
deep down inside. *nodding*<br>
<br>
Seasons don't much matter--I'll go out regardless of the temperature,<br>
but if it's raining, I'd much rather stay indoors and read a book instead.<br>
<br>
But for those times when Amanda drags me out into the cold, wet rain<br>
while I'm kicking and screaming, I want an umbrella. =)<br>

the cold, but more about how deep the snow is.  I can do some local boxes<br>
during some of the winter months, but most of the fun boxes are up on<br>
mountain trails and I have a hard enough time finding the box when it isn't<br>
covered in many, many feet of snow.  Locally it isn't as deep and will<br>
occasionally melt so I can get out (not that anyone else is out planting<br>
them though).<br>
<br>
I'm really looking forward to getting out and finding some letterboxes when<br>
I come up in the middle of March.  It will probably be my first serious<br>
boxing for the year--that is if we don't have our 2nd annual Moab Box on the<br>
Rocks before that.  There has been discussion of heading down again to the<br>
desert trails.  Any of you are welcome if you want to get out of the rain!<br>

If I'm going with the kidlets/hubby...if it's raining, it will <br>
probably be a very short trip.  But admittingly...some of the best <br>
eagle watching has been when the weather is 'changing' and the raptors <br>
are roosting in the alders and big leaf maples when there is no leaves <br>
on them.  <br>
If it's me and the hound, the only thing that deters me is how light <br>
it is...some of my best hunting days are when its blustery all over <br>
and I have the trail/park/area all to myself!  If it is raining hard, <br>
I wear one of those plastic rain slickers from the dollar store.  It <br>
works to keep me dry and it's see thru enough that I just do my <br>
stamping in under it, so the box stays dry also.  Then the hound is <br>
off to find the next puddle!  <br>

It's the lack of light in the evening that affects my activities the<br>
most, not the weather itself.  I personally like boxing in the rain,<br>
but I've had it with trying to hold a giant golf umbrella between my<br>
knees while stamping in, squatting all the while as my legs fall<br>
sleep.  I think I'll get a rain poncho to use as a hands-free<br>
umbrella.  The reason I like boxing in the bad weather is that there<br>
are so few people out and about.  I've been to a lot of boxes this<br>
winter that I really can't imagine visiting with any discretion at all<br>
during the better weather.<br>

<br>
Wait a minute!  I have to do that in the non-rainy season too.  Nevermind.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The rain slows down my letterboxing because I hate to introduce any<br>
trace of moisture into a box. Luckily, the rainy winter months are<br>
prime time for viewing the visiting winter birds. So, I still grab the<br>
Gore-Tex and get out on the trails. Hiking and birding in the rain are<br>
good fun with the right gear.<br>
<br>
When it's roasting hot, I avoid those hard uphill treks. Those, I<br>
usually save for cooler days. The wildflower bloom in the Spring<br>
always takes me up Dog Mountain. There are a couple of new boxes up<br>
there that I'm just itchin' to get come a cool day in May or early June. <br>
<br>
When it's icy cold, I avoid letterbox series with multiple boxes on a<br>
short hike. I never have time to warm up my frigid fingers between<br>
stops. Then, I head for one box on a longer hike. Funhog<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This may get me lynched, but I *adore* rain, maybe because growing up in interior Alaska <br>
we didn't see much of it.  Sixty below actual temperature (not just wind chill)?  You bet.  A <br>
lot of rain?  No.  I think it is my parents' fault.  They used to take us out in the summer <br>
rains to pick mushrooms.  That was the best time to go, because the really fresh ones--<br>
those the bugs hadn't been able to get to--popped out of the dirt when it rained.  So I <br>
have fond memories of walking around in boots and rain poncho with a pocket knife and a <br>
small pail, hunting for mushrooms.  Even if I can't be out in it, the rain makes me happy.  I <br>
think I like the lower barometric pressure, too--I always feel calm and collected when it's <br>
raining.<br>
<br>
So naturally, I *love* letterboxing when it rains.  It's when it's hot that I get fainthearted.  I <br>
can't even *imagine* what it must be like to go letterboxing in Florida...I'd probably melt.<br>
<br>
Hmm...just occurred to me that the old mushroom hunts may be what makes letterboxing <br>
so attractive to me.  That and the treasure hunts my dad used to set up for us.  Just wish <br>
I'd found out about this earlier--I guess I have a lot of time to make up on this one.<br>
