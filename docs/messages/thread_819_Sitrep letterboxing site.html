<br/>
Make a website that addresses a need that is out there.<br/>
<br/>
The majority of talk on the yahoo groups is about which letterboxes <br/>
have been found, which letterboxes are missing, which letterboxes are <br/>
damaged etc etc. <br/>
<br/>
He should make a website that tracks the found letterboxes. You could <br/>
search for specific letterboxes to see who found them and when. You <br/>
could see which parts of the country were busiest! Connecticut had <br/>
100 boxes found today and California only had 12 boxes found! Each <br/>
person could input the data the way they do on the LBNA site with <br/>
planted letterboxes. <br/>
This would keep track of a person's F-count too! <br/>
You could immediately see that Music Woman has found 850 letterboxes <br/>
and 100 hitchhikers.<br/>
You could search for a specific box and see that it was found on Oct. <br/>
3rd by Silent Doug, his 629th find. Another box was found on Sept. <br/>
31st by Wanda and Pete, their 2014th find. <br/>
<br/>
It would be great!!<br/>
I would definitely use a website like that. You could immediately <br/>
pull up your own placed letterboxes and see that they had had <br/>
visitors! And extras like This day in History and Weather links would <br/>
fit in perfectly. <br/>
<br/>
It could be the Sitrep LETTERBOXING SITE!<br/>

<br/>
The plan for the PNWLb website, and I'll gladly change the name to WHATEVER<br/>
works, is to be able to do that. (Smiles)<br/>
<br/>
The clues are simply one field in a database.  If you want to put your clues<br/>
in, do so, otherwise it's NOT required. The site has an icon to indicate the<br/>
status, Green, Yellow or Red, which can only be changed by the owner of that<br/>
box and not by anyone else.  It has ratings, where people can rate the<br/>
letterbox on a scale of one to five.  This is only IF the owner allows it to<br/>
be ranked/rated.  Each box will have the ability to track whether or not you<br/>
personally have located it.<br/>
<br/>
The system already has a "This Day in History", but I need data, as I<br/>
previously requested, to fill it out, currently it's running science and<br/>
history facts.  The weather is an addition I am adding as well, just<br/>
finishing up that one.<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to create something here that will do things the main site does<br/>
not.  Not to replace it, but to fill a need that I perceived.<br/>

This is a fantastic idea. I would love to know if a box has been found recently. That, to me, is a good indicator of (1) how difficult it is and (2) if it might be missing and that I should not feel terrible if I don't find it. (:  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I will add a feature like this to my own web site if you don't build a site exclusively for it. I love Bethany's bulletin-board style for her clues and stuff. It's great to know if and when boxes were last found. <br/>
