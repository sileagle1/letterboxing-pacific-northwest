<br/>
The Flinger is coming up fast...and a GREAT BIG THANK YOU to all that <br/>
have rsvp'd...and especially those who are bringing food!<br/>
<br/>
If you are coming to the Flinger and either live close enough or are <br/>
staying in Chehalis or Centralia...I want to invite you to the PRE-<br/>
Fling at Casa Ramos Mexican Restaurant on Friday night. (There is a <br/>
aq Event Page for it). Great time to ramp up to the main event, get <br/>
some exchanges done and have that plain old good conversation that <br/>
sometimes doesn't happen when we are chasing boxes at events!<br/>
<br/>
We have a ton of people coming...Washington and Oregon will be well <br/>
represented as well as possibly Alaska, California and (wow) <br/>
Connecticut!!!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to see you all there!<br/>
<br/>
Buppsters<br/>
<br/>
**PS...if you want to come but don't want to be on the rsvp <br/>
list...private email me and let me know if you are coming to one or <br/>
both, and I'll adjust my personal rsvp accordingly.  <br/>
