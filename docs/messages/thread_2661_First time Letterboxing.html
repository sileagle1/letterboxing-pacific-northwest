DH & I tried our luck today on A Galloping Gander in Victoria, BC.  <br>
Our very first letterbox search and we had a ball.  We never did <br>
find the letterbox, I had no idea how many 'large, distinctive' <br>
trees that are here and how many 'clusters of roughly seven trees to <br>
the right and slightly downward' are within close proximity to the <br>
aforementioned 'large, distinctive'trees.  All we found was a dirty, <br>
empty, and leaf covered Grocery bag.  I don't think that was IT.  <br>
But we did have a good time and there are a bunch more letterboxes <br>
planted in Victoria.  Never give up, Never surrender.<br>

So many people forget that the point is not just the stamp, but the whole outing.  Don't get discouraged, of course, and maybe if you let it set for a while, you can come back to Gander and it'll suddenly make sense to you.  Everybody's got their story of a big "AH HA!" moment and boxes they've given two, three, or more tries before they found it.  It just makes it that much better when you DO find it!<br>
   <br>
  Happy 'boxing!<br>
