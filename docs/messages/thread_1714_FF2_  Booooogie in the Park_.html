<br>
Come and share in the greatest traditions of All Hallows Eve as we <br>
celebrate a northwest tradition, The second annual Halloween Gathering. <br>
This year, we are holding this event at Millersylvania State Park, just <br>
outside Olympia. From I5, take exit #95 and follow the signs to the <br>
entrance. It looks like we'll be in Kitchen #5, right next to the Camper <br>
check in booth, shouldn't be to hard to find is.<br>
<br>
This years event, aptly named FF2: Booooo-gie in the Park - Echoes of <br>
Times Past plans on being much larger than last year's event. Team Chaos <br>
and Team Rayvenhaus are jointly hosting this event and are each planting <br>
a series of boxes for this event.<br>
<br>
What we would like to also offer is for anyone who can not make it to <br>
this gathering but would still like to participate in some way, to go <br>
ahead and carve up a themed stamp, make a box and ship it to us and we <br>
would be happy to plant and maintain it, listing you as the creator of <br>
that box. If you'd like to take us up on this, contact RayvenMom at <br>
rayvenmom 'at' lbworld.org and she'll give you the snail mail address to <br>
send it to.<br>
<br>
We invite everyone that can make it to come and join us and meet some of <br>
the people behind the posts. There will be a potluck so please bring a <br>
covered dish, a salad, something to eat, enough for your group and share <br>
with your friends. Bring your own sodas or other assorted drinks, (minus <br>
alcohol of course, this is a dry park). Team Chaos, Team Rayvenhaus and <br>
CampFireLady are providing burgers and hot dogs with all the fixings for <br>
40 people.<br>
<br>
Although this is a Halloween themed gathering, this is not a costume <br>
party of any sort.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br>
<br>
Also, here's the info page for the state park:<br>

<br>
Driving directions:<br>
<br>
Millersylvania State Park is located ten miles south of Olympia, Wash., <br>
on the state's western side.<br>
<br>
<br>
 From I-5:<br>
Take exit #95. Drive east, and follow signs to park (about three miles <br>
northeast of the freeway).<br>
<br>
Park opens at 8:00am and closes at 5:00pm (Winter Schedule) We're going <br>
to be there bright and early to secure a spot. The gathering is <br>
scheduled to "begin" at 10:00 am and end at 4:00 pm, however, the park <br>
hours are 8:00 til 5:00 and you're welcome to be there as long as you <br>
want to be there!<br>
<br>
Current reports indicate that there are 17 boxes (At the least) planted <br>
for this event plus an even dozen or more in the park and surrounding areas.<br>
<br>
We are certainly looking forward to everyone coming and joining us in <br>
the enjoyment of our hobby!<br>
