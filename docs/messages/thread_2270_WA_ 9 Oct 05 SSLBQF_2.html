<br/>
WHAT: 2nd South Sound Letterboxing Quest Fest<br/>
<br/>
WHEN: Sunday, 9 Oct 05<br/>
          1pm - 5pm <br/>
<br/>
WHO: Letterboxers (and/or friends thereof)  who want to meet other regional letterboxers<br/>
<br/>
;)          ;;)              =P~          <br/>
<br/>
WHERE:<br/>
<br/>
Ft Steilacoom Park<br/>
8714 87th Ave SW<br/>
Lakewood, WA (United States)<br/>
<br/>
At the picnic tables near the playground with the spires--look for the gaggle of folks with ink-stained fingers.<br/>
<br/>
 3:-O <br/>
<br/>
(this park is an old dairy farm, among other things!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WHY: Just because...<br/>
<br/>
OTHER:<br/>
<br/>
***BRING*** Potluck FOOD (dishes/utensils/drinks for your group) to share if you like.<br/>
<br/>
***BRING** clues to letterboxes hidden in the park AND if you plan on planting boxes in the area, either post the clues to the web the evening before the event or bring several copies of the clues with<br/>
you to distribute to other letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
More details (including map images and a place to RSVP if you feel so inclined) can be found at:<br/>
<br/>
www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=95<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple dozen letterboxes located in the park. There are several dozen letterboxes within a close radius of neighboring villages (Steilacoom, Lakewood, DuPont, Tacoma, Spanaway) around the<br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there,<br/>

IF IT RAINS, THE ALTERNATE SITE WILL BE:<br/>
<br/>
Saltar's Point Park beneath the picnic pavillion about 3 miles West<br/>
in Steilacoom. Find a map to this little known park (and the other<br/>
sites) among the Event Photo Album at:<br/>
<br/>
www.atlasquest.com/gallery/viewalbum.html?gAlbumId=27<br/>
<br/>
Follow the links to the maps, then click on the map icons.  If you can't read the text, then go to your internet web browser tool bar, look for 'view' then click on 'full screen' and it will expand the image to the entire window so you'll be able to read it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finished the event stamp for tomorrow.  It's difficult to come up <br/>
with a stamp theme for an event without a theme!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to meet everyone tomorrow.  Remember--rain or shine it will <br/>
occur!<br/>
<br/>
Shine:  Ft Steilacoom Park offers 'uncovered' picnic tables, portapots <br/>
and possibly 'running water' toilets off in the distance beyond the <br/>
soccer fields.  No access to electrical outlets (although there might <br/>
be some BBQ grills nearby) as far as I can tell.  Handicap accessible.<br/>
<br/>
Rain:  Saltar's Point Park offers a covered picnic pavillion with two <br/>
large picnic tables, a firepit, BBQ grill, plenty of 'countertop' space <br/>
around the 'walls' of the pavillion and a running water toilet/sink <br/>
facility and one of the most incredible views of Puget Sound and <br/>
surrounding islands.  It's basically a rocky/stone beach but the kids <br/>
enjoy it for the 'rock skipping' potential.  Not handicap accessible as <br/>
it requires negotiating a wooden footbridge and about 25 steps down to <br/>
the pavillion.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps with folks planning to attend.<br/>
<br/>
See you tomorrow!<br/>

What if you can't decide if it's raining or shining? You know, liquid<br/>
