                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had this idea for a series of letterboxes on the psalms.<br/>
<br/>
There are 150 psalms -- could be even more than 150, as Psalm 119 has <br/>
22 parts to it and is very long!<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that I could organize it and people across the country <br/>
could volunteer to do a box for a psalm where they live, hopefully <br/>
tying in the theme of the psalm -- mountains mentioned, box near <br/>
mountains; desert, near desert-type landscape (like Eastern Oregon, <br/>
for example.)<br/>
<br/>
After every psalm was taken, people would create boxes &amp; clues, then <br/>
I would have a listing on my own website, with one link on <br/>
letterboxing.org to my website.  This would help the webmasters' <br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
People who were interested or travel alot could even have a "psalm <br/>
book" -- a special logbook for the psalm boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Since there are so many psalms, I see it encompassing the entire <br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
Even if someone wasn't Jewish or Christian, they still might want to <br/>
place and/or find in this series.<br/>
<br/>
I am asking the LbPNW list first to find out your thoughts on this <br/>
before I start the organization and planning prior to posting on LbNA <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you think it is even feasible, sounds like a <br/>
good idea, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your thoughts and time!<br/>
