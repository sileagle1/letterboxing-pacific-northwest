Chapter 3<br/>
<br/>
I woke up to the grating sound of the lady next door yelling at her<br/>
bum husband.  He had lost his job at a nearby lumber mill about 3<br/>
months back and had been on the bottle ever since. She was getting<br/>
tired of him just lying around and was telling him that if he didn't<br/>
find a job in the next week she was going back to her mother in<br/>
Spokane.  Her shrill voice caused my head to pound.  What I get for<br/>
drinking half a bottle of bourbon and sleeping on a worn out old couch.<br/>
<br/>
I got up and changed into a cleaner shirt, gathered my coat, hat and<br/>
gun and left the apartment intending to visit the harbormaster before<br/>
going by the federal building and looking up my buddy at the FBI. I<br/>
turned the corner in the hallway just in time to see my landlord<br/>
knocking on the door of another poor slob in my building who was also<br/>
behind on his rent.  Seeing how the landlord had a scowl on his face I<br/>
decided to go back to my end of the building and up to the roof and<br/>
leave by the fire escape rather than deal with a landlord who was<br/>
already on the attack.  Maybe if this case went well I could pay up my<br/>
back rent and put a down payment on my next months rent too.  Just<br/>
right now I had other plans and didn't want to deal with him.<br/>
<br/>
I made it to the street level and walked to my car. It had been parked<br/>
behind a filling station one block over for the last two weeks since I<br/>
didn't have enough money for gas and oil. I had been using the public<br/>
transit or the old gumshoe express to get around lately. My old car<br/>
started up with some resistance and a cloud of blue smoke.  I pulled<br/>
around to the front of the station and filled up with gas and bought 2<br/>
cans of oil.  One went into the crankcase, the other into the trunk<br/>
for later.<br/>
<br/>
Next I stopped at Stella's for coffee and a fried balogna and egg<br/>
sandwich. I also got some bromo-seltzer for my pounding head.  My<br/>
headache and hunger pangs taken care of I got my late start on the<br/>
day's investigations.<br/>
<br/>
I made it down to the harbormasters office at around 2:30 pm. There<br/>
were not many ships in port at this time and the pilot on duty was<br/>
sitting at a desk reading a newspaper when I went in. I introduced<br/>
myself showing my business card and asked if I could look at the port<br/>
records for the last 2 months.  The junior pilot seemed impressed with<br/>
my credentials and assisted me in looking for any record of a ship<br/>
named Escalate arriving or departing from the port.  We found a record<br/>
dated September 28 of the ship arriving in Olympia.  The record showed<br/>
that the ship was a dry cargo vessel registered in Brazil and owned by<br/>
a company named Dravus Limited headquartered in Glasgow, Scotland. The<br/>
captain's name was listed as Sam McCaw. The manifest showed they were<br/>
carrying a load of mahogany furniture from the Philippines and die cut<br/>
metal wind up toys from Hong Kong. The cargo had been transferred to<br/>
rail and the ship was reloaded with mining equipment headed for<br/>
Alaska. The record showed that the ship departed on October 3.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked the pilot if they would keep a record of what other visits<br/>
this ship may have had over the last few years to the port. He said<br/>
that the records are kept for only one year at their office and then<br/>
forwarded to the maritime museum and library for archiving. I thanked<br/>
him and left.  <br/>
<br/>
Not much here. Maybe try the maritime museum and see what I could find<br/>
out about Dravus Limited and other visits the Escalate had made to<br/>
Olympia.  <br/>
<br/>
The maritime library and museum was located at the top of the hill on<br/>
the west side of the city and overlooked the bay.  It was a newer<br/>
sandstone building and had several flagpoles in front of it flying the<br/>
flags of mostly Pacific nations. There was an old man wearing a<br/>
weathered captains cap and rumpled clothes sitting on a bench outside<br/>
when I arrived feeding the gulls with some scraps of dried bread from<br/>
a paper bag. I tipped my hat to him and said, "Nice weather we're<br/>
having" in sarcastic way. It had been drizzling for 2 weeks straight<br/>
with the mercury hanging in the mid 40's with no end in sight. <br/>
<br/>
He replied, "Finest kind."  Strange.<br/>
<br/>
I entered the museum and followed the directory sign downstairs to the<br/>
library. There was a young woman sitting behind a desk in a light<br/>
brown dress and dark brown knit sweater and wearing bifocals with a<br/>
chain around her neck. Her hair was pulled up in the classic librarian<br/>
bun. I walked up and cleared my throat. She was reading an old thick<br/>
leather bound book. She peered over the bifocals.  I said, "Hello<br/>
Ma'am. My name is Enigma Stealthboxxer. I could use some assistance in<br/>
some research I am doing. Can you direct me to the port records<br/>
section where I might find record of a certain ship that has recently<br/>
been in port here?" <br/>
<br/>
"I'm sorry, sir. Records for ships coming in to port for the last 12<br/>
months are kept at the harbormasters office.  You will have to go and<br/>
inquire there." She immediately returned to her book.<br/>
<br/>
"Actually, I just came from there.  The pilot told me you keep records<br/>
from years prior at this location.  I have already gathered what<br/>
information I could on the ship in question based on its last visit to<br/>
Olympia.  What I am looking for is information on prior visits to this<br/>
port as well as information on the company that owns the ship and its<br/>
captain."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, I am sorry.  We don't get many people looking for the back<br/>
records.  I assumed you were an insurance adjuster looking for cargo<br/>
information for a loss claim.  Let me help you."  She got up and<br/>
escorted me to a bookcase on the far north end of the library. "All<br/>
the port records are kept in this section. There is a separate card<br/>
catalog for the port in this case that is different than the main<br/>
library catalog. You should be able to find what you are looking for<br/>
here. If there is anything else I can assist you with let me know."  <br/>
<br/>
I thanked her and she returned to her desk. I looked over the card<br/>
catalog and opened the drawer for E and began looking for Escalate.  I<br/>
was a bit surprised when I found two cards for the same ship. One<br/>
showed the most recent visit to Olympia as December two years prior as<br/>
well as 4 other visits in the last ten years. The other card was quite<br/>
surprising.  It showed the first visit to the port in 1847 and the<br/>
last visit in 1894. There were over 30 entries on the card showing<br/>
visits to Olympia in that time.  Seems that ship was quite a regular<br/>
visitor to the South Sound in the last century.  <br/>
<br/>
Upon further inspection I noticed something quite odd. The owner of<br/>
the original Escalate and the owner of the modern Escalate were both<br/>
Dravus Limited of Glasgow, Scotland.  Even more surprising was the<br/>
fact that the captain listed for every record on both cards was Sam<br/>
McCaw.  I made some notes in a small notebook I kept tucked in my<br/>
overcoat and replaced the cards.  <br/>
<br/>
I then pulled the records for the three most frequent visits of the<br/>
Escalate from the bookcases and laid out the records on a table to try<br/>
to find any more information I could about any cargoes or destinations<br/>
that might show a pattern.  All the records from the last three visits<br/>
showed the typical cargoes of consumer goods from the orient coming in<br/>
and industrial equipment and general supplies going out to Alaska.<br/>
However what was not typical was that each record of cargo going out<br/>
showed at least one piece of mining equipment being shipped to<br/>
Anchorage by a company called Geraldson Corporation based in Denver,<br/>
Colorado. A pattern. What did it mean? The only thing certain was that<br/>
the Escalate was getting what seemed to be pretty regular business<br/>
from the Geraldson Corporation.<br/>
<br/>
The shipping records in this section went back to 1905. I wanted to<br/>
see if the library had any records for the earlier Escalate just on a<br/>
whim.  I walked back to the desk and the librarian put down her book<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, Mr. Stealthboxxer, did you find everything you were looking for?"<br/>
<br/>
"I did find some of what I am looking for.  Perhaps you can help me<br/>
further. Does this library contain port records from the late 1800's?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, we do have another room of archives going back to the mid<br/>
1800's. The only people who ever look in there are historians though.<br/>
 I can't imagine your insurance company could be interested in<br/>
shipping in the last century."<br/>
<br/>
"Actually, I'm not really an insurance adjuster, ma'am. I'm really a<br/>
private investigator and I am working on a missing person's case."<br/>
<br/>
She looked me up and down a good one at hearing that. "Your missing<br/>
person must be pretty old for you to be looking at shipping records<br/>
from the 1800's, Mr. Stealthboxxer."<br/>
<br/>
"To be quite frank I don't even know who it is I am looking for<br/>
really.  I just have some scant information about a ship and I have<br/>
run into a conundrum of sorts here.  Seems the ship I am looking into<br/>
has or had a sister ghost ship from the past with the same name.  I<br/>
don't know if that means anything or not but as long as I am here I<br/>
think I should at least look into it for my client's sake."<br/>
<br/>
"All right.  I don't mean to pry.  Follow me and I will show you the<br/>
archives."  She led me down a hallway behind the counter to a small<br/>
dark room with no windows that had a dank musty smell.  It was filled<br/>
to the ceiling with rows and rows of bookcases.  The area where the<br/>
shipping records were housed were labeled according to year and we<br/>
soon found the records for the early to mid 1890's back to the 1840's.<br/>
 This section comprised most of one bookcase. She left me alone to<br/>
investigate on my own and soon I had pulled shipping records for all<br/>
the shipments on the Escalate in its first 2 years and last 3 years of<br/>
shipping in and out of Olympia.  <br/>
<br/>
I noticed the pattern right away.  Each shipment out of Olympia<br/>
contained at least one piece of freight from an R.J.Geraldson Company<br/>
headed to Alaska.  Could this be the same Geraldson that was currently<br/>
shipping mining equipment to Alaska?  It was too coincidental to be a<br/>
fluke.  I made some notes and then put the files away and walked back<br/>
to the desk again.<br/>
<br/>
"I appreciate your help miss.  I was wondering if you could help me<br/>
with one more thing.  I would like to know if the library would have a<br/>
record of companies that have done business through the port<br/>
throughout the years."<br/>
<br/>
"The library has many books that document the shipping companies and<br/>
ships that frequent the port.  There is also a catalog of companies<br/>
who ship through our port as well.  If you can give me the names I can<br/>
do the search for you."<br/>
<br/>
"Alright.  I'd like to have information on the Dravus Limited company<br/>
of Glasgow, Scotland.  It is the owner of a ship named Escalate which<br/>
I have found to have visited the port several times over the last 10<br/>
years.  I would also like to see what you may have on the Geraldson<br/>
Corporation of Denver, Colorado.  This company has shipped several<br/>
shipments of mining equipment aboard the Escalate in the last 10 years."<br/>
<br/>
"OK, I will see what we have.  I am sure I can do this much faster by<br/>
myself.  If you would like you can have a seat while I pull the<br/>
records for you.  It should only take a few minutes.  There is a<br/>
coffeepot in the staff room there behind that door.  Feel free to have<br/>
a cup."<br/>
<br/>
"Thanks."  I got myself a cup of Joe and sat at the desk and thumbed<br/>
through a copy of Life magazine while I waited.  The librarian<br/>
returned in a few minutes with 4 books.  <br/>
<br/>
"You know, I found quite a lot of information on both of those<br/>
companies you were interested in, Mr. Letterboxxer.  It looks like<br/>
both of those companies are quite old and have been doing business<br/>
together through our port for over 90 years."<br/>
<br/>
"That's what my research into the harbormaster records indicated. Can<br/>
you show me any information on the owners of the companies and any<br/>
links that they may have as far as board members."<br/>
<br/>
"Funny you should ask that.  It seams that the original owner of the<br/>
Geraldson company, Mr. Randolph Johnson Geraldson was a board member<br/>
of Dravus Limited.  It says here that Mr. Geraldson was from Wales and<br/>
immigrated to the U.S. in the mid 1830's.  He ended up in the Denver<br/>
area and started several mines, silver and copper for the most part.<br/>
In 1845 he financed a mining expedition to California and his company<br/>
eventually opened one of the richest gold mines in the territory.<br/>
Later in the 1890's when gold was discovered in Alaska his company was<br/>
one of the largest mining companies in that territory as well."<br/>
<br/>
"My own research showed that the old Escalate was carrying mining<br/>
equipment to Alaska from the Olympia port as early as 1847.  If this<br/>
is correct, it would seem that our mysterious Mr. Geraldson was ahead<br/>
of both of the largest gold rushes in our nation's history.  That<br/>
would make Mr. Geraldson a very important and powerful man."<br/>
<br/>
"It would seem so. Later records show that Geraldson's son, grandson<br/>
and great-grandson eventually ended up as head of the company after<br/>
R.J. passed on."  She turned to another page in the book and pointed<br/>
out a list of company officers, "Interestingly too, each Geraldson<br/>
also served on the board of directors for Dravus Limited in his time.<br/>
Currently the head of the Geraldson Corporation is Robert Johnson<br/>
Geraldson, great grandson of Randolph Johnson Geraldson."<br/>
<br/>
"That's quite a dynasty the Geraldsons have. I wonder why I have never<br/>
heard of them until today." <br/>
<br/>
"I don't know. I would think that a company that big and a family that<br/>
rich would have been world famous."<br/>
<br/>
"Do the books show any other companies that Geraldson owns?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes. This shows that Geraldson owns a whole gamut of different<br/>
companies all over the globe. Most are in the mining business in some<br/>
way but others are listed as being involved in oil exploration,<br/>
newspaper publishing, logging, the rubber trade, and munitions."<br/>
<br/>
"Are any of these companies located in this area?"<br/>
<br/>
"As a matter of fact, there was a logging company named the McCaw<br/>
Logging Company that was owned by Geraldson listed as being opened in<br/>
1895 and headquartered in the town of Bordeaux which is about 15 miles<br/>
south of Tumwater. It shows that they had an office in Olympia too.<br/>
However, the record shows that the company closed back in 1927. There<br/>
is also a record of another company that was based in Portland, Oregon<br/>
that Geraldson owned. It was a land development and construction<br/>
company called the DeAmour Company. It shows that the company was<br/>
opened in 1840 by Peter DeAmour and was purchased by Geraldson in<br/>
1850. That company also closed in 1927."<br/>
<br/>
"The name of McCaw keeps coming up in my investigation. What<br/>
information do you have on company officers for the McCaw Logging<br/>
Company?"<br/>
<br/>
"The book lists the President of the company as one Sam McCaw."<br/>
<br/>
"As I suspected. Too bad the McCaw Company closed in '27. I wouldn't<br/>
mind paying them a visit and asking some questions."<br/>
<br/>
"Well, you may not be too late.  I show that the office that they<br/>
operated has the same address as the current Geraldson Corporation's<br/>
regional office."<br/>
<br/>
"Why didn't you tell me Geraldson had an office in Olympia?"<br/>
<br/>
"You didn't ask."<br/>
<br/>
I took down the address of the current Geraldson office and made some<br/>
notes on the names of the companies and their officers and their dates<br/>
of operations. I asked Laurel, that's the librarian's name, to copy<br/>
all the information she could find for me and left her ten dollars for<br/>
her trouble and told her I would be back on Monday to pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
I had uncovered some mysteries but it seemed I was at least getting<br/>
somewhere. The problem was, I just didn't know what it had to do with<br/>
the case.<br/>
