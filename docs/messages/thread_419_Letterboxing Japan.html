 I am journeying into the wild of Japan next month. I was wondering if anybody knows of any boxes. So far google has turned up zilch. Please let me know :-) . . . if there aren't any there (or even if there are) I might have to leave a few 'surprises' behind. . . knowing Funhog, that would inspire  her to go on a business trip there. She'd only have to ask her boss to pay for it.<br/>
