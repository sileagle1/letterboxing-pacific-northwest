Hi,<br/>
My husband and I are headed to the Seattle/Tacoma area the weekend <br/>
of the 19th and were wondering if there are good boxes to find for a <br/>
family with a 4 yrold and 20 mon old. We can't hike really far, but <br/>
we can do some hiking. We are going out there for the international <br/>
Bike show. My husband the mountain biker. He can't laugh at me over <br/>
my Obssesion.<br/>

Run a search of the area in which you're interested on <br/>
www.AtlasQuest.com as most clues there are rated by hike length.  <br/>
Also, any boxes we've planted (dvn2r ckr, rnrB &amp; trkr) were planted <br/>
with at least an 8 month old to a 6 year old along for the ride <br/>
(although a few are longer hikes--we usually mention something about <br/>
the length of the longer hikes in the clues--unless they're mystery <br/>
boxes then it's just a grab bag).<br/>
<br/>
Any idea what part of Seattle you'll be in?  That'll help narrow <br/>
down the scope of your hunt quite a bit.  Seattle/Tacoma/Olympia is <br/>
a great spot for 'power'boxing but it's an even better region to see <br/>
some of the most beautiful sites on Earth--although some aren't <br/>
as 'box-laden' as others.  If you have a particular preference in <br/>
mind, let us know.  Also, there are some incredible playgrounds in <br/>
the region--not too far from letterboxes so that's always something <br/>
that works out rather well with kids in tow (St Edwards State Park <br/>
in Kirkland comes to mind which is home to a bunch of boxes but a <br/>
little longer hikes).<br/>
<br/>
If you're in downtown Seattle--I'd lean toward any 'West Seattle' <br/>
boxes as they offer great views, that 'Seattle' feel since you're in <br/>
view of the Seattle skyline and Puget Sound shipping activity and <br/>
short 'spurts' of walking in many cases.  There are a bunch of great <br/>
letterboxes in the Bellevue/Redmond/Issaquah area but some regions <br/>
(suburban streets) are difficult to navigate if you don't have much <br/>
time to get to know the area.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure of any boxes still 'alive' in downtown Seattle proper but <br/>
there are a couple that aren't terribly far from downtown.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip!!!  We'd offer to show you around but we'll most <br/>
likely be out of town (planned trip to CA) when you're in Seattle.  <br/>
Perhaps next time you're in the area?<br/>

I will be out of town that weekend too! Be sure to check out the<br/>
Flagship REI letterbox in downtown. Carkeek Park also has a great<br/>
playground for kids and it has at least 4 letterboxes that are still<br/>
alive and well. <br/>
<br/>
Turkey Dinner has a kids playground at the beginning of the hike and<br/>
so does Twin Ponds. <br/>
<br/>
And both West Seattle parks (Schmitz and Lincoln) have playgrounds<br/>
too! The West Seattle letterboxes also let you get down to the Beach<br/>
and play  around the rocks and driftwood. --Watch the ferryboats<br/>
heading out to Bainbridge or Vashon Island. Especially nice on a sunny<br/>
day like today (Tuesday 2/8).<br/>
