<br/>
Your email address keeps kicking back.  Your Hiker on the Hill is doing fine - warm and safe <br/>
and dry as of 3/14/06.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for poaching your park, but I had limited time in Spokane and desperately needed <br/>
to plant another west coast box.  Stay tuned for clues.<br/>
<br/>
BTW  Pennsylvania Postcard 3 (which had been reported missing in Spokane) is alive and well.  <br/>
Sometimes, you need to poke around in the leaves a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
All the best to my Washington State Letterboxing brothers and sisters<br/>
