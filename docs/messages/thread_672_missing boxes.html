<br>
The culprit is the park ranger. I think my Buxton box - which I <br>
recently replaced - went missing somehow other than the ranger (it's <br>
kinda precarious under that bridge) which explains him not being <br>
able to get the rest of my boxes since that box was the only place <br>
to get the clues. He could still find the Fallen Feather box since <br>
he knew where my box was supposed to be. He had access to <br>
Windairen's Wild Rose clues but no knowledge where to start, so hers <br>
was safe. <br>

"caught" by the ranger. The ranger reportedly told him<br>
that letterboxing wasn't allowed in state parks but<br>
he'd probably leave the boxes as long as no damage was<br>
occuring. He reportedly noted that he had pulled<br>
geocaches due to damage. I'm afraid that he might not<br>
be cooperative. I'm thinking of pulling the clues and<br>
filing on the LBPNW files section like Funhog's new<br>
box. Or perhaps I'll retire the boxes altogether.<br>

I can assure you, that Zara and I have found every letterbox that we <br>
have searched for in B.C., and Washington. (Not necessarily the first <br>
time!) We found a wealth of boxes in Victoria two years ago, and are <br>
anxious to claim the new boxes that have been planted there. This <br>
time, we are also going to drive to Nanaimo. And, no doubt we'll find <br>
boxes there as well. B.C. boxes are not missing!  <br>

CSB,<br>
thanks for encouraging us.<br>
well, I see that you found those boxes in October I believe, and I DO<br>
hope they are still there.<br>
Our own box we planted is definitely missing!,<br>
The Secret Gardenres obviously put a lot of work into their stamps and<br>
plants,<br>
so I do hope they are still there.<br>
so I guess I was wrong is saying they are 'missing'..but we did<br>
thoroughly check.<br>
We know for sure we found the <br>
'cow' and 'turkey leg' location, but dug and scrounged and really felt<br>
like we were tearing up the ground,<br>
we did put it all back,<br>
but I 'hate' having to mess with the environment like that.<br>
On the Turkey Leg we found the spot, pretty well for sure where there<br>
had been some debris used to cover up the stamp/box, but came up dry.<br>
Oh I do hope they are all still there,<br>
has anyone else found these sereis since last October????<br>
Houston Trail Series #2<br>
or Turkey Parts?<br>
<br>
there were a couple of other ones where I was positive we found the<br>
right spot.<br>
<br>
They were a part of the Gathering, and I do so hope they are still there.<br>
so sorry for calling them 'missing' if they are not.<br>
<br>

I am so sorry again, <br>
I do need to be more careful with my words.<br>
<br>
<br>
we do not want to give up. I know this is a worthwhile venture.<br>
<br>
Funhog you are right, that the fall foliage is considerably different,<br>
trilliums and bleeding hearts  are 'just not there' in the fall, so I<br>
do know that is what happened.<br>
So live and learn<br>
I guess as we are going along perhaps when I see where a spot is 'to<br>
be' and there is growth then we should just leave it. We didnt 'tear<br>
up' , as I try to be most cautious and sensitive to the environment.<br>
However, we can only hope that others too will be 'thoughtful'.<br>
So great advice Funhog, yup we will have to pass up on some if that is<br>
the case. I guess in our Pacific (N?W to you all S/W to us in Canada),<br>
climate it is a given that foliage will be vastly different from fall<br>
to spring and summer.<br>
<br>
Now I have had my hand slapped twice here,we are just trying to enjoy<br>
this sport. We were so happy to find some wonderful letterboxes<br>
before. Thaks CSB...Hope to get out soon again. The weather has been<br>
terrific, but my dd is in a show and now she is in rehearsals every<br>
day for the next bit. Alas, after May 14th should be better. We DO<br>
want to find some.<br>
so please be patient with us a we have our trilas.<br>
I know I have always been a bit of a clutz with words..and it has<br>
gotten me in trouble<br>
so the boxes in BC are not missing and 'hate' was the wrong word to use.<br>
sorry...<br>

try I quit looking due to a hail storm!!  But when I found it, it was <br>
right where I had been looking the first time.  The nearest I can <br>
figure was that there had been more blackberry trimmings and I didn't <br>
get through the stickers all the way to the bottom where the box was.  <br>
Or I was just being too literal and didn't look thoroughly...  The <br>
moral of this story; I knew I had the right spot! I was sure that box <br>
was missing. If at first you don't succeed...  PS  2 years have passed <br>
since I first tried for that box.  Time and experience have maybe <br>
changed my perspective to where it needed to be?<br>
