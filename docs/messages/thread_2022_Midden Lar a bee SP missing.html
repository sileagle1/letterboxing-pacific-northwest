I received word that my "Midden" box at Lar a bee SP near B'ham WA is <br/>
missing.  I have not confirmed, but the person reporting gave the <br/>
exact location of the box in her e mail.<br/>
<br/>
Darn if for sure, it was one of my best stamps and I was right chuffed <br/>
about the clue.<br/>

I'm sorry to hear that Midden is missing!  The stamp was very well <br/>
done...I'm glad I had a chance to see it.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace and Happiness,<br/>
