is very cool BTW and the place to sit and stamp in is<br>
gorgeous and peaceful) we noticed a LBer stamp that<br>
we've not seen in say, almost 2 years.  I was shocked.<br>
 The stamp wasn't signed nor dated but this box isn't<br>
that new and this duo dropped out of the hobby before<br>
this box was planted.<br>
<br>
So, long story short - WELCOME BACK if you're out<br>
there - you know who you are!  It was GREAT to see you<br>
stamping in again!!!<br>
