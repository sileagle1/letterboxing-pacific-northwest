My trip to Vancouver-Banff-Jasper now over I am pleased to report it <br>
was great fun and had the added bonus of LetterBoxing.<br>
<br>
While in Vancouver I caught the SeaBus to North Vancouver and the <br>
city bus to Lynn Canyon.  I asked the driver to let me know when we <br>
got to the corner of 'this and that'.  The next lady boarding the bus <br>
was wanting the same guidance.  So we started chatting and as we left <br>
the Park's environmental center I clued her in on what I was really <br>
doing there.  Mimi was on an 8 day visit from Japan and took great <br>
interest in the activity.  We found both boxes (Ryan's and Amanda's) <br>
and she took the temporary trail name of "Visiting Sun".  It was <br>
great having someone to hike with.<br>
<br>
The day was slipping away so I had to hurry back to Stanley Park to <br>
find a box I couldn't find (clues had been emailed to me, not on <br>
LB.org) so I set out to plant two boxes (I still need to post those <br>
clues).  I also planted a box in Banff and in Jasper.<br>
<br>
It was a great trip and beautiful country.<br>
