as part of North Central Oregon on the LbNA site. This ends up with<br>
boxes around Cascade Locks being listed alongside those in Bend,<br>
Prineville, etc. Since much of this county is part of the Columbia<br>
River Gorge and is readily accessible to Portland via I-84, it seems<br>
to me that it should be listed as part of the Portland Area page. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Seems a little wierd to me too. Maybe it should be organized more <br>
like the Oregon Tourism folks do it:<br>
<br>
The Coast  <br>
Portland  <br>
Mt. Hood & The Gorge  <br>
Willamette Valley  <br>
Southern Oregon  <br>
Central Oregon  <br>
Eastern Oregon <br>
<br>
But I think the letterbox site has to go by county boundary and <br>
Multnomah county messes things up since it is both Portland and <br>
Gorge.<br>
<br>
So maybe we could have:<br>
<br>
Coast (might be nice to split into North and South)<br>
Portland/Gorge/Mt Hood<br>
Willamette Valley<br>
Central<br>
Southern<br>
Eastern<br>
<br>

looking things up, but....  Growing up in that specific area....  I <br>
know how confusing it could be.  making new boundries like bcostly <br>
and someone else mentioned is a great idea... N & S costal, valley, <br>
central, Gorge, etc.....  Just my 2 cents if it isn't too much <br>
trouble I think more would be found this way.....  Thanks for the <br>
quick lurking reply Wes!  Wingnut<br>
