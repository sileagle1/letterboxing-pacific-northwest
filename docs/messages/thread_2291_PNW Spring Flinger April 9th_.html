Millersylvania has a bunch of boxes placed in it for FF2 - Booooogie in <br/>
the Park last year. Not sure how many are left or what the status of <br/>
them is (There was even a HH Hostel there), but as we were the ones that <br/>
hosted that event, I'll say this much, we simply LOVED Millersylvania <br/>
SP, it was so easy to get to, it was very nice and the staff was <br/>
exceptional.  The covered pavilion was in good shape and there was more <br/>
space than we could shake a stick at.<br/>

Other potential venues might be Wildwood Park in Puyallup (lots of <br/>

Defiance Park in Tacoma.  Wildwood has never hosted a gathering yet <br/>

year I instantly thought "great spot for a gathering" but simply ran <br/>

I can't remember much about Priest Point Park (expect where those <br/>

small covered pavillions there, too, over by the water.  By the way, <br/>
you can grab a great Thanksgiving meal there, too, if you're keen <br/>
(that is, if it's still available this time of year).<br/>
<br/>
Pt D has great pavillions but it's dark in the winter/spring with so <br/>
many trees and I'm not sure how many letterboxes in the park are <br/>
still in the running.  Many haven't seemed to last more than a few <br/>
years or so as the trail maintainers are quite fastidious about <br/>
patrolling the trails.<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep thinking of potential locations around the area.<br/>

I'd love to say bye to Bethany and her great family before they leave also.  <br/>
So, the East Coast is getting a goodie....Hmmmm....I don't know where Bethany is moving to but TeamWARE is leaving TOO!!!!  (Okay, okay, hold down the cheers! You, yeah you over there in the corner - you can stop jumping for joy now.....really). HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA<br/>
We are leaving and moving back to Knoxville, TN on July 2, 2005.  Boxing hasn't grabbed hold in Knoxville - not yet - and I'm excited to get back there.  However, my heart will break to leave my volcanos and waterfalls behind.  And I will surely miss being able to go into the woods and not fear the snakes.  The same is not true in the Smokey Mtns.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, please keep everyone abreast of the event details.  I've blocked out that day on my calendar and I would also vote for the event being on the south side of Seattle.  I'm a Vancouver gal and would also like to see the Oregon folks be able to attend with ease.  There's so many boxers in Oregon that it would be a shame if they were not able to make it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for thinking of Bethany and her wonderful family.  The East Coast is getting a goodie but she sure did leave some splendor here in the PacNW.<br/>

Hey Steve -<br/>
The HISS letterbox is confirmed safe and sound and dry according to an October boxer who found it and made sure it wasn't left in the wide open.  I've always wanted to go to that park.....I'd vote for Millersylvania too.<br/>

&gt; Millersylvania has a bunch of boxes placed in it for FF2 - Booooogie <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the Park last year. Not sure how many are left or what the status of <br/>
&gt; them is (There was even a HH Hostel there), but as we were the ones <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; hosted that event, I'll say this much, we simply LOVED Millersylvania <br/>
&gt; SP, it was so easy to get to, it was very nice and the staff was <br/>
&gt; exceptional.  The covered pavilion was in good shape and there was <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; space than we could shake a stick at.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One concern with Millersylvania in the Winter/early Spring is that <br/>
apart from the dry Summer season around here the trails there quickly <br/>
become a muddy, mucky mess.  We've glopped along on some of the trails <br/>
in mud at least a foot deep--in April.  It wouldn't be a problem if it <br/>
were just a couple of the trails but a couple of the more 'critical' <br/>
trails seem to be right around the level of the water table in these <br/>
parts and they turn into mush (the ground seems to liquefy sort of like <br/>
Boeing Field or Tolmie SP do during earthquakes).  <br/>
