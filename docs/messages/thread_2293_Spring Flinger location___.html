Thanks so much for the input.  Yes, I do want it in a more southern <br>
place to enable some of the great boxers from Oregon to come.  Priest <br>
Point is about half the size of Millersylvania, plus Mill. has camping <br>
and RV spots.  The place is flipping huge.  There is also a cute <br>
lakeside cottage that they rent out there. <br>
Wildwood is a good place to letterbox, but my vote wouldn't be for a <br>
gathering.  On the weekends it can get real busy...hard to box when <br>
you have to wait for an all clear.  Additionally, the parking can be a <br>
hassle.  Also, it can get busy during the week around lunch, as <br>
several daycares BUS kids there for an outing.  I loved when they were <br>
repaving the road, because we would park on the road and walk down, <br>
and have the place to ourselves, HE HE!<br>
I will devote more brainspace to it after our Thanksgiving trip, and <br>
I'll keep ya'll posted!<br>
Thanks again! Elisabeth/Buppsters<br>
