Washington.<br>
<br>
I have carved a new stamp and replaced the original journal as of November 18, 2006. <br>
Weatherwatch is active and ready for visitors.<br>
<br>
This postage stamp sized park has recently had much of its vegetation removed by the Park <br>
Department. The letterbox is a bit more exposed than it was. If you visit, please re-hide <br>
carefully. But then that pretty much applies to each and every letterbox, now doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Happy letterboxing.<br>
