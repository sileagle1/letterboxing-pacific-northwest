                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm here to third the opinion of geocaching hybrids. Those letterbox stamps have a <br/>
bad habit of taking a hike when combined with a geocache. As for the silicone wipes, <br/>
if they have a scent they may be an attractive nuisance for an animal with a good <br/>
sniffer. They are probably hermetically sealed but you never know. I'd hate for your <br/>
box to be ravaged by a wild beast.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's dogs on the trail... being a birdwatcher, I'm not particularly fond of <br/>
meeting them on the trail. Dogs tend to frighten any wildlife anywhere nearby. It <br/>
totally drives me crazy when they are running loose in an area where leashes are <br/>
required. I also raise my eyebrows at the account of washing feces off in a local <br/>
stream. Can you say, "e. coli???" I've been trying to keep my mouth shut on this but <br/>
the Curmudgeon won out. When camping, you are always supposed to make your <br/>
latrine at least 300' from a water source. Why is a dog any different? Watersheds <br/>
receive so much negative pressure from human impact that this is just one more way <br/>
to pollute this precious resource.<br/>
<br/>
That's my Eco-Rant for the day. I'm off to the Zoo. Funhog<br/>
