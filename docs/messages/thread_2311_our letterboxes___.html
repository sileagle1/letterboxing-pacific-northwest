Sorry for the inconvenience.  :(<br/>

*hehe* Evil Glenn e-mailed me earlier today saying how mean it was of<br/>
me to ban him from seeing clues on AQ before he's even had a chance to<br/>
do anything wrong. =) I didn't know whose clues he was talking about,<br/>
but said I wouldn't ban him from clues. Perhaps the message boards at<br/>
times, but I certainly wouldn't ban him from clues! Now I realize it<br/>
must have been one of your clues he was trying to access.<br/>
<br/>
Sheeze, get me in trouble for something I didn't do. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I've changed my little "AtlasQuest Bot" to stop crawling the boxes on<br/>
AQ that you own, though, so the cached versions are still available<br/>
there for anyone that really, really needs to get a clue! Just click<br/>
to see the clue like you usually do, but when you get the error<br/>
message, there's a link at the top of the page called "Cached Clue"<br/>
that will get you the clue. It's not pretty, but it's better than nothing!<br/>
