Cascade Locks, Hood River County, Oregon. <br>
<br>
In December 1884 a westbound train headed for Portland rounded a bend<br>
and plowed into a twenty five foot wall of snow. Passengers were paid<br>
$3 per day to shovel snow and local residents from Hood River and<br>
Cascade Locks skied in with food and other supplies. No one starved<br>
during the nearly three week stranding but the name Starvation Creek<br>
stuck. Hopefully, you won't go hungry on this hike. The 2.5 mile loop<br>
is steep in places with lots of ups and downs. Good shoes will help a<br>
lot with the loose dirt and gravel.<br>
<br>
To the trailhead: Take I-84 about ten miles east of Cascade Locks to<br>
exit 55, Starvation Creek Trailhead. Park here and walk back towards<br>
the Wrong Way/Do Not Enter signs for the off ramp. The trail heads<br>
west along the freeway.<br>
<br>
To the letterboxes: In about a quarter mile you will reach a trail<br>
junction. Go left, up, up, up. Go right at the next junction. Right<br>
after the first creek crossing, you will see a triple trunked tree and<br>
a fallen log. Where the vertical meets the horizontal the first<br>
letterbox is hidden behind rock and wood.<br>
<br>
Continue on the trail across the second creek. Just after rounding the<br>
next switchback you will see a small side trail on the left. Go up<br>
about ten steps and you will find the second letterbox on your left<br>
behind bark and stone. <br>
<br>
Head on down the main trail, keeping right at the next junction. At<br>
Hole-in-the-Wall Falls you will cross a wooden footbridge. Continue on<br>
the trail watching for a mossy boulder on your left. The third<br>
letterbox is nestled underneath hidden behind a loose rock. Your car<br>
is parked a short distance ahead.<br>
