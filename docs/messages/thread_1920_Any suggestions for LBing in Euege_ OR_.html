Not sure from where you're starting but Shan's Christmas box isn't <br>
too difficult/time consuming.  It's at Valley of Rogue SP just South <br>
of Grants Pass.  Otherwise, not too sure about other 'quick' boxes <br>
along that stretch.  Try a trip planner search on www.atlasquest.com <br>
It may help a little?<br>
