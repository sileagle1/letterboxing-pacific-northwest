I visited Candlelights blizzard at Discovery Park today.  Instead of <br/>
printing out the pictures I viewed them and wrote a narration.  It <br/>
worked great!<br/>
<br/>
I also paid a visit to the West Point Mule.  A great stamp!  There <br/>
was an old friend The 'Travaling' HH started by the Nail Family at <br/>
the South Puget Sound Quest Fest.  This is the second time I gave a <br/>
ride.  It appears Candlelight picked him up at St Edwards SP where I <br/>
left him.<br/>
<br/>
I took him on to another venue.<br/>
