Alafair and delivered by Patricius to the Pack 211 Webelos II last <br>
January.  The box was placed at Kennedy Falls which is about 1 mile <br>
upstream of the Kennedy Creek Salmon Trail park.  The letterbox is <br>
just for the cub scouts of Pack 211 and the clues will not be <br>
posted.  This year's Webelos have a day hike planned for next <br>
weekend and plan to find all the letterboxes at Kennedy Creek as <br>
well as the special box we hid today.<br>
<br>
I wanted to let you Fudrick, dvn2rckr, T n E, EG, and Hoopoe know <br>
about this so I could say thank you again for placing the <br>
letterboxes at Kennedy Creek.  We checked on a few of them and all 4 <br>
that we looked at were in fine shape despite the large numbers of <br>
visitors to the park today.  The chum salmon are running full force <br>
right now and there are interpreters at several view points around <br>
the park giving information on the spawn.  One person is stationed <br>
right next to a letterbox--  I had to distract him with some salmon <br>
questions while EJN and the G-Man grabbed T & E's box that eluded us <br>
the last time we were there.  It is the perfect time to get out and <br>
see the salmon and pick up some very nice stamps too!  <br>
<br>
Incidently, we signed up for the new Postal Scout Letterbox and when <br>
we recieve it, we plan to have it visit the Kennedy Falls Scout <br>
Letterbox.  Since this is such a very nice area (with a 4 mile round <br>
trip hike opportunity to get to the falls) we plan to place a box at <br>
the falls for the general letterboxing community.  Keep watching for <br>
the new box to be placed ???<br>
