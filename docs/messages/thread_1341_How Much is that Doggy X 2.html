of Childhood Series.   We even ran into Campfire Lady, with daughter Cat's <br/>
Meow and momma Purple Iris, stamping in at one of the boxes.   <br/>
<br/>
But here's the odd thing: How Much is that Doggy in the Window is now TWO <br/>
letterboxes rather than one.   Heather and I found one (whose stamp looked <br/>
store-bought/did not match Pandora's style/carving skill--and sure enough, Campfire <br/>
Lady, et al, found the original box!   Apparently someone was convinced the <br/>
doggy was missing and made a replacement (but hid it in the wrong place, <br/>
incidently).<br/>
<br/>
Curious, huh?<br/>
