We find it's easier to place than to hunt boxes because of the danger of<br/>

I like indoor boxes.<br/>

Well now days...we do when it's conveniently located near an ice rink <br/>
in the greater Puget Sound Area. Letterboxing takes a backseat when <br/>
you have two kids that play ice hockey from August til March. We do <br/>
alot of boxing and geochaching in the spring when camping at <br/>
Millersylvania and near the ocean. Yes...I said the "g" word in a <br/>
letterboxing group and admit to participating in it.<br/>
<br/>
I actually prefer letterboxing in the winter around here. Less people <br/>
on the trails and the dogs always enjoy a reason to play in the mud! <br/>
Half the time we don't get wet because we are on wooded trails.  <br/>
MomNoTime and myself have a tradition of letterboxing on New Year's <br/>
Day too...it was spawned the year we had snow on New Years Day a few <br/>
years back.<br/>
