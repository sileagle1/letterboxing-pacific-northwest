letterboxing seems to get the nod more often than others (except<br>

What are your hobbies/interests besides letterboxing?  I used to list<br>
gardening when asked that question, but I went out in my yard today<br>

Um, yeessss, I would agree that not having a smelly mess and fish<br>
carcasses to deal with is definitely a plus.  YUCK!<br>

Travel, travel, & more travel (next in the queue--Korea, Thailand, <br>
Vietnam & Cambodia)--perpetual motion?  <br>
<br>
Running, triathlon, kickboxing, yoga; health & fitness anything--<br>
perpetual motion?<br>
<br>
Cooking (Cooks Illustrated rocks!), organizing, gardening, frugal <br>
(hooked on Tightwad Gazzette-type stuff so we can save $ for <br>
travel)/debt free living (Dave Ramsey Financial Peace beans, rice & <br>
kool-aid drinker), thrift shop treasure hunting, professional <br>
polished glass collector and amateur Puget Sound beach rockhounder; <br>
old home renovator, architecture junkie--perpetual motion?<br>
<br>
Once I turned off the TV about 4 years ago (hmmm--that corresponds <br>
to about when we started letterboxing--I realized I was wasting TOO <br>
MUCH time keeping up with who got kicked off the island each season) <br>
I started reading again.  Voraciously! Currently reading through the <br>
classics in sequential order as outlined in The Well-Educated Mind--<br>
since Nov 04, I've completed Don Quixote, The Pilgrim's Progress, <br>
Gulliver's Travels, Pride & Prejudice, Oliver Twist, Sense & <br>
Sensibility and halfway through Jane Eyre.  Slowly but surely.  ;)  <br>
About 2,000 more novels, biographies, annotated histories, dramas <br>
and poetry selections to go.  I think I'm keeping my local indie-<br>
used book store in business--perpetual motion?<br>
<br>
Crunching numbers!!! Love it--almost as much as letterboxing!  I'm a <br>
finance junkie! Perpetual motion?<br>
<br>
Homeschooling 2 children via Classical Curriculum (The Well-Trained <br>
Mind route)--hence the voracious reading addiction as I've got to <br>
stay 2 steps ahead of their curriculum.  ;)  Perpetual motion!<br>
<br>
Eventually working toward medical school, although I may be a <br>
grandparent by then at this rate--someday, after some sleep.  ;)<br>
<br>
Perpetual nomad thanks to our dear Uncle Sam...<br>

Quilting (it's just about all I do) and astrology (been doing  charts for 20+ <br>
years). Odd combination, I know. I need to realize that I'm just  not that <br>
normal!<br>

Hiking with our dog Peaches and photography which explains why as an<br>
additional outdoor activity letterboxing is a perfect addition.  We<br>
also love kayaking. Have yet to plant or find a box that incorporates<br>
kayaking but it is in the planning stage.<br>
<br>
I also went "cold turkey" from watching TV 6 yrs. ago and am amazed<br>
how much else can be accomplished in the evening time. Reading, games,<br>
puzzles, baking and good old fashioned conversation.<br>
<br>
Always trying to maintain a balance of work/play, indoor/outdoor,<br>
physical/relaxation and make all of it fun.  <br>

Bethany, I'm reading Jane Eyre right now too - have the same idea, to<br>
re-read some of the books they made us read in high school.  That's<br>
why they're called classics, because they are GOOD books and timeless.<br>
 I remember once one of my high school literature teachers told our<br>
class if anybody wanted to tackle Anna Karenina in lieu of the other<br>
course work, she would give an A for that class - I read it and got<br>
the A, but can't remember the book now almost 40 years later, so it's<br>
on my list too.  And I want to say your list of activities makes me<br>
want to take ANOTHER nap.  whew!<br>

picture), and whippet racing.  I also love to travel, but haven't had <br>
the time or money to do much lately.  Letterboxing allows me to <br>
travel locally and sharpen my puzzle skills, so I at least get to <br>
combine a few of my loves together.<br>
<br>
I'm not as good as dvn2ckr on reading classics.  I love mysteries and <br>
romance & sci-fi.  I always have a huge "to-read" list.  My "read it" <br>
list is a little shorter, but I do usually end up reading between 8 <br>
and 10 books a month.  Anyone that wants to talk books, send me an <br>
email!<br>
<br>
If any of you happen to be boxing with me when I have my dogs along, <br>
Carmen & Sophie (known in letterboxing log books as the "Wonder <br>
Whippets") have their own special stamps to share.  And, if you are <br>
really lucky, they will be happy to walk all over your log book and <br>
leave foot prints on it for you.  Mud is their preferred medium, but <br>
ink will work in a pinch. :-)<br>
<br>
Oh, and if any of you ever make it to my house, I have a permanant <br>
hitch hiker living with me.  She'll stamp your book too, but you have <br>
to come visit and bring her kitty greenie treats! Cleo is a true <br>
hitchhiker since I found her sitting on the rock the box I was <br>
hunting was hiding under.  She doesn't move around much though!<br>

lot of basketball, softball and flag football, but I'm finding it hard to <br>
keep up with the younguns now. I also sing with a men's chorus and with my <br>
church choir.<br>

I forgot a couple more... Su doku, Scrabble and photography.  ;)  Su <br>
doku helps me while away the time while I wait for rnrB's 2-hour <br>
ballet/jazz/tap class twice a week.  I love Scrabble but haven't had <br>
many opportunities to play the past 2 years (read none--as rnrB's just <br>
starting to spell multi-syllabic words, trkr still has a way to go with <br>
phonics before he'd even consider playing and Trkee's been 5,200 miles <br>
away).  It's usually what Trkee considers akin to torture!  Photography <br>
is a given when we're out letterboxing.  I never leave home without my <br>
camera or binocular in tow.<br>
<br>
Yes, turning off the TV was one of the best things we've ever done.  <br>
It's amazing how much time we were wasting just 'sitting there'.<br>

<br>
Piper and I like to do contra dancing, which is a type of American folk dancing, done to <br>
Irish-Scots fiddle music. It bears some resemblence to square dancing, but is much more <br>
informal (no special outfits) and you dance with everyone in a long line of people. If <br>
anyone has seen or done the Virginia Reel, it's like that. We also do English Country <br>
dancing, which you've seen if you've ever seen a Jane Austen movie such as Pride and <br>
Prjudice. And the mild-mannered piper plays bagpipes, of course.<br>
<br>
 I love to read, fantasy, science fiction, old-fashioned British mysteries, and history, but <br>
my to-read pile is bigger than my done-reading pile;) Last book was Wee Free Men by <br>
Terry Pratchett, which was charming.<br>
<br>
The kids like video games, super-hero movies and comic books (Spider-Man is a <br>
favourite), baseball, and generally causing mayhem.<br>
