&gt; Ok--now for one of my favorite parts of 'post-letterboxing' get-<br/>
&gt; togethers (cooking is one of my other hobbies or, dare I say, <br/>
&gt; passions?)...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm looking for the recipe for the marshmallowy-jello-dream whip <br/>
&gt; fruit salady dish.  I know it's one of those ambrosia type recipes <br/>
&gt; but WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THAT SPECIFIC DISH?  I loved it!!!  I'm not <br/>
&gt; a coconut/walnut person so that specific one was really MY kind of <br/>
&gt; ambrosia!  ;)  Please, whoever brought this dish, post the recipe <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; the board or email me off-line.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please post the potato salad recipes, too!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Myriad kudos to Team Rayvenhaus for such awesome hamburgers &amp; <br/>
&gt; hotdogs &amp; Hoopoe for her awesome deli-buster sandwich!!!  I'm not <br/>
&gt; sure who brought the other dishes so I apologize for not thanking <br/>
&gt; you for your incredible dishes--thank you en masse!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mmmm...mmmm,<br/>

&gt; Spinach Artichoke Dip<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1 (14oz) can of Artichoke Hearts, drained &amp; chopped <br/>
&gt; (I used the packed in water artichokes not marinated in olive oil--<br/>
&gt; but you can use either type)<br/>
&gt; 3/4 cup mayonnaise (I used Best Foods/Hellman's type)<br/>
&gt; 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (I used parmesan reggiano from <br/>
Costco-<br/>
&gt; -I grated it right before I cooked it)<br/>
&gt; 1 teaspoon lemon juice <br/>
&gt; dash garlic powder (I used garlic salt--would've used fresh garlic <br/>
&gt; if I had some on hand--that's life after being on vacation for <br/>
&gt; several weeks!)<br/>
&gt; about 6 dashes of Tabasco sauce<br/>
&gt; about 1-1/2 cup of chopped fresh spinach (about 1/2 inch square <br/>
&gt; pieces)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Preheat oven to 350*.  Mix all of the ingredients (you can mash the <br/>
&gt; artichoke hearts with a fork if you like) and spread in a baking <br/>
&gt; dish.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until thoroughly heated.  Serve <br/>
&gt; hot or cold with crackers, vegetable dippers or bread.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **You can also microwave it--prepare it the same way but cook it in <br/>
&gt; the microwave on medium for 4 to 6 minutes until it's thoroughly <br/>
&gt; heated, stirring once halfway through cooking.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; Cooking is one of my other passions, I've just been without a <br/>
&gt; kitchen for several months recently thanks to our DIY home <br/>
&gt; renovation.  We're about 75% through with the kitchen now so I'm <br/>
&gt; almost back in business!  Can't wait!!!  ;)<br/>
