<br/>
A bunch of friends and I went out tidepooling in the amazing low low <br/>
tide of the year at Salt Creek County Park. After having an <br/>
interaction with a Hairy Hermit Crab, we had to base a letterbox on <br/>
our experience. If you're ever out near Port Angeles, go and visit <br/>
Harry. He'd love to make some new friends. :)<br/>
<br/>
His clues are on the website. Haven't put a letterboxing website of <br/>
my own together yet but i'm sure it'll happen once it stops being so <br/>
sunny!<br/>
<br/>
And I finally carved my stamp. Finally. <br/>
