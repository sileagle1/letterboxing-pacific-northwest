like to write about letterboxing in the Oregon City area (for the regional <br>

myself, but had decided not to write an article on this subject, after having <br>
gotten some negative feedback from the local LBers.  I suggested to her that <br>
some LBers wanted to keep this a secret hobby.  Well, it appears the intrepid <br>
reporter is not to be thrown off the track so easily.  She's just contacted me, <br>
asking if I would be willing (or know someone who would be willing) to allow <br>
her to tag along on a letterboxing quest.  SO....<br>
<br>
What do you want me to do?<br>
<br>
I am not opposed to simply telling her no--and if that's what ya'll prefer, <br>
that's what I'll do.  However, keep in mind that a recent article in Portland <br>
Parent means that it is highly likely SOMEBODY from the Oregonian is going to <br>
be writing an article soon.  This reporter already has the green light from her <br>
editor, and--if she's any kind of reporter at all--she will write the story <br>
whether it has to be about her own experiences finding LBs, or about tagging <br>
along with someone else.  One advantage to one of us being along is that LBing <br>
can be presented in an environmentally-friendly light.  She's requested my <br>
response ASAP--she's got a deadline to meet--so speak up folks!  What's the <br>

I think if you go along with her and give the information that is <br>
important to us Letterboxers it would be fine!!!!! I am very <br>
cautious about who I tell, this is a great hobby, and I want to tell <br>
the world, but dont want to have boxes missing because of it too.  <br>
So if you are with her explaining everything I think it would be <br>
fine!!!<br>
Just my 2 cents!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In the beginning, I wasn't so sure that articles <br>
of this nature were such a good idea, as drawing <br>
attention to such an activity can sometimes have a <br>
negative effect.<br>
<br>
However, the story of Letterboxing has already been<br>
written up many times before, and no doubt<br>
will be again in the future.  You certainly<br>
wouldn't be sharing anything new that the<br>
media hasn't already become aware of.  <br>
<br>
I'm a little surprised, though, that a "reporter"<br>
wouldn't just go out on their own for a letterbox<br>
adventure.  On the other hand, the request to <br>
tag along could work well for us, allowing us to<br>
share some KEY INPUTS about Letterboxing, especially <br>
for new folks becoming interested in the activity.  <br>
<br>
Since this "sport" has increased expedentially in <br>
popularity within the last couple of years, perhaps<br>
it's a good time to help educate those who are new to it<br>
and refresh those that have been doing it for awhile too.<br>
<br>
As far as the process goes to get a letterbox together, it isn't <br>
rocket science.  You carve (hopefully) a stamp, place it in a <br>
container that seals well, include a small journal to record <br>
visitors, publish clues in order to find the box and hide it <br>
accordingly.<br>
<br>
It's not the process that concerns me, instead its the responsibility <br>
of the sport and those who take part in it.  The key inputs I'm <br>
talking about are things like "where to responsibly hide your <br>
boxes", "what kind of ink works best (permanent ink vs. the other <br>
kinds)", "why cleaning the stamp after using it makes sense and how <br>
easy it is to do", "how to properly rehide the box so others can <br>
share in the fun", "properly maintaining your boxes", "finding owners <br>
to adopt them if you want out or can't properly maintain them", etc...<br>
<br>
Like all good things, responsibility has to come into play <br>
somewhere, or we are all just hiding little pieces of trash<br>
all over our countryside, which will eventually create a negative <br>
impression of what Letterboxing is really all about.  <br>
<br>
Take the subject of "where to hide boxes" for instance.  Not many<br>
folks I've spoken with about this subject care for it much.  Perhaps <br>
it is too convicting for them.  But doesn't it make sense to hide our <br>
boxes in a reasonable location, not in areas where it is not wanted <br>
or difficult to keep concealed by its finders?  Some examples include <br>
hiding boxes on Private land, National Parks, private gardens or <br>
land, caves, private establishments, environmental protected or <br>
sensitive areas, etc...<br>
<br>
I believe placing boxes in these kinds of areas can be okay "with <br>
permission", but I'd bet most folks who place boxes in those areas <br>
already know that if they had asked permission to put it there, the <br>
answer would most likely have been "NO".  So, they do it anyway <br>
without asking.<br>
<br>
What kind of example is that for our children, especially since so <br>
many families enjoy this activity together?  Aren't we demonstrating <br>
that it's okay to ignore laws and put Letterboxes wherever we want, <br>
just because it's a fun thing to do and we want it that way.  How is <br>
that really different than dumping our personal garbage wherever we <br>
want?<br>
<br>
Quickly fading are the days it seems of skillful written clues to <br>
entice the seeker to find the Letterbox.  Like in the days when Der <br>
Mad Stamper was around, or Thom Powell, the pioneers of Letterboxing <br>
in this area.  Now days, it seems more important to put out as many <br>
boxes as you can, just to improve your "P" count.  Clues so simple <br>
you can literally step out of your car, take 1-10 ten steps, turn <br>
over the most obvious rock, and collect an image of a stamp <br>
consisting of a few scratches on an eraser.  Perhaps the "P" count <br>
should refer to Pathetic, instead of Placed.<br>
<br>
<br>
But alas, I am off on a tangent here.  Still, I believe the points I <br>
brought up needed to be made.<br>
<br>
Back to the topic on the reporter, "yes", tell her about Letterboxing <br>
and talk about the KEY INPUTS that will keep it a fun sport for a <br>
long time to come.<br>

<br>
I agree.  I found out about letterboxing from an article.  The one in <br>
Smithsonian.<br>
<br>
A well written article giving information that has been discussed, <br>
such as land ethic leave no trace is good for our activity.<br>
<br>
Personally I find the idea of trying to keep it private somewhat <br>
arrogant and self righteous.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<br>
Please let me know what you think about the following:<br>
<br>
A few weeks back, a reporter from the Oregonian (South Metro=Oregon City<br>
<br>
area) posted a message to the main board, asking for info for an article<br>
she'd <br>
like to write about letterboxing in the Oregon City area (for the<br>
regional <br>
edition of that paper).  I responded to her, saying that I was a<br>
freelance writer <br>
myself, but had decided not to write an article on this subject, after<br>
having <br>
gotten some negative feedback from the local LBers.  I suggested to her<br>
that <br>
some LBers wanted to keep this a secret hobby.  Well, it appears the<br>
intrepid <br>
reporter is not to be thrown off the track so easily.  She's just<br>
contacted me, <br>
asking if I would be willing (or know someone who would be willing) to<br>
allow <br>
her to tag along on a letterboxing quest.  SO....<br>
<br>
What do you want me to do?<br>
<br>
I am not opposed to simply telling her no--and if that's what ya'll<br>
prefer, <br>
that's what I'll do.  However, keep in mind that a recent article in<br>
Portland <br>
Parent means that it is highly likely SOMEBODY from the Oregonian is<br>
going to <br>
be writing an article soon.  This reporter already has the green light<br>
from her <br>
editor, and--if she's any kind of reporter at all--she will write the<br>
story <br>
whether it has to be about her own experiences finding LBs, or about<br>
tagging <br>
along with someone else.  One advantage to one of us being along is that<br>
LBing <br>
can be presented in an environmentally-friendly light.  She's requested<br>
my <br>
response ASAP--she's got a deadline to meet--so speak up folks!  What's<br>
the <br>
consensus of this community???<br>
