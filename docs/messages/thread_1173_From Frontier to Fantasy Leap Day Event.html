<br>
    Thank you for the nice kudos for this gathering.  MiniBullyMom <br>
went above & beyond the call of duty in placing so many nice boxes <br>
for the gathering and for setting up the picnic area.  Thank you, <br>
thank you, thank you!!!  We managed to find 2 boxes during the event <br>
and they were both precious finds!  Can't wait to get a chance to go <br>
back and find some of the others in the park.  We were having so <br>
much fun catching up with the boxers that we weren't able to tackle <br>
as many letterboxes as we'd like.  It was so nice to get to meet so <br>
many new letterboxers from the area.  A special welcome goes out to <br>
all the boxers who traveled so far to attend the event!!!  All in <br>
all a perfect leap through history venturing from frontiers to <br>
fantasies!!!<br>
<br>
Look forward to seeing you all again along the letterboxing trails <br>
in the future!!!<br>

We left the park with my F count at 99, but when Ravensburger saw the <br>
2 for 1 fish & chips sign, I took it as a sign to turn around and <br>
grab one more. So that makes 100! And gee, just happened to run into <br>
Bookworn, SleepyWhippet and Seashore for that find ;-)<br>
<br>
And the rain never did materialize!<br>
