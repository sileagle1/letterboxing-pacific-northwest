<br>
I'm really thinking that taking a trip to Spokane tomorrow isn't <br>
what 'we' (our family) should be doing this weekend in light of the <br>
current tragedy in the Gulf Coast region. I'm considering donating <br>
the money we would have spent on fuel/expenses traveling to/fro <br>
Spokane to letterboxers from LA/MS who have been adversely affected <br>
by Katrina instead. The President has asked that we, as a nation, <br>
conserve fuel in the near future to help reduce the amount of demand <br>
on the nation's fuel resources and I just can't justify traveling <br>
the distance for purely 'recreational' reasons knowing we'd be <br>
adding to the nation's fuel burden at the moment when other <br>
countrymates need it much more than do we.<br>
<br>
I feel a strong tie to New Orleans as we've spent some considerable <br>
time exploring it 'via letterboxing' a couple of weeks these past <br>
two years. I also lived not too terribly far away from in Galveston <br>
many moons ago and remember vividly what it's like to have to <br>
evacuate due to dangerous weather only to return home and observe <br>
row boats floating down residential streets. Thankfully, we never <br>
had to experience the extent of devastation that this region is <br>
unfortunately now enduring. My heart goes out to the folks who are <br>
enduring this living hell right now! I can only pray that God <br>
comforts and provides abundantly for the people who have been so <br>
greatly affected by the hurricane and its aftermath. <br>
<br>
Just hoping folks will understand why I'm deciding to not attend the <br>
gathering. I know how much effort goes into planning an event and <br>
appreciate HSMommy for all of her tireless effort in coordinating <br>
it. I feel like a cad for backing out but hope that it proves to be <br>
an incredible success. I apologize profusely for 'bailing out' at <br>
the last minute. If I need to send any money to help cover the costs <br>
please contact me offline and I will happily do so.<br>
<br>
Thanks for understanding,<br>
<br>
