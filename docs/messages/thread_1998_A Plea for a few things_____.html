I'm the co-leader of GS Troop 2199.  Maybe you've<br/>
visited the Troop 2199 box at the dog park in<br/>
Vancouver???<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, our troop of 12 girls will be planting a<br/>
series of boxes with a GS theme in Camp Currie, Camas,<br/>
WA during the month of May.  <br/>
<br/>
Before we can do that, though, we need to get some<br/>
stamps carved.  So, I am coming on here pleading for a<br/>
bit of assistance IF anyone can be of help.  This is<br/>
merely a plea - please don't slam me for<br/>
asking.....SMILE!<br/>
<br/>
1.  Does anyone have scraps (min. size 1 1/4" each)<br/>
that they won't be using or are willing to donate to a<br/>
Girl Scout troop?<br/>
<br/>
2.  Does anyone have blocks of carving material<br/>
sitting around that they won't use? and are willing to<br/>
donate? (I believe we need 5 - 4x4 blocks to complete<br/>
this task).<br/>
<br/>
3.  Does anyone have carving tools that we could<br/>
borrow and return??? (I have four sets currently).<br/>
<br/>
4.  Is anyone willing to TEACH basic carving to a Girl<br/>
Scout Troop????  I can do this myself but the girls<br/>
love to have a NEW person come in and teach. (MAIDEN<br/>
was a GEM and came in and taught the girls how to<br/>
bookbind! WOOHOO MAIDEN!  We love you!!!)<br/>
<br/>
You can answer on this list or email me privately.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for even considering being a helper<br/>
to our troop!!!  SMILE!<br/>

If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br/>
