                    <div class="plaintext-content">I checked on Rise and Shine in Troutdale yesterday. It had been reported<br>
missing. It was in fact there, but the box was missing. All three bags (the<br>
stamp, log book, and introduction note) were there together, but the box was<br>
missing. I took the pieces home with me because I didn't have a box with me<br>
to replace it. It should be replaced by weeks end.<br>
