Hi everyone,<br>
I just spoke to a guy at Litbery Lake. Usually they don't take <br>
reservations, but because we are so far ahead of everything they are <br>
going to try to make an exception for us. Howerver I need to kind of <br>
give them a number. If you even have slight chance that you may come <br>
on Labor Day Weekend. I need to know. If everyone who suspects that <br>
they may come I would really appreciate it. I am really looking <br>
forward to this. I expecially need to know how many RV's because <br>
they only have so many RV sites. They told me that they never turn <br>
away Tents cause they can find room. Please everyone, this is going <br>
to be a great weekend.<br>

We plan on attending, too.  We'll need 1 tent site and (at the <br>
moment) will have 3 people in our group.  1 adult and 2 children <br>
(aged 6 & 3)<br>
