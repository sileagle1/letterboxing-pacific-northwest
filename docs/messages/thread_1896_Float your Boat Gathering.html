Hi Everyone,<br/>
I am planning a gathering for the east side of Washington. It will <br/>
be Labor Day weekend at Liberty Lake County Park. Beatiful area. <br/>
There is RV camping and tent camping. Tent is $15 and RV is $20. It <br/>
will be a lot of fun. If you can come, please let me know so I can <br/>
compile a list of how many people will be here. There are a mass of <br/>
trail and swimming. It will be a whole lot of fun.<br/>

Cute name for the gathering!<br/>
We're interested in going but need to figure out if it's possible.  I called<br/>
Liberty Lake and they don't know if they're going to take camping<br/>
reservations or not. .... they'll call back.  We need an RV spot.  And<br/>
friends would need tent sites.<br/>
Or are you planning on only doing a day program?   Either way which day(s)<br/>
are you planning on?<br/>

I also called Liberty Lake, they said that they were not taking reservation, but if we had a count we could give them a heads up and let them know and they could do something for us. They also said the RV sites can hold one RV or two tents and there are also just tent sites.<br/>
