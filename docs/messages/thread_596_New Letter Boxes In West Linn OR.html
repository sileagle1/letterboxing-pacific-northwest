I got two plants in and it only took me a month after moving here. It <br>
is crazy what movie can do to your life.<br>
<br>
The clues are posted on the Letterboxing website under West Linn <br>
Clackamas County.<br>
<br>
The boxes are called:<br>
<br>
"The Rose of Chaos" and "My Back Yard Friend"<br>
<br>
For any of you that go after these boxes you are right in my area and <br>
really close to my house, so drop me a line and we can meet at the <br>
Starbucks that you start at to do an exchange!<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting!<br>
