                    <div class="plaintext-content">After a four-day camping trip in Central OR, I was able to explore a <br>
bunch or letterboxes and introduce a friend (Kokopelli) to the lovely <br>
hobby of letterboxing!<br>
<br>
Here's an update of the boxes we found (and didn't find):<br>
<br>
#1--Waterfowl Highway<br>
Great box and great stamp!<br>
<br>
#2--Crooked River Bridge<br>
Kokopelli had great stories of bringing her godkids here.  It was a <br>
beautiful, warm windy day and the bridges are beautiful!<br>
<br>
#3--Crooked River Ranch #1<br>
On the way down to this box, I saw a Bandit camper that looked <br>
suspiciously like the one Funhog was staying in at the McIver Campout <br>
last summer!  Hmm...could it be?<br>
<br>
#4--Crooked River Ranch #2<br>
Another good stamp!  Time didn't permit us to get the other 2 however-<br>
-maybe next time?<br>
<br>
#5--Eagle Crest<br>
This looks like a great little resort getaway!  And a great stamp too!<br>
<br>
We also attempted Funhog's box at Eagle Crest, but to no avail!  <br>
<br>
#6--Cline Falls<br>
Beautiful falls!<br>
<br>
#7--Tetherow House<br>
Wow, all I could think of as I walked around this house was what it <br>
must have been like to live there 100 years ago!  Another great stamp <br>
by Funhog!<br>
<br>
#8--Blue Fisherman<br>
It took us a while to find this stamp because there were a few old <br>
trees lying across the path, but eventually Kokopelli figured it out!<br>
<br>
#9--Dry River Canyon #1<br>
We had no trouble finding the first stamp, but spent a considerable <br>
amount of time searching for the second stamp--with no luck!  After <br>
about 45 minutes of searching where we thought it would be, we sadly <br>
gave up.  <br>
<br>
#10--Redmond Redhawk<br>
Very impressive stamp!  <br>
<br>
#11--My New Niece<br>
Cute park, but there was some guy that was really interested in what <br>
we were doing, so it took us a while to complete the operation <br>
without him seeing.<br>
<br>
#12--Sam Johnson Park<br>
Great stamp--didn't see any rockchucks here, but saw them at many <br>
other lb sites.<br>
<br>
#13--Odin Falls<br>
Another beautiful falls!<br>
<br>
#14--Tetherow Crossing<br>
I think this may have been the most impressive stamp I got on this <br>
trip!  It was the perfect end to letterboxing day #3.<br>
<br>
#15--Sawyer Park<br>
Because of construction on the street, we actually drove past this <br>
park twice before we found it!  Cute park though!  There were <br>
numerous picnics going on!  I'm bummed that we missed the two new <br>
boxes that were placed there the same day that we found this box!<br>
<br>
#16--Drake Park<br>
I absolutely loved this park!  This was definitely a high-traffic <br>
area though!  It took us a while to get teh box replaced without <br>
being seen.<br>
<br>
#17--Lost Puppy<br>
I was amazed by the huge houses that we saw on the way to this park!  <br>
To anyone else going for this box--although Red Tuff Gulch is not on <br>
the trail map, it is out there!  Great stamp--we couldn't believe <br>
that it was hand-carved!<br>
<br>
Thank you to everyone who has hidden stamps in this area!  It was <br>
actually the first time I have ever traveled to central Oregon!  I <br>
think the Hoppy Hunters were hitting the boxes about the same time we <br>
were--on some occasions they had just stamped in before us on the <br>
same day.  It also looks like we just missed Amanda and Ryan by a <br>
week on most boxes.  Anyway, it was a great four days of boxing and a <br>
much needed getaway!<br>

and possably move letterbox #2. If there are any changes I'll post them <br>

is like, but we've come across signs like that in BL*M l*ands in WA <br>
and i*t *turn*ed out to be due to temporary logging/thinning <br>
operations in the area.  In our situation, they did offer a 'marked' <br>
detour to the trail *we were following but it turned it into a *6 <br>
mile (one way) hike to the falls instead of a *3 mile (one way) so <br>
we aborted the mission because I didn't think the kids & I were up <br>
for a 12 mile outing that day (the oldest one was *3 at the time and <br>
the youngest about 8 months and in the baby pack).  Since then, the <br>
state has closed the neighboring park altogether due to 'lack of <br>
funds'--so we have never returned.  :(  The waterfalls, however, <br>
remain--albeit unvisited...  :(<br>
