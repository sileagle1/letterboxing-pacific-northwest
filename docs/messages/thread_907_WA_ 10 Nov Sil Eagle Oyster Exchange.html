  Directions to the restaurant:<br/>
<br/>

  Keep LEFT to stay on Ramp 0.5 miles <br/>
  Keep STRAIGHT onto 14th Ave SE 0.3 miles <br/>

  If you get disoriented for some reason (which is a tad easy in a <br/>

  boats!!!<br/>
<br/>
  It's about 50 miles from SeaTac Airport and about 125 miles<br/>
  from downtown Portland.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I, personally, had an awesome time!!!  This being my first event, I was so <br/>
excited to see there were others out there as much in love with LB'ing as <br/>
me.  :)  It was great to meet some fellow LBers and get tips and <br/>
encouragement, and hear about everyone's favorite LBs.<br/>
<br/>
I was extremely impressed with the stamps... You guys are amazing.  I was <br/>
wondering if anyone has ever thought of having a "how to carve great stamps" <br/>
event... I would be very interested in some tutoring, and happy to pay for <br/>
the supplies.  I have some ideas for other stamps, but do not feel like I <br/>
can do them justice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a great time, Hope to see everyone again soon... :)<br/>
<br/>
Jessi<br/>

&gt;Date: Tue, 11 Nov 2003 06:55:45 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just got home from the last minute event and was delighted that,<br/>
&gt;despite the driving rain in the region, 15 folks were able to join<br/>
&gt;us for such a hastily arranged event.  Oysters were shucked,<br/>
&gt;microbrews were gulped and the stamping frenzy began unabated...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was so cool to finally meet Silver Eagle in person after<br/>
&gt;following his letterboxing pursuits all around the Lone Star State<br/>
&gt;(our previous home) over the past year.  What an incredible<br/>
&gt;whirlwind Pacific Northwest trek he is currently on (how many<br/>
&gt;letterboxes did he manage to visit since he landed at SeaTac<br/>
&gt;yesterday--20, 30 or more? Wow!!!) while he's in the region.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks, folks (Fudrick, Mummsie, trkee, rnrB, trkr, jessi, the<br/>
&gt;Moores, RayvenMom, RayvenDad, Nailhead &amp; Happy Mom), for joining us<br/>
&gt;in meeting Silver Eagle and we hope you enjoyed your time--I<br/>
&gt;certainly did! ;)  I'm a bit bummed that I just realized I forgot to<br/>
&gt;take pictures at the event AND I had my camera on me...well, in the<br/>
&gt;words of Dierks Bentley--"What was I thinkin'?"  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hopefully, we'll be able to visit some more with everybody on<br/>
&gt;Saturday morning, 15 Nov 03, at Wapato Park in Tacoma from 0930-1030<br/>
&gt;near the Greek Columns by the Eastern entrance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;See you on the trails soon,<br/>
