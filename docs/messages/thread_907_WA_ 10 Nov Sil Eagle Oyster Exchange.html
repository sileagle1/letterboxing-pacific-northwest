  It's official!!!  Currently, have 12 confirmed folks--made <br>
  reservations for 20 (although that can always be increased)--please <br>
  join us for the:<br>

  Silver Eagle Oyster Exchange<br>

  Olympia, WA<br>
  Mon, 10 Nov 03<br>
  7pm--until you have to leave<br>
<br>
  Oyster House Restaurant<br>
  320 4th Ave West<br>
  (near the marina/Bayview Thriftway/dancing waters fountain)<br>
  Kid friendly, sports bar atmosphere establishment...<br>
<br>
<br>
  We will carve the event stamp during the event!!!  <br>
  Get ready to shuck some of the sweetest oysters in the world...<br>
<br>
  Please email me directly or post to the list if you plan on<br>
  attending, include # of folks in your party who will attend. If you<br>
  can't stay for a meal and just want to drop by for a quick exchange,<br>
  that would work as well.  <br>
<br>
  Thanks,<br>

<br>
  Directions to the restaurant:<br>
<br>
  From Interstate 5 in Olympia.  Take I-5, to Exit 105.<br>
  At exit 105, turn RIGHT onto Ramp 0.2 miles <br>
  Keep LEFT to stay on Ramp 0.5 miles <br>
  Keep STRAIGHT onto 14th Ave SE 0.3 miles <br>
  Turn RIGHT (North) onto Capitol Way S 0.6 miles <br>
  *Turn potentially restricted* Turn LEFT (West) onto<br>
  5th Ave SW 0.1 miles <br>
  Turn RIGHT (North) onto Water St SW 0.0 miles <br>
  Arrive  0.0 miles <br>
<br>
  If you get disoriented for some reason (which is a tad easy in a <br>
  city of one way streets), find the Capitol Bldg, head North to the <br>
  water, look for the marina and Bayview Thriftway grocery store--the <br>
  restaurant is due East of the Thriftway and due South of ALL of the <br>
  boats!!!<br>
<br>
  It's about 50 miles from SeaTac Airport and about 125 miles<br>
  from downtown Portland.<br>

me.  :)  It was great to meet some fellow LBers and get tips and <br>
encouragement, and hear about everyone's favorite LBs.<br>
<br>
I was extremely impressed with the stamps... You guys are amazing.  I was <br>
wondering if anyone has ever thought of having a "how to carve great stamps" <br>
event... I would be very interested in some tutoring, and happy to pay for <br>
the supplies.  I have some ideas for other stamps, but do not feel like I <br>
can do them justice.<br>
