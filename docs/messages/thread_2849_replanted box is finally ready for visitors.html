I just struggled through editing my Western Corvid box to include a <br>
photo clue.  Don't ask me how I managed to do it - since it's always a <br>
crap shoot that I can even get the photos off the camera, much less <br>
edit the photo, get it sized correctly and in the right format.  I just <br>
pushed buttons until everything showed up.  If you have any problems <br>
with the technical aspects of the clue, I'm betting I won't be any <br>
help.  I know just enough to be dangerous.<br>
<br>
And for those of you who notice the replant date was in March, I would <br>
direct you to another box I planted <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=52561 for the <br>
whole story. <br>
<br>
Now get out there and find it.  Have fun! <br>
