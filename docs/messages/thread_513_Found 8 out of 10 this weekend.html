                    <div class="plaintext-content">So it was a busy Sunday for us.  We headed out to Lincoln City, <br/>
here's what we found:<br/>
<br/>
*Devils Lake, alive and well<br/>
*We Love Lincoln City, yes, it REALLY is there, I have to admit, I <br/>
did cheat after seraching and called Carie on her cell and had her <br/>
walk me thru it! Duh, just like the clues said, but under some <br/>
blackberry brambles<br/>
*Boiler Bay.... doing fine<br/>
*Spruce Goose!  What a cool little park!  <br/>
*Devils Punch Bowl, woo hoo, firsties!<br/>
*then 3 out of 4 at Tresures of the Sea at Fogerty Creek State Park, <br/>
for the life of me, I cannot believe that it could be missing so <br/>
fast, but #4 was no where to be found by us!<br/>
*and last but not least, we struck out at Beneath the Blue #2. We <br/>
were getting tired, and dd was trying to sleep on us, and dh had had <br/>
it, so I think maybe we didn't get far enough, but gave it up for <br/>
another day.  We did however escape a near epic proportions <br/>
catastrophe, when looking around a tree stump, I noticed movement, <br/>
before it noticed us, and revealed we were inches away from a <br/>
swarming hornets nest....  My 2 year olds stroller the closest to it, <br/>
and me having about 5 minutes to get my shot before I go into <br/>
convulsions if I get stung....  All I could say is go, go, go and <br/>
point.  Luckily dh didn't stick around to question me until we had <br/>
cleared the area.... Whew!  After the bees, we decided to call it a <br/>
day.  And what a great doy it was....  OH<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along our travels, I turned loose "hitch hiker costal <br/>
conch"  OK, so I am not good with names, but it is a cool stamp I <br/>
think.....  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had as much fun this weekend!  I am still waiting to <br/>
hear from anyone who has made it up to the new series at Trillium <br/>
Lake on Mt Hood.  Anyone, yet?      <br/>
