Hi - bluerosegang here:  We're also pretty new to LB {Nov 2004) but <br/>
we just jumped right in.  We even tried carving our first stamp this <br/>
weekend and it turned out ok - nothing special but at least we know <br/>
we can do it and I'm sure we'll improve with practice.  <br/>
<br/>
We used a block of carving rubber from the craft store, a regular #2 <br/>
pencil and an exacto knife as our only tools.  We outlined the image <br/>
with pencil, turned the paper over and rubbed it onto the rubber <br/>
block - the image came out pretty clean.  Then we just carved it <br/>
out.  Does anyone else have a better technique?  Our most asked <br/>
question is:  What is the best way to get the image onto the rubber <br/>
block?<br/>
<br/>
Happy LB'ing<br/>

&gt; I'm planning to get involved in letterboxing it sounds like a fun <br/>
&gt; thing to do with the family. My question is, is there anywhere to <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; a stamp made for you...I'm not very artistic, my hubby can draw, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; I don't think hes up for carving. We are in Oregon.  If anyone <br/>
knows <br/>
&gt; of anywhere, or if anyone would be willing to do one for us let me <br/>
&gt; know.<br/>

Hi BRG,<br/>
There are several tutorials posted through out the web sites via <br/>
links. Ryan's Atlas Quest www.atlasquest.com would be a good <br/>
starting place. There is even a Carving Board (sounds like I'm <br/>
touting a cooking show)that is set up for conversations about stamp <br/>
carving. If you get any responses on this post from Funhog ,Pandora, <br/>
or Cadenza you should pay attention as they are all great stamp <br/>
carvers,as are many others in the PNW.<br/>
There are several ways to transfer images. One is the pencil, thumb <br/>
scaping method I still use, other carvers swear by acetone transfer <br/>
or warm iron transfer. I haven't tried the iron technique as I'm a <br/>
little afraid that any iron use by me might tilt the balance of <br/>
household duties. The acetone method can really work well, but it <br/>
takes some practice, and the right kind of printer.<br/>
Since you are fairly new to letterboxing here is an alternate site <br/>
