                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Guys,<br/>
<br/>
I just posted this to the Great Lakes board. I thought I would post <br/>
it here as well to get as much feed back as I can before I <br/>
potentially ruin a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to one of my favorite locals next week . . . Galena, IL.<br/>
<br/>
I will be planting some boxes along the way and hopefully finding <br/>
some as well - though Jo Davies County is rather sparse.<br/>
<br/>
One of my boxes I am going to plant will be inside a hotel, the <br/>
Stoney Creek Inn and I have been rummaging the schematics of the <br/>
place in my mind thinking of where to hide a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The pool area is great with a rocky waterfall going into the hot tub. <br/>
However, there are "keep off the rocks" signs and a video camera <br/>
pointed at the hot tub.<br/>
<br/>
I thought my best bet would be in the sauna behind or under the <br/>
heating box. Thus my question, what is the melting point of PZ Kut?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried this, will the first finder find a melted glob of <br/>
goo? I'm planning on at least one more box to be hidden in the <br/>
breakfast room so I am scouring my mind for other ideas besides the <br/>
sauna . . . anyone? Anyone??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

You could try hiding a small piece of uncarved PZ Kut there then<br/>
checking up on it later to see how well it's holding up. =) If it's a<br/>
melted glop of goo, you'd obviously need to find a better place for it.<br/>
