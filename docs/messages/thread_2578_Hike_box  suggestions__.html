                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
Martini Man & myself will be in the Pacific Northwest AUG 26 through <br>
SEP 9.  We like to do more challenging hikes in terms of distance and <br>
elevation and really like it if we can find a box or two along the <br>
way. Can any of you recommend some specific boxes that are on a more <br>
challenging hike?<br>
<br>
We'll be flying in/out of Seattle, but since we will be out there for <br>
15 full days, we're willing to venture out a bit.  We'll probably be <br>
back down to Oregon to do some hikes we missed last summer.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

all east of the Issaquah area pushing into Snoqualmie Pass off of I-90.<br>

Another area that was neat was Salt Creek County Park off the beaten <br>

Another neat area is Whidbey Island--especially the Deception Pass area <br>

rugged coastline views.<br>

Yes, we left about 10 days ago--kicking & screaming all the way.  We're <br>
in Boise for a few more hours and then it's back on the road and beyond <br>
the ethernet for a few more weeks.  We're National Park & Monument <br>
hopping our way across the US--camping most of the way.  ;)  <br>
<br>
We're trying to letterbox a bit between here & there but our success <br>
rate hasn't been so hot.  For the last 11 attempts over 3 days in SE <br>
Oregon & NE California, we found 2 letterboxes and about 15 geocaches <br>
(mostly virtual/earthcache types as they were in 'hot' lands and many <br>
of the LBs we searched for were status unknown as it was to begin <br>
with).  Otherwise the trip has been incredible so far!!!  <br>
<br>
Somehow we turned a 550 mile drive from Tacoma to Boise into a 1,300 <br>
mile, 10-day, 4-state adventure.  Go figure!  ;)  I'd blog it but the <br>
internet access as well as cell phone coverage is too sparse in the <br>
locales we keep finding ourselves in.  ;) We'll catch up on the flip <br>
side, though.  We also have our new baby (DSLR camera) with us so we're <br>
having a blast learning how to use all its nifty features.  Thank <br>
goodness it doesn't need diaper changes.  ;)<br>
<br>
Have a great trip to the PNW!!!  It'll be awesome!<br>

have a wonderful time trekking across the coutry. What a wonderful<br>
time.  You can really sing "I love to go a wondering..."<br>
<br>
now about those cameras, yes it is great the diapers don't have to get<br>
changed, but with ours it seems the batteries die at the most<br>
innopportune times, aargh, almost as bad as a diaper.<br>
<br>
Too bad we didn't get to meet. Hope y'all enjoyed that Stargazers.<br>
