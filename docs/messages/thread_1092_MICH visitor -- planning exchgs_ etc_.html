<br>
I will be coming from MICH to Portland for a week next month.<br>
<br>
Funhog has suggested meeting me at on Wed (2/18) at the Laurelwood <br>
Pub to exchange stamps.  We haven't decided on a time yet, but I was <br>
thinking that after meetings all day, I would be interested in <br>
dinner (as well as one of those good beers she told me they have)<br>
<br>
Melanine/Maiden1974 has made a very generous offer to pick me up <br>
from the Embassay Suites-Airport hotel on Friday (2/20) when she <br>
gets out of work and take me boxing. Then we thought a Friday <br>
evening thing might be fun. We haven't set times or places for this <br>
yet, though.<br>
<br>
My Kent Trails letterbox, which is under a couple feet of snow right <br>
now, had a hitch hiker last time I checked.  If it's still there, <br>
I'll liberate him and bring 'em along, too!<br>
<br>
Hope to meet a bunch of you!<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
