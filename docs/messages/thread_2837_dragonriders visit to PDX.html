just wanted to say thanx for all that came to the meet and greet so i <br/>
could meet you all. was a hectic time trying to do exchanges and meet <br/>
everyone. im sure i didnt get to say hi to all of you. so if i <br/>
didnt,this is my apology and my "hello",nice to meet you". the time was <br/>
short and some of us did exchanges in the dark by flashlight. how <br/>
typical is that of letterboxers??? have to have that last image...<br/>
<br/>
and a big thank you to maiden and marmalade for chauffeuring me around <br/>
town finding letterboxes.<br/>
and must say "hey" to buppsters and camp fire lady for meeting me <br/>
sunday evening on your way home from a long day of boxing. was good to <br/>
meet you with the others.<br/>
this wont be the last time i come through PDX. so we will all get <br/>
together again sometime soon.<br/>
again, many thanx.<br/>
later,dragonrider83338<br/>
