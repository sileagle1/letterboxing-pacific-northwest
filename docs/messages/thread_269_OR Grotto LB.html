always wanted to go other than on a December evening (they do <br>
Christmas lights) and the Grotto LB was our motivation.<br>
<br>
Canada Goose planned out a great way to find the box, too, and I <br>
really enjoyed the stamp.<br>

The birds were singing profusely, the sun was actually shining and it <br>
was just an exquisite experience.<br>

Hope others can make it when they are in the Portland area!<br>
