                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well it seems history is doomed to repeat itself. I suppose it was <br>
bound to happen to me sooner or later.  This morning I posted a <br>
forward email, and email that was being forwarded to my husband <br>
Iron`Bear and Steve of Team Rayvenhaus because I wanted them to know <br>
something personal that was going on.  Stupid me that email somehow <br>
got addressed to the LBPNW list.<br>
<br>
I find it sort of ironic that I made this mistake considering that <br>
the ball that made this whole issue drop not a year ago was Ryan <br>
making the exact same mistake.<br>
<br>
That will teach me to write emails at 5:00am when I have woken up <br>
because I can't sleep and am not completely awake.<br>
<br>
I have deleted this post from the list and because of my error and <br>
the mistake I asked that anyone who got it on individual email or <br>
digest please refrain from commenting on it.  Please let's not turn <br>
my mistake into another huge argument in the PNW  a lot of people <br>
are already very hurt over what is going on.<br>
<br>
I apologize immensely to my friend Funhog and to anyone else that was <br>
mentioned in the letter for this showing up on the list, please know <br>
that was never my intention and that I have done everything I can to <br>
rectify the situation and I feel terrible.<br>
<br>
I am truly very sorry,<br>

Shoot!  I just KNEW I should get individual e-mails sent to me!  But <br>
noooo....  I have to read posts on the web.  *sigh*<br>

Don't feel too bad, though. It happens to the best of us.  ;o)  Yahoo <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortunately Ryan I can't blame it on Yahoo :) I can only blame it on my<br>
own typos. I use Outlook express and it does that stupid fill things in for<br>
you based on the first letter you type.  I was emailing it to one of<br>
Iron`Bear's alternate email accounts that started with an L and Outlook<br>
decided it was email it to LbPNW@yahoo.com -- at 5:00 in the morning when<br>
I've been really sick, was up in pain and had just taken pain medication and<br>
trying to cure a migraine was a bad time to be sending emails, I just didn't<br>
notice Outlook had filled it in for me.  <br>
<br>
So regardless of the fact that accidents happen, I feel like a little piece<br>
of poop -- a total terd.<br>
<br>
Oh well, hopefully everyone else is as understanding as you were.<br>

Just for the record, anyone that *does* post in reply to it will have <br>
their post deleted.  Pandora would like the topic to die, and I can't <br>
imagine stringing it along will help anything, so anybody caught <br>
posting about it will have their posts deleted and be put on <br>
moderated status (at least temporarily until the whole thing blows <br>
over).<br>
