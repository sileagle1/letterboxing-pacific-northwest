Cat's Meow and I had a wonderful time and met some great new <br>
letterboxers in the area. Your daughter Tooth Fairy is a doll! After <br>
exchanges, stamping into the Beat a Dead Horse Postal Box and <br>
catching up with old friends and making a few new ones we were off to <br>
box at CCC. Since the recent snow fall the area has had few changes. <br>
A lot of trees are down and we believe the tree that houses Perseus <br>
has fallen and has been cut up. We were unsuccessful in finding this <br>
box. The first box in the Duck Pond Friends series was found but we <br>
were unable to locate the second box. I am not saying it is missing, <br>
we just couldn't find it. If anyone has found this box please email <br>
me off site and let me know if we were in the right place. All of the <br>
Boxed Set Series is alive and well but somewhat soggy inside the <br>
boxes. We replaced baggies as much as we could but the log books were <br>
slightly damp. Thats to be expected because of the snow. We ran out <br>
of time and dark was upon us so we were unable to go after Nutria but <br>
that is left for another day. Before the event, Cat's Meow and I and <br>
Willow and kids went after a couple of boxes. Finally we have gone to <br>
find The Department of Redundancy Dept. letterbox. It is alive and <br>
well and was dug out of the snow. The Oregon Trail box is alive and <br>
well but the box is really thrashed. It needs to be replaced soon <br>
before the snow melt get it soaked. The parking lot of the Museum was <br>
ice covered and slippery so it made for a really challenging morning. <br>
After being cooped up inside for the past week it felt wonderful to <br>
finally get out and letterbox. The storm had given me some time to <br>
carve a few stamps though. Look for my Krispy Kreme Letterbox to be <br>
placed soon in honor of the Grand Opening of the new Krispy Kreme <br>
store in Vancouver and a new series of 4 boxes that were introduced <br>
at the gathering. Happy Trails!<br>

Gathering, lord knows we're suffering from it ourselves... But, with the<br>
programming that I'm working on, job hunting and my father to take care of,<br>
both our ability to letterbox and our ability to attend gatherings has been<br>
greatly reduced.  Add to that, the stamp we carved from the Dartmoor<br>
exchange got lost in the mail (pout).<br>
<br>
Oh well, they say the winter season is the dormant season, right?  (grin)<br>
<br>
A hearty hello to everyone farther south and we'll see everyone at one of<br>
the upcoming gatherings, I trust.<br>
<br>
Godspeed everyone.<br>
