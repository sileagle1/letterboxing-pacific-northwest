                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hope all of you were able to get and box this past weekend.  What a <br>
lovely weekend to go letterboxing!  <br>
<br>
Just an update on the boxes I went for this weekend:<br>
<br>
Sunburst (Estacada, Oregon) <br>
The box was slightly damp inside, but the baggies kept everything <br>
important dry.  No visitors to the box for a few months, but all was <br>
fine.  There was a Civil War reenactment going on, so I had to sneak <br>
behind enemy lines to get this one!<br>
<br>
Clackamas County Park Series - Rub-A-Dub (West Linn - ish, Oregon)<br>
A nice short walk.  The box looked just fine, but hasn't had many <br>
visitors.<br>
<br>
Paint My Wagon (Canby, Oregon)<br>
Lovely spot, great stamp.  Very few visitors!<br>
<br>
Clackamas County Park Series - Icebox (Mollala, Oregon)<br>
Another fun hunt provided by Sleepy Whippet.  Another lonely box.  <br>
Icebox was the last of this series I had to find and I'm very proud <br>
to have the bonus stamp in my book!<br>
<br>
MI(lo) or Bust (Estacada, Oregon)<br>
A VERY lonely box, with no visitors since last September!  Despite <br>
its loneliness the box was in good shape.  The park is lovely now <br>
with lots of new green things growing everywhere. <br>
<br>
Three Firs (Gresham, Oregon)<br>
Everything looks good, except the log book is a little empty.  And <br>
there were 2 AA batteries in the box.  Weird.<br>
<br>
So it was my week to visit lonely boxes.  Hope you all had a <br>
wonderful weekend.<br>

Washington/Oregon soon and get some more boxes found.... Lately we've been busy with the Angels & Demons Mystery box, <br>
the Secret Society Mystery and the Pirates of the Caribbean series.  Finding the perfect locations, planing the boxes <br>
and hiding the clues as well (A friend of mine said, after seeing how everything went together, that I was a very evil <br>
person, to which I responded, "No, Evil Glenn is evil, I am merely a devious little b@ast@rd".)<br>
<br>
We've been busy carving this winter, carving the Peanuts Series, the Snowdogs replacements and the Wapato park Fright <br>
Fest 2003 replacements.<br>
<br>
I've been experimenting with camouflage for the boxes and some of it is good enough that I think even plain "Walk you <br>
to on top of it" clues won't make it any easier to find them!<br>
<br>
Course, that's just my not so humble opinion! (grin)<br>

geocache up in Estacada, near some family.  There are<br>
TONS of letterboxes in Estacada.  More in that little<br>
town than our area (Eugene/Sprinfield).  <br>
<br>
I wanted to put out an idea for those of you into<br>
letterboxing, I'm going to be putting out my first<br>
letterbox soon, it will be a geocache and letterbox<br>
put together.  In the letterbox box, I was thinking of<br>
putting one of those little silocone shoe packets<br>
(like the ones you get in shoes to keep them dry in<br>
transit)....has anyone ever done this, does it work<br>
and is it a good idea?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Just my two cents--you certainly can make a hybrid, but I wouldn't <br>
recommend it.  Many geocachers don't know about letterboxing, and <br>
mistakingly take the stamp or some other hienous crime.  In addition-<br>
-a lot of letterboxers aren't exactly fans of geocaching.  They'll <br>
deliberately avoid going to known hybrids.  And if you don't tell <br>
them it's a hybrid ahead of time, they'll likely be upset at not <br>
knowing about it and "wasting their" time chasing after a "stupid <br>
hybrid".<br>
<br>
Nobody ever complains about a lack of hybrids, but a good number <br>
will likely complain (even if only behind your back) if you start <br>
hiding hybrids.  You can do it, but don't expect the boxes to be <br>
very popular.<br>
<br>
Good luck!  =)<br>

geocache be separated by at least 50 feet to avoid problems.  30 feet <br>
doesn't seem to be the magic distance anymore since the stamps &/or <br>
letterboxes continue to disappear (not sure why but I figured increased <br>
traffic to the area simply increases the likelihood that the letterbox is <br>
not rehidden well when they depart the area).  Most folks have no idea <br>
what a letterbox is and what it's for--they find it, remove it from the <br>
hiding spot, have no idea where it's supposed to be hidden since they <br>
don't have or know what the clues are and simply leave it out in full <br>
view or remove it as trash when they leave.  That's why good <br>
camouflage, great hiding spots and limited knowledge/exposure of the <br>
clues is such a good tactic.<br>

That's a very good point dvn2rckr.  Did you know that the clues in the Database can not be crawled by a search engine <br>
spider?  I can not speak for the LbNA site, but I'm sure they are using the same or similar database engine as I am. <br>
Anything written in a blog or LiveJournal or a forum, such as the forum you use and that I use can and is crawled by a <br>
search engines spider.  Which explains why some boxes are locatable via a search engine and most are not.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to share this trivia with ya dvn2rckr.  BTW, we're so looking forward to the upcoming event, we've got the <br>
stamp finished and the log book as well.  I think the log book is one of my better works. *(grin)*<br>

Just my two cents--you certainly can make a hybrid, but I wouldn't <br>
recommend it.  Many geocachers don't know about letterboxing, and <br>
mistakingly take the stamp or some other hienous crime.  In addition-<br>
-a lot of letterboxers aren't exactly fans of geocaching.  They'll <br>
deliberately avoid going to known hybrids.  And if you don't tell <br>
them it's a hybrid ahead of time, they'll likely be upset at not <br>
knowing about it and "wasting their" time chasing after a "stupid <br>
hybrid".<br>
<br>
Nobody ever complains about a lack of hybrids, but a good number <br>
will likely complain (even if only behind your back) if you start <br>
hiding hybrids.  You can do it, but don't expect the boxes to be <br>
very popular.<br>
<br>
Good luck!  =)<br>

 <br>
Speaking from personal experience, I recommend the letterbox and <br>
geocache be separated by at least 50 feet to avoid problems.  30 feet <br>
doesn't seem to be the magic distance anymore since the stamps &/or <br>
letterboxes continue to disappear (not sure why but I figured increased <br>
traffic to the area simply increases the likelihood that the letterbox is <br>
not rehidden well when they depart the area).  Most folks have no idea <br>
what a letterbox is and what it's for--they find it, remove it from the <br>
hiding spot, have no idea where it's supposed to be hidden since they <br>
don't have or know what the clues are and simply leave it out in full <br>
view or remove it as trash when they leave.  That's why good <br>
camouflage, great hiding spots and limited knowledge/exposure of the <br>
clues is such a good tactic.<br>
