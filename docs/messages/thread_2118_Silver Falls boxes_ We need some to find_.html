<br>
We will be heading up to Silver Falls this week early Friday morning.<br>
I thought this would be a perfect time to find all the boxes that are<br>
already there, before everyone else gets there and the gathering starts. <br>
<br>
But alas I can only find two!<br>
Buddah and Where, Oh Where, has Thanksgiving Day Gone?<br>
<br>
What are we going to do all day? I may only be able to get up there on<br>
Friday, and not Saturday, so I was wondering if anyone would let us<br>
find their boxes for the event a day in advance? I won't claim first<br>
finder on any of them, and I won't share the clues with anyone else<br>
but my letterboxing partner. <br>
<br>
I was also hoping that we could do our stamp exchanges Friday night. I<br>
am hoping people will be there! Is anyone else heading up earlier than<br>
Friday evening?<br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>
Becca<br>
