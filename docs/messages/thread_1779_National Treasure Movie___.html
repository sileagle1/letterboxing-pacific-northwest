This movie mentions letterboxing? that in itself makes it worth <br/>
watching :o) Its kind of funny how wide-known this sport is and yet <br/>
at the same time, little-known. Most people think I am talking about <br/>
mvoies when I mention letterboxing haha :o) I do get excited though <br/>
whenever i see something with the REAL letterboxing mentioned in it. <br/>
Our local lame news paper did an article on letterboxing last year <br/>
and much to my suprise the photographed log book they used was my <br/>
best friend Sandi's, she was even more suprised to see it :o) <br/>

&gt; This movie mentions letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
This movie DOES NOT mention letterboxing, however, with what they <br/>
are doing, it is like they are on a  fantastic letterboxing hunt!!  <br/>
You will have to see it to know that!!!!  The website does mention <br/>
letterboxing as an activity to do!!!  That was cool to me!!!<br/>
