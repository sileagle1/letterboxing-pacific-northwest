Hi,<br>
I'm just wondering if I was to organize a gathering at the end of <br>
August at riverside state park in Spokane, would there be anyone to <br>
come? I wanted to find out who would be interested before I reserve <br>
the camp ground. It will hold 60 people. For reservations as long as <br>
we have at least 20 people the fee is only $2 a person. Let me know <br>
if you are interested. heathersmom2000@earthlink.net <br>

WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE SPOKANE!!!  We just don't get many opportunities <br>
to get out that way--unless it's work related.  We'd be interested <br>
in attending (3 of us)--however, since it's not a Federal Holiday--<br>
then I can't confirm that we'll be able to attend until much closer <br>
to the event.  I have an idea some relatives in Boise may want to <br>
join in on the fun, too--if they're able--since it's sort of half <br>
way between us & them.  Ha ha!!!  (and I used to think New Orleans <br>
was about half way between Austin, TX and Panama City, FL!!!  You <br>
can always ask my husband about that pleasant moment in life--<br>
unfortunately, the joke was on me--after my 9 hour drive compared to <br>
his 3 hour drive when I learned the truth!!!)  C'est la vie!<br>

Riverside Park is a great place to camp. Plus, I already have two letterboxes hidden <br>
there! I usually go to Spokane sometime in September. Last year it was the second <br>
weekend. It would be unlikely for me to go twice within a month since it's a seven <br>
hour drive from my home. However, I would love to meet up with you when I am in <br>
town.<br>
<br>
If you peruse the members link on this List, you might find some other Spokane/<br>
Coeur d'Alene folks, like Hanglider, to contact. BTW Kim, your ISP thinks my emails <br>
are spam. I cannot write to you offlist using the email you have listed as your contact. <br>
I look forward to meeting you and your letterboxes. Funhog<br>

Hi,<br>
<br>
Replied directly to you via your Earthlink address but not sure the<br>
message made it to you...<br>
<br>
You can count on HangGlider & The Gardener for an August gathering in<br>
Spokane (except for possibly on a Saturday).<br>
