real job. (by the way if anyone knows of a writing/ copy editing <br/>
sort of job available please tell Wild Woman.)I made her take me out <br/>
for lunch for my birthday today. We started off at Powell's Books <br/>
but got lost after riding the transporter. So we left in seach of <br/>
something to eat and got a nice dish of Turtle Soup. We had a <br/>
wonderful time and I had a great birthday.<br/>
Hope you all had a great day too!<br/>
