The dogs scare the snakes away and Jenn can reach into any place that I won't just IN CASE there might be a snake!! I also always carry something with me to poke or prod or chop in case any critters come after me. As cool as that stamp is, Willow, I would have left it if that guy was protecting it!!<br/>

&gt; Well we went out for a quick trip to nab some of Pupp's boxes in the Dog <br/>
&gt; park last week here in Vancouver. My oldest daughter, Daisy, just loves <br/>
&gt; bugs, NOT. She lifted the mossy covered rock but to her eyes did behold a <br/>
&gt; black snake all coiled around the box. As she proceeded to jump back about <br/>
&gt; 10 feet away from the box, came mom to the rescue. Now I am not fond of <br/>
&gt; those critters either, but I grabbed a stick and prodded the little feller. <br/>
&gt; It did not move so I assumed that it was dead. I got it carefully under the <br/>
&gt; box and nabbed the box out just in case it was alive. As we thought we were <br/>
&gt; out just for a bit I had on my sturdy sandals but my girls had on those <br/>
&gt; lovely flip flops. So needless to say if that snake came toward any of us <br/>
&gt; the whole town would have seen and heard us running away. Daisy then <br/>
&gt; proclaimed that she was not coming near us to stamp in. I told her that she <br/>
&gt; had to or would not get the stamp, I am so mean. I kept looking into the <br/>
&gt; hole to make sure that the snake was still there as we stamped in. It was, <br/>
&gt; for the most part of the procedure. Then low and behold it was gone. Here <br/>
&gt; we go again. I kept hearing the song "I don't like spiders and snakes" <br/>
&gt; going over and over in my head. So here goes Daisy again in the 10 foot <br/>
&gt; range of the rock. So be forewarned about this box in the open field where <br/>
&gt; all can see. Willow, Daisey and Heartsey. <br/>
