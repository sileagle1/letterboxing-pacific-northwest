Does anyone know the whereabouts of Herman The Worm HH and Sweet <br/>
Hitch-a-hiker? I had left them in two letterboxes in the Southwest <br/>
Washington State area and have recently found out that they are no <br/>
longer in their hiding places. I have not heard back from anyone that <br/>
has found them nor have I heard if they were placed in a new <br/>
location. Please email me off site if you have run across either one <br/>
so my mind can be at ease. Thank you.<br/>

&gt; Welcome to the worrisome world of being a hitchhiker letterbox <br/>
&gt; parent...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We've planted approximately 10 hitchhiker letterboxes over the last <br/>
&gt; 15 months and I think we've heard updates on three of them--<br/>
possibly <br/>
&gt; 8 emails/messages posted to the traveller site total! I've written <br/>
&gt; my hitchhikers off--since it's been about 6 months since I even <br/>
&gt; heard an update on one of them.  Most likely they're still out <br/>
there <br/>
&gt; alive &amp; well--most people just don't bother/even know they <br/>
&gt; should/care to post the info on the message board or directly to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; placer.  If you know other folks who are active in letterboxing, <br/>
&gt; please spread the word that the traveller yahoo group message board <br/>
&gt; exists &amp; encourage them to post hitchhiker updates to that board.  <br/>
&gt; That's about all we can do to solve the problem.  As for some of <br/>
us, <br/>
&gt; when we come across hitchhikers, we attempt to post the info in the <br/>
&gt; logbook to the message board, just so the placers can see where <br/>
it's <br/>
&gt; been...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry about the frustration!<br/>

Oh My Goodness! I hope we don't have some kind of a Hitch Hiker <br/>
serial killer out there! Those were my first two babies and I am so <br/>
worried. Ok, calm down and breathe. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> As a newcomer to this world when we found our first hitchhiker we <br/>
weren't sure what we were supposed to do.We actually found 2 in one <br/>
box. I tried to look up and see what we should do about finding them <br/>
and didn't really get any answers. I did e-mail one person and let <br/>
them know we had found their hitchhiker but never heard back and then <br/>
on the other I didn't know who to contact. If there is a good <br/>
resource that I should know about for the future please let us <br/>
know.Or even letting the person know about the one we did find. <br/>
Thanks. <br/>
