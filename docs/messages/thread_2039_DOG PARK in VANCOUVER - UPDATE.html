TeamWARE went to the dog park in Vancouver to check out the status of the new fence and preparations to build a city park.  We can report that the temporary fence is NOT YET UP! However, all the markings are there for it to be erected.  Therefore - ANY boxes that require the searcher to use the 'BACK ENTRANCE" as a starting point will need to adjust their clues ASAP!!!!  I know that the 4DToes and their Animal Tracks series will need some adjustments - thus the reason I am posting this, in hopes everyone sees it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'd like to report on the status of several boxes that we checked on in hopes that the placers will see this.  All have been emailed but I"m not convinced that those emails are checked very often.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WANNA GO TO THE DOG PARK by KRIS is alive and well - dry - easy to find - and has plenty of room for signature stamps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ANIMAL TRACKS #1 by 4DToes is alive and well - dry - hidden in a slightly different spot than the clues indicate but the the box is now WELL hidden and won't be found accidentally.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CROSS MY HEART HOPE NOT TO DIE is in bad shape - wet - moldy - and virtually impossible to find if one has never been to this box.  The weeds, blackberry bushes and grass have grown and overgrown this entire area.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the next phase of letterboxing this spring and summer!!!!!<br/>

If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br/>
