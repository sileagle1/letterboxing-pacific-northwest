<br/>
This message is specific to your;<br/>
Beneath the Blue #2  #3  and  #4  LB's<br/>
<br/>
I'll start with the potential troubling news...<br/>
Beneath#2 at Beverly Beach State Park / Camping may be (reported) <br/>
missing. I spent the last day+ at the Park with no luck. It appears <br/>
there has been considerable erosion along the creek that runs through <br/>
this 'plant' area. Also some trees that were marked for cut have been <br/>
taken down as well as new growth areas added.  I will hope that out <br/>
of coincidence the area I was first drawn to for the find produced a <br/>
buried in dirt ziploc bag that was torn. No other 'evidence' of your <br/>
LB though so I'm hopeful that I simple missed, and you, or someone <br/>
else nearby can verify if it is still in place. I'll keep my fingers <br/>
crossed.<br/>
<br/>
Now for Beneath#3 at/near the Lighthouse - Cape Mears outside of <br/>
Tillamook. I didn't go after this one specifically. A friend took my <br/>
daughter, followed the clues and came upon a cache, with a camera and <br/>
trinkets.... they didn't take any pictures or trinkets and there <br/>
wasn't a note if the person who placed the cache had taken Beneath#3 <br/>
for repairs, or otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
And - Beneath #4. I recall you had mentioned to me in another <br/>
communication that you hadn't been contacted or updated on the <br/>
status/condition.  I am pleased to report that this box is alive and <br/>
well as of 5/25. Also, I was not the first - Hedgehog and ??Biscuit?? <br/>
had discovered Beneath#4 in March03. This one proved to be a <br/>
challenge for me, for some reason. Once found it all seemed so easy <br/>
(an hour later).  Ah sweet, sweet victory.  The Beneath#4 may be the <br/>
best carve I've acquired to date<br/>
<br/>
DID EVERYONE GET THAT???  If you're into a really nice carve Funhog <br/>
has outdone herself on Beneath#4, classy - very classy and fun. Nice <br/>
up-n-down trail, beautiful views - great day.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a  busy weekend...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm here to say that I found Funhog's Beverly Beach/Beneath the Blue #2 on <br/>
3-22--and I'll wager it's still there.  I had to work hard for that one-- the <br/>
trail was completely covered with water in places, but onward I slogged!!!  <br/>
&lt;<caution...hint ahead="" of="" sorts="">&gt;&gt; (And keep in mind that Funhog often makes you <br/>
work for your prize...the first place you might think matches the clues...well, <br/>
maybe so, maybe not.)  Even once I was in the correct vicinity, I was nearly <br/>
convinced it was missing, or that the compass reading was off, but I read <br/>
those darn clues again &amp; had another try--success!  <br/>
<br/>
I found a pretty little western red-backed salamander guarding this box, <br/>
which was as delightful as discovering a hitchhiker!  <br/>
<br/>
Have another go when you get the opportunity.  Like all Funhog's boxes, it's <br/>
worth the trek.<br/>

I was so disappointed this weekend not to find the beverley beach box, it was my first failure and crushing it was. We searched and searched in the rain reread the compass, walked the loop again looking for other potential sites...alas no luck. I hope it is not lost.Hedgehog<br/>
