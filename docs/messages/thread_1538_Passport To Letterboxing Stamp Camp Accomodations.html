                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp is fast approaching in a week <br/>
and all the campsites in the park are reserved. There is another <br/>
option for those of you that will be traveling from out of town but <br/>
can't book a campsite. The city of Battle Ground does not have a <br/>
hotel (go figure) but there are hotels in the surrounding area that <br/>
are within 20-30 minutes from the lake.<br/>
Holiday Inn Express 13101 NE 27th Ave. Salmon Creek (360) 576-1040<br/>
Red Lion Inn at Salmon Creek 1500 NE 134th Ave. (360) 566-1100<br/>
Salmon Creek Motel 11901 NE Hwy 99 Vancouver (360) 573-0751<br/>
Vancouver is a 30 minute drive from Battle Ground and has more hotels <br/>
and motels to choose from.<br/>
Email me at tinarie at msn dot com and I can get you more information.<br/>
I hope to see you all at the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp <br/>
August 27-29 at Battle Ground Lake in Battle Ground, WA. This will be <br/>
an event that you are not gonna want to miss!<br/>
