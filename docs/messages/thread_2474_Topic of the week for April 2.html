                    <div class="plaintext-content">Without a doubt, one of the tackiest themes I've encountered is Ryan's<br>
Crappy Stamp Letterbox. Back before the Mighty Tortuga was the wizard<br>
behind the curtain at AQ, he had quite a knack for stirring the pot on<br>
the Big List. (In fact he wasnt' even the Green Tortuga yet, still<br>
using his cheery, little purple spider sig stamp and calling himself<br>
"Ryan" of all things!) One of his more memorable displays of faulty<br>
tact was his less than favorable commentary on the letterbox stamps of<br>
the time that he had seen in the Seattle area. <br>
<br>
As he was bombarded with none-too-pleasant responses, he tried and<br>
tried to dig himself out of the mire. With each post he seemed to dig<br>
his hole deeper and deeper. I laughed harder at every subsequent<br>
message. Fortunately, he is more than able to laugh at himself (and<br>
his sense of tact) and as a result created this letterbox. Tacky it<br>
is, but the quality of Seattle area stamp carving DID improve vastly<br>
after The Green One made himself into Turtle Soup. BTW anyone gone for<br>
the RKOT box? Funhog <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know I've been racking my brain trying to come up with an idea <br>
for the tackiest or wackiest letterbox we've ever found and it's <br>
been difficult to come up with one.  Ryan's Crappy Stamp is up there <br>
at the top.  <br>
<br>
I'm thinking that there was a box that we found in a cemetery in CA <br>
that was up there, too.  It was in one of these 'hippy' type areas <br>
of a cemetery (not sure what you'd call it) but the area had all <br>
these sorts of 'bizarre' burial plots--some were ornately detailed <br>
with wrought iron, marble and stone, many many others seemed to have <br>
plastic trinkets, fake grass, foam boulders and other weird stuff <br>
you just wouldn't expect to see in a cemetery.  There were also lots <br>
of P-Patch types of gardens interspersed throughout the area with <br>
picnic tables and BBQ grills!  <br>
<br>
I don't remember the box all that much except that I think it had a <br>
goofy store bought stamp that had nothing to do with the area.  At <br>
the time I was thinking that the planter could have really gone hog-<br>
wild with that one--using the 'interesting' plots as inspiration for <br>
the clue and stamp or creating some mysterious story about a <br>
fictitious individual who is buried there.  It could have been a <br>
really incredible letterbox.  Now that I think about it, there was a <br>
geocache there, too--as I seem to recall lots of non-letterboxers <br>
having stamped into the log, too.<br>
