I liked the idea but then thought of those super hard mystery boxes, or the<br>
9 mile hikes a certain turtle we all know likes to plant boxes on. Should<br>
those not count until someone is brave/silly enough to actually try them?<br>

Thought for today: If a letter box in the woods sits and no one stamps in,<br>
is it still a letter box?   :-)   Ok, dumb... it's late.<br>

Hmmm....  That's an interesting theory.  =)  My planted count would<br>
certainly go down if that was the case.  None of my boxes in Africa or<br>
Central America would count.  But then, they aren't really in my<br>
backyard either.  ;o)<br>
<br>
I could probably count on one hand all the boxes I've planted in the<br>
states that haven't been found yet.  Even the most remote,<br>
inaccessible crags where I've planted boxes have had someone brave and<br>
daring enough to go after them.  One of them even required a 20+ mile<br>
backpacking trip to reach, and I was absolutely floored when I got a<br>
report that it was found!<br>
<br>
So make this a lesson: No matter how inaccessible or crazy your boxes<br>
are, there's always someone out there crazier than you are and will go<br>
out to look for it.  =)<br>
