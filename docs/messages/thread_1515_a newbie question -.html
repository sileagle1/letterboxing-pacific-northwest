                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there Kathy -- <br>
<br>
Der Mad Stamper actually was from around here - he was one of the first<br>
Pioneers of letterboxing in this area.  For unknown reasons he has sort of<br>
dropped out of the letterboxing community however and is not contactable,<br>
reachable or active in this area any longer.  Hence the reason people are<br>
adopting his boxes.<br>
<br>
The adopting boxes thing is a rather new thing as Green Hornet was saying<br>
earlier and to be quite honest, is something I am not sure I totally agree<br>
with. Adopting his boxes in the Tualatin District was a necessity per the<br>
instructions of Kyle Spinks who works for THPRD however outside of that, I<br>
know I personally do not want my boxes adopted. I have several boxes in CA<br>
that were planted there before I moved.  They have recently come up missing<br>
and or incomplete and quite honestly, I will mark the boxes as retired, and<br>
those who got them the year they were there got them, those that didn't well<br>
sorry that is part of the game.<br>
<br>
Some people feel differently I am sure, some people mark their boxes as<br>
orphans and ask for others to adopt them, I've seen Bethany and Don and Gwen<br>
do it -- I think in that case it's totally cool - if the placer is<br>
contactable and asking for assistance and you want to help right on. However<br>
in this case the boxes in questions can get no permissions from the original<br>
placer and hold a significant amount of history to the letterboxing<br>
community, which gets very passionate about things at times, and personally<br>
outside of the THPRD area, I would suggest leaving the boxes alone, in an<br>
effort to not piss anyone off. When this originally came up I thought it was<br>
awesome that people wanted to preserve history, but seeing the uproar it<br>
caused and how upset Lily got, perhaps it's just not a good idea. But that<br>
again is just my opinion, everyone else has to make up their own mind.<br>
<br>
That's just my two cents,<br>

Ok I'm a newbie and I've seen the name Der Mad stamper, but with all <br>
the talk about him lately I've got to ask... who is he?  I'm assuming <br>
he isn't from around here if others are adopting his boxes.  Just <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gosh, I'm not sure I can do an adequate introduction but I'll give it a try. When <br>
letterboxing first started in the US, there was a small group of people whose interest <br>
was piqued by an article in Smithsonian magazine, April '98. After months of poking <br>
around on the internet, a half dozen or so found each other. <br>
<br>
Luckily for us in the PNW two of these people lived here in Portland, Thom Cheney <br>
(Green Hornet) and Mitch Klink (Der Mad Stamper.) Green Hornet hid Oregon's first <br>
box and probably the first on the West Coast. DMS is a wonderful carver and was a <br>
prolific letterbox hider in the early days. He hid the first boxes in many other states <br>
as well. <br>
<br>
Early on, they were the only two letterboxers in the area. They hid box after box for <br>
each other to find. Some of these gems are still out there! Mitch was also the person <br>
responsible for the original LbNA web site and it's his old timey graphics that you see <br>
whenever you go to that site today. In recent years, the site has undergone some <br>
wonderful updates but DMS's tutorials are still there in all their inspirational glory.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Mitch has faded from the local letterboxing scene. Thom is still around <br>
but has a very full plate, so he hasn't hidden many boxes of late. However, he's <br>
lurking as we speak and I hope that we see some of his rad-cool stamps in another <br>
box soon. Hear me, Green Hornet? Get out there and hide 'em! <br>
<br>
So that's my version of a quickie history lesson. Anyone else, feel free to add <br>
on...Funhog<br>
