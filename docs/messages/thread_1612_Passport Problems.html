I would just get a new passport. If you mail your application in, within a<br>
week or two your new passport will arrive. It's pretty easy if you mail in<br>
your expired passport.<br>
<br>
Most post offices have the paperwork or one can download it from the<br>
internet thingy. Then there are regional passport offices available if you<br>
need to go in person. Just make sure you send in 2 photos of yourself that<br>
match the required demensions. If it's your first passport, I think you<br>
have to go in person with the required birth certificate. If you don't have<br>
that, it's a bit more complicated. See the passport's webpage for those<br>
details.<br>
<br>
Once you have your valid passport, it shows absolute proof of who you are<br>
(which is a good thing in these times).<br>

===============<br>
<br>
I'm going to give it my best shot to make it to the Canadian T-Day Event.<br>
Will have to see about time off from work, but  that shouldn't be a<br>
problem. Hopefully it will be a go!<br>

It only took about ten days for my last two passports to arrive, even<br>
though the time line quoted is 4  to 6 weeks. But you never know for sure.<br>
