<br>
I took off the site both Resident Flutterby (mystery box) and An Inuit Sun (a <br>
box along the Audubon trails).  Both are missing.  They were good while they <br>
lasted, eh?  I only regret that I didn't get to see the logs of either <br>
letterboxes . . .  I'm wondering if we should have a memorial service?<br>

PS  Thanks to Funhog and Krnzintermittent for the heads up that one or <br>
t'other might be missing.<br>

I will forever laugh at myself and Wild Woman when I think how <br>
obsessed we were to find Flutterby in June. I can remember in detail <br>
how we dropped everything and returned the next day after relizing <br>
we were in the exact location, but could not find the correct box. <br>
We had so many things we really needed to do, but we HAD TO GET THAT <br>
BOX!!!!!!!<br>
Thanks again for the fun hunt.<br>
