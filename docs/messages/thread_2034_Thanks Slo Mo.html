I'm going to Columbia today.<br>
I called this a.m. and asked the gal about prices and<br>
she seemed perplexed with what I was using and how I<br>
am going to use it.  She didn't feel my combination is<br>
a safe one which is strange because these tools are<br>
the one Pandora used and sold to us at Stamp Camp. <br>
I'm completely comfortable using these tools with my<br>
girl scouts.....HUMPH! LOL  I'm bringing a sample in<br>
so the gal can rest easy knowing no one will be<br>
missing appendages before the night is through.<br>
<br>
Thanks again.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I did block carving in junior high, we worked with lino block that's a lot tougher than the stuff used for letterbox stamps.  It was a very tough, rust-colored rubber about an eighth of an inch thick, mounted on a sort of burlap weave.  We heated it with an iron, even, to make it a little easier to carve.  With something so tough to work with, it was easier (even with the same, reasonably safe tools I have now) for the tool to suddenly come loose, overshoot, and gouge a little "v" shape in your hand.  If she doesn't know about making little stamps like we do, and more familiar with print-making with that kind of lino block, I can see why she would be concerned.  Carving something as soft as an eraser is definitely easier!  If she still worries, not much can be done...<br>
