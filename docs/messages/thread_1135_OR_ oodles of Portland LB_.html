<br/>
Started off at Marshall Park (I lived here ten years and didn't know<br/>
about this park!). #5 seems to be MIA, I'll confirm with the placer,<br/>
but all others were in great shape. A delightful family collection.<br/>
<br/>
PCC Sylvania wore us out, but we got all three, all in good shape (if<br/>
not lonely), though #1 was a bit soggy, and was in need of a new<br/>
baggie and letterboxing 'handouts'. We gave it a baggies, but it needs<br/>
new flyers...<br/>
<br/>
On the way home, we picked up Little People and God Bless the USA (we<br/>
were the second ones there today), and the rain started in earnest.<br/>
USA is fine, despite construction just a few feet away.<br/>
<br/>
Wow! 10 for 11! Thanks to all who planted, we had a ball. Now for some<br/>
birthday cake (my brother's)!<br/>
<br/>
Celt et al.<br/>
