It is tough for me to schedule anything for any weekend in June.  <br/>
That is Graduation Season and my company provides interactive <br/>
games for lots of school events that time of year.  I most likely <br/>
will be working both days that weekend.  However, since it is so <br/>
close to home and work, I would probably be able to stop in for at <br/>
least a short time. The rest of the Nail Family could certainly <br/>
make it so go ahead and schedule for that weekend if you can.  <br/>
Sunday is a better bet for us altogether.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
.  Just trying to figure out a <br/>
&gt; date--looking at 14 or 15 June possibly.  Just waiting to verify <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; more required event for us--if we can swing this, there might <br/>
be a <br/>
&gt; rare 'trkee' sighting in the area!  ;)  Any interest in a 14/15 June <br/>
&gt; Olympia (Puget Sound) letterboxing event?<br/>
