<br>
Well, I'm heading down to Oxbow to camp and make paper with friends and do a <br>
little letterboxing.  Not that I expect anything to hinge on me, but IF <br>
anybody wanted to meet up, or IF you needed a reason for a party (yeah, <br>
right), here's my schedule:<br>
<br>
Coming down from Seattle area Thursday, August 3 early.  Set up camp, <br>
letterboxing, set up pulpatorium in the late afternoon.<br>
Friday, August 4 - papermaking<br>
Saturday, August 5 - papermaking<br>
Sunday, August 6 - cleanup and leave pulpatorium in the morning.  Afternoon <br>
and evening letterboxing<br>
Monday, August 7 - letterboxing<br>
Tuesday, August 8 - Take trip up the gorge to Montana.<br>
<br>
Y'all had asked me to let you know when I knew what I was up to.  Can't <br>
wait!  No Legend, so I can hike as long and as far as I want to, so there! <br>
As long as I'm physically able to, that is, which probably eliminates the <br>
mountaintop ones...some other day...:0P<br>
<br>
Thunderbird<br>
<br>
P.S. - does anybody have any recommendations about whether the drive is <br>
prettier/better up the Washington side or the Oregon side?  I've never done <br>
it, and have no idea.<br>

when it gets closer to your visit. This post might get lost in the <br>
shuffle.<br>
I would recommend coming up on the Oregon side of the Gorge. There <br>
aren't any bridges over the Gorge to get to the other side when you <br>
get towards the Oxbow Park/Troudale area and if you were to travel <br>
on the Washington side, you would have to go way out of the way to <br>
get across. Take the I-205 south to I-84 towards Troutdale.<br>
Looking forward to seeing you again!<br>

Oh, gosh, that's a tough question. They're both astonishingly<br>
beautiful, but in very different ways. The Oregon side tends to be<br>
clouded in shade most of the time, while the Washington side basks in<br>
the warm sun. The Oregon side has a heck of a lot more interesting<br>
waterfalls, but the Washington side seems more of a 'stop to smell the<br>
flowers' feel since it's not on an Interstate.<br>
<br>
It's a tough call. I often make a loop out of it and drive up one side<br>
then come back on the other, but if you're heading all the way out to<br>
Montana, that's probably not an option for you.<br>
<br>
You can hit both sides by switching sides at Cascade Locks or a bridge<br>
somewhere around The Dalles. If you do drive the Oregon side, I'd<br>
definitely suggest using the Old Columbia River Scenic Highway (did I<br>
get the name right?) instead of the Interstate as far as you can,<br>
though. Much nicer than the Interstate. *nodding*<br>
<br>
As a whole, I also think there are more letterboxes on the Oregon side<br>
to choose from. =)<br>
