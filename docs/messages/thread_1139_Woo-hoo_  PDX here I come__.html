have gotten our respective husbands to agree to watch the kids for <br>
the morning. So...bright and early (5-ish) we are hitting the road <br>
south to Portland! Alas, due to a family commitment I can't get out <br>
of (my niece is getting baptized) Saturday evening we must leave <br>
Portland no later than 1pm. <br>
<br>
So..us two can meet you all where ever breakfast is going to be or at <br>
a specific spot. It will take us approx 2 hours or so to get to <br>
Portland from Tacoma.  We may even plant a mystery box enroute. I <br>
scouted out a perfect spot on my trip to Portland in January!<br>
<br>
Can't wait for Saturday!! WooHoo!! <br>

Well...we plan on hitting the road by 5am. Since we are limited by a <br>
1pm latest departure time from Portland we figured we'd try to get a <br>
morning of letterboxing done down there in LB heaven!  So...we are <br>
open and I'll defer to you the Portland tourguide for guidance. Just<br>
give me a time and place and I'll run a "mapquest" search for exact <br>
directions. <br>
<br>
Let me know what boxes you think we should try for Saturday morning <br>
and I'll go ahead and run off a set of clues here. We <br>
enjoy "powerboxing" ...aka...the most boxes for our time!! It may be <br>
a couple more months before we get down south again.<br>
<br>
So...breakfast can be where ever jsut let me know what time you all <br>
will be ready. I can always fill time by hitting a box or two while <br>
we wait. (MomNoTime wants to hit Smith & Bybee and a particular <br>
mystery box.)<br>
<br>
So..what do you think?<br>

Rose by any other Name, Swan Lake, and Healthy Living Oregon are all within<br>
just a few miles.  Oops not to mention You Betcha and What Can I Get You.<br>
