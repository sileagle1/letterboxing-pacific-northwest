                    <div class="plaintext-content">I believe the goose box IS indeed missing, I had found it a couple <br/>
months back, and it is not in the same location, or anywhere near as <br/>
of yesterday....  Maybe it could be hand carved and replaced?  It's <br/>
in such a nice park, and the frog park box we couldn't find, checked <br/>
all trees nearby and then some, did find a yellow jacket nest, and <br/>
some really stinky goose poop hitched a ride home on my tennis <br/>
shoe... (ewe!) Looks like the grass had been recently cut around the <br/>
trees and some gardening had been done.  Also... Another one we <br/>
couldn't find was the new "Noodle Me" box in Beaverton..... We did <br/>
find a TON of POISON IVY instead!  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the owners of these boxes could do a check and update us?  <br/>

Message: <br/>
We have gone to multiple letterboxes close around tualatin tigard and <br/>
beaverton, every one we go to, all the boxes are missing.... I think <br/>
there is a little butthead going around stealing all the boxes! Maybe <br/>
you can put up a notice or send out an email stating this so everyone <br/>
checks their planted ones....<br/>
