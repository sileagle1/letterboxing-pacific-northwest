Hi there - not sure if this has already been noted and discussed, but I<br/>
was just looking through the latest PDX Magazine and saw that they<br/>
devoted 2 pages to an article on letterboxing. It covered the "basics,"<br/>
but unfortunately left out some really important aspects that make<br/>
letterboxing what it is...just one example, it says that you should<br/>
bring a rubber stamp, but doesn't say anything about carving your own,<br/>
nor does it give credit to all of the beautiful, creative hand-carved<br/>
stamps out there.<br/>
<br/>
Although the author gives the usual disclosure about discretion, I<br/>
personally was disappointed by the overall article. PDX Magazine is a<br/>
freebie, and while it's very nicely done compared to a lot of other<br/>
freebies, it's basically a glossy hipster's guide to the ultratendy<br/>
hotspots in Portland. They give it away at local hotels, bars, shops,<br/>
etc. I just hope it attracts some new boxers who take the sport<br/>
seriously, and that we don't see an increase in missing boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read this online. Seems the writer must be dyslexic. The date for<br/>
the famed Smithsonian article is listed as 1989 not 1998. I agree it's<br/>
sad they missed the art aspect of the hobby since that is one of the<br/>
main draws for me. I do think they got it right when they described<br/>
geocaching second to letterboxing. We've been around lots longer,<br/>
after all. Thanks for the heads up. Funhog<br/>
