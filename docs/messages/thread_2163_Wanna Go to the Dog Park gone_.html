looked at it for a while I thought I'd check up on my box hidden <br>
there.  I had to search around for it and was most disappointed to <br>
find the lid and the box open and empty except for a few (thankfully <br>
unused) poop bags.  The stamp, log book, and extra leash were gone.  <br>
Sigh.  Another one bites the dust.  I do not plan to replace this<br>
box, <br>
so if you have the clues printed out somewhere, toss 'em.  <br>
<br>
To add injury to insult, I got stuck by a stupid blackberry bush and <br>
now I have a thorn in my index finger that I can't get out.  What a <br>
day.<br>
