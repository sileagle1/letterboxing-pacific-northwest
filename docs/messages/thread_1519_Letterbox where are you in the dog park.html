The person who found this box vandalized is giving the container back to me. I am retaining the box and name and will be replacing the stamp with another of the same theme. The first stamp was one of my firsts and the new one is better. Not sure when it'll be up, things are hectic at work right now. <br>

How was it vandalized though?  Meaning someone defaced<br>
the stamp? or ruined the book? or what?  I FREAKED<br>
when I read that because this was my kids FIRST FIND<br>
and so they feel an attachment to it.  I've shared<br>
this information with them and they are upset too.  It<br>
was a great hiding place....<br>

I just received the box and the log book back. I have a better idea about what happened to it now. I'm thinking that someone new didn't hid it well after stamping in. There are 3 or 4 pages of my own stamp stamped into it with notes that it was the first find for the group. Scooby seems to be lost. I have another stamp for the box though. <br>
