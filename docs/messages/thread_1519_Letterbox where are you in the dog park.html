The person who found this box vandalized is giving the container back to me. I am retaining the box and name and will be replacing the stamp with another of the same theme. The first stamp was one of my firsts and the new one is better. Not sure when it'll be up, things are hectic at work right now. <br/>

&gt; Oh No! <br/>
&gt; First of all, I'm a Newbie and I treasure every box I <br/>
&gt; find and leave it in the same state I found it along <br/>
&gt; with my stamp. Every box I've found since I started <br/>
&gt; two weeks ago was in tact, hidden well, and I returned <br/>
&gt; the favor. And then yesterday I retrieved the Lacamas <br/>
&gt; Creek box, which was orphaned, to restore it and that <br/>
&gt; is complete and ready to be replanted with a few <br/>
&gt; surprises inside. So I know I don't fall into the <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, I want to express my disdain when I went to <br/>
&gt; find the "Letterbox Where Are You" last night. I was <br/>
&gt; trucking through the dog park at 8:3 0 p.m. (which, <br/>
&gt; after the whole scenario at Hamburger Hamburger <br/>
&gt; Cheeseburger you think I wouldn't have done this <br/>
&gt; alone, but I did). Anyway, I got out of my Monday <br/>
&gt; night final exam REALLY early...rescued Lacamas Creek <br/>
&gt; then headed to the dog park in Vancouver. Was able to <br/>
&gt; stamp in at two books my children had already stamped <br/>
&gt; in at...however, when going to get the third one, <br/>
&gt; which was OUR FIRST ONE to find...it was GONE! I was <br/>
&gt; hurt. It was dark and I searched forever only to <br/>
&gt; realize it's gone. Got home, went online and sure <br/>
&gt; enough, the placer says the box had been vandalized. <br/>
&gt; Now WHO would do that? I thought only letterboxers <br/>
&gt; look at the sights and find the clues...then I <br/>
&gt; realized, with so much advertising lately that anyone <br/>
&gt; can go on the site and read the clues and be <br/>
&gt; malicious. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very Sad. I left the Dog Park feeling em pty because <br/>
&gt; I'd missed out on a VERY COOL stamp. <br/>

I just received the box and the log book back. I have a better idea about what happened to it now. I'm thinking that someone new didn't hid it well after stamping in. There are 3 or 4 pages of my own stamp stamped into it with notes that it was the first find for the group. Scooby seems to be lost. I have another stamp for the box though. <br/>
