it happens to his Yahoo groups also. I have various Yahoo groups, some for<br/>
quite a few years, but all this started happening in the fall and has<br/>
happened four or five times since that time. It is kind of frustrating. I<br/>
don't think it has anything to do with the group, I think it is a Yahoo<br/>
problem.<br/>

Subject: Question for yahoo Owner or Moderator<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HI! For some reason I keep getting kicked out of the group and yahoo<br/>
says that my email adress is invalid and that it is "Bouncing" and<br/>
then asks me to respond to an email from yahoo sent to my supposedly<br/>
inactive email adress to reactivate my account. So far this has<br/>
happened 4 times. Any explanations might be helpful. I havent changed<br/>
my email adress in 8 years and I recieve the emails from yahoo so I<br/>
am stumped as too why it says I am "Bouncing" and need to reactivate<br/>
my account continuously.<br/>

Wow that was alot of replies! Thanks everyone for the information :o) <br/>
I never have a full email box so I assume it must be just that I have <br/>
an hotmail account like Ryan said. I will try to figure out how to <br/>
change my adress to my yahoo mail (which I have never used haha) so <br/>
maybe that will help. I was almost worried (paranoid i guess haha) <br/>
that I may have made someone mad and I was getting kicked out for <br/>
that reason because it didnt make sense to me why it was repeatedly <br/>
happening, good to know I didnt make anyone mad enough to <br/>
intentionally kick me out of the group (woohoo!)  :o) I guess I am <br/>
one of those nerdy people thats always paranoid of offending people. <br/>
Again, Thanks for all the replies :o) I appreciate it :o) <br/>

Oh, heck no!  We wouldn't have even known you were getting booted if<br/>
you didn't speak up.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Having used both Hotmail and Yahoo, I much prefer the Yahoo account. <br/>
Hotmail has been a problem for me for YEARS.  A lot of computers in<br/>
Central America refused to work at all with Hotmail.  And it runs SOOO<br/>
slowly I've gotten over colds before a page loads up.  The spam filter<br/>
I think does a better job of catching just spam and *only* spam.<br/>
<br/>
I can't understand why anyone would stick with Hotmail unless they<br/>
just don't want to give up the e-mail address or work for that<br/>
diabolical company and want to support it.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Might take some getting used to, but in the end, I suspect you'll be<br/>
quite happy with the service from Yahoo!  At least compared to what<br/>
Hotmail has to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
