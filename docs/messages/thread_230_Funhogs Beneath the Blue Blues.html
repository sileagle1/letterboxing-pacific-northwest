As for great carvings, you can never go wrong with a Funhog letterbox.<br>
Got to see about those other Beneath the Blue boxes sometime, but it may<br>
be a while before we get on down to certain parts of the Coast.  <br>

<br>
I'm glad, in some respects, to hear that I'm not the only one that <br>
had challenges with BtB#2. We also picked up your Devils Lake Park <br>
LB. It was waterlogged pretty bad and someone had added a new log <br>
book, so it is in fair condition overall.  <br>
<br>
Happy Monday<br>

First is figuring out exactly the right spot.  Several places along the way you think, 'Ah, this is it!', but it wasn't.  Keep going....<br>
<br>
Parts of the trail were rather waterlogged as well, which made the hike itself more difficult than anticipated.<br>
<br>
And even when I did get to the right place, I kept thinking that I must have done something wrong, because Funhog NEVER places a letterbox so far off the trail.  But she did....  =)<br>
<br>
And FINALLY, when I did find the box, it was half burried by eroded setiments and I actually had to dig it out to extract it from it's spot.  I would NOT be surprised if it's completely burried by now.  Bring a good sharp stick and poke around and see if you strike burried treasure.<br>
<br>
I sincerely doubt the box was missing--it was so covered by sediment that I had trouble finding it even when I was looking for it.  I can't imagine anyone found it by accident!<br>
