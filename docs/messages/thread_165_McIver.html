see how these groups are any greater threat to letterboxes than anyone<br/>

They do tend to avoid trails, but at least where the reenactment took place, people were camped EVERYWHERE and during the reenactment itself, they'll likely find boxes in spots you'd never think anyone would look in.  It's only one small section of the park this takes place, but I won't ever be hiding letterboxes in that area!<br/>
