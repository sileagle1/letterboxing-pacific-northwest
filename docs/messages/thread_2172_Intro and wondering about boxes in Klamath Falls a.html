                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings fellow letter boxers! My seven year old son and I have gone <br>
crazy letter boxing this last month. We love it - great to get out and <br>
keep active. We've found about 25 and planted 4. Thanks for all the <br>
great fun boxes out there in the Portland area! We are planning this <br>
trip next weekend so I did a search and only came up with 2 (Gilchrist <br>
and Phantom Ship) boxes to hunt for. Does anyone know of any others in <br>
striking range? Or drive bys that you would recommend along the route <br>
from Portland to Klamath. I believe I was told we would cut over around <br>
Springfield. This is a pretty quick trip so they would have to be <br>
pretty handy - not a long drive or hike.<br>
Thanks in advance for any help!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you go over Mt. Hood instead of down I-5 there are <br>
quite a few along the way. I know there are a lot<br>
around Eugene but I have done little boxing <br>
in that area and don't know much about what's down <br>
there. If you cross over at Roseburg, there are several <br>
boxes on that route as well. <br>
<br>
Since Crater Lake is a National Park, letterboxes are <br>
verboten. If there are any other boxes in that park, <br>
they are likely to be ones that have only word of mouth <br>
clues. I am surprised that the Phantom Ship is still listed <br>
publicly. Down towards Klamath Falls on Highway 97 <br>
there used to be a box at Collier State Park but I don't <br>
know about its current status.<br>
<br>
South Central Oregon has a distinct shortage of letterboxes. <br>
Perhaps this will be more of a planting opportunity than a <br>
finding adventure. I suppose this is just about no help at all <br>
but good luck and have fun! Funhog<br>
