to attend the gathering on March 12th in Gresham, Oregon. just 2 weeks away<br/>
now, the time has come to put your name in to the pot!  Never attended a<br/>
gathering? Well today is the day to start! <br/>
<br/>
This is a very family friendly event. We will have a room to ourselves so we<br/>
can spread out and enjoy ourselves without worrying about being overheard or<br/>
the kids wandering off. The location also has a pool table, air hockey, and<br/>
a few video games for those family members that may not be as enamored of<br/>
our little game as we are! <br/>
<br/>
So far I've gotten RSVP's for lots of folks, many from out of town. I hope<br/>
to see YOU there as well. <br/>
<br/>
Don't miss your chance to be a part of the fun and possibly collect 22+ new<br/>
stamps!<br/>
