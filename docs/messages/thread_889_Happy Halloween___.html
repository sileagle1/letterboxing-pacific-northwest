shirt with a black cat and the moon on it and carve a pumpkin with a<br>
cat's face.  That was about it.  <br>
<br>
Man, has the temperature dropped OR WHAT!!!  The pineapple express has<br>
certainly left Oregon and gone back to Hawaii.  Part of me would like to<br>
go get Mark and Beth's exciting Halloween series this weekend and part<br>
of me wants to curl up by the fire and carve, while doing laundry (a hot<br>
chore), cooking (another hot chore) or watching movies checked out from<br>
the library.  Anyone know if "Emma" and "Being John Malkovich" are any<br>
good?  I haven't seen either?<br>
<br>
I may venture out, but it is doubtful.  Meanwhile, my letterboxing will<br>
probably be done in my head!<br>

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but libraries generally don't <br>
keep very "hot" movies around, but I'm sure you can find those at <br>
your local video store.  ;o)<br>
<br>
Oh, wait, have you seen 'Some Like It Hot'?  Excellent movie and now <br>
seems like an appropriate time to watch it.  =)<br>
<br>
Of course, flame wars on the talk lists can warm things up <br>
considerably too.<br>
<br>
Oh, of all the ways one can stay warm!  It staggers the imagination!  <br>
