My parents have paid for me to fly out to visit them, my Uncle, my grandmother and my brother. I'll only get one short evening with my brother then drive down to my parents place for the week -- they live near the small town of Wimer, Oregon near Rogue River.<br>
<br>
I will have some time closer to Portland at the end of my trip & Murray Herd is hosting a gathering on the 22nd.<br>
<br>
Here's the link to the gathering, hope to see you there. http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2636<br>

Thanks - I look forward to seeing old friends and meeting new faces next week,<br>
