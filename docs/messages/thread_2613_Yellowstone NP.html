about the experience.  What an amazing place.  (Only, Mammoth Hot <br/>
Springs was largely dry so not as spectacular as it usually is).  <br/>
Canyon was absolutely awesome.  Worth every minute spent there.  Old <br/>
Faithful area is just loaded with people by late-morning, but get <br/>
there early (daybreak) and you'll have a few hours without them.  And <br/>
a good parking space.  The thermal features at Old Faithful are just <br/>
amazing.  West Thumb thermal area was also incredible, just a bit <br/>
smaller than the other areas.  We camped in 3 different areas and <br/>
attended the ranger-talks each night at the amphitheaters, where we <br/>
learned more history and details about Yellowstone.  We saw deer and <br/>
elk (being from the PNW that's a bit routine); moose; bats; some sort <br/>
of wild ferret; the typical chipmunks and ground squirrels; numerous <br/>
birds including osprey, bald eagle, huge ravens, small colorful <br/>
sparrow-type birds, small killdeer-type shorebirds, herons, swans, a <br/>
couple cranes? I think; and we experienced the quintessential traffic <br/>
jam caused by a herd of buffalo, taking their sweet time wandering <br/>
among the cars.  What massive animals. <br/>
<br/>
I picked up several boxes on the way to and from Yellowstone, and <br/>
every one of them were exceptional carvings, with related themes that <br/>
made them just as much souvenirs of the trip as anything I bought in a <br/>
gift shop.  If you are ever headed to Yellowstone, be sure to email me <br/>
and I'll be happy to point out some must-have boxes. My thanks to <br/>
everyone who suggested boxes to visit.<br/>
