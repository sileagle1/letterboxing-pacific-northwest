I've made a request to the webmaster of www.letterboxing .org to adopt several boxes in the Washington area.  I'm going to post those boxes here as well in the hopes that if anyone 'owns' them, they'll contact either myself or the website.  The boxes that Team Rayvenhaus are going to be maintaining are:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      Forest Runner  AbandonedBox  1 ???, WA  <br/>
      Mt. Rainer/Comet Falls  AbandonedBox  1 Ashford, WA  <br/>
      Elbe Train  AbandonedBox  1 Elbe?, WA  <br/>
      Where are the Clowns?  AbandonedBox  1 Lakewood, WA  <br/>
      SSLF Finish Line  AbandonedBox  1 Lakewood, WA  <br/>
      Foothills Trail Series  AbandonedBox  3 Orting, WA  <br/>
      Catch Me  AbandonedBox  1 Puyallup, WA  <br/>
      Spanaway Lake  AbandonedBox  1 Spanaway , WA <br/>
<br/>
      Tolmie State Park  AbandonedBox  2 Lacy, WA  <br/>
      Kenneydell Park  AbandonedBox  1 Olympia, WA  <br/>
      Zug-wa Monster  AbandonedBox  1 Tumwater, WA <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the offer, but Kenneydell Park is in the same situation as dvn2r ckr's Tolmie and Zug-wa, they were put on the trial site and are still there.  I asked to have Kenney and Dell transferred to me, but they weren't so I added the link to my website page for them on the new LbNA page and waiting for them to be removed from the abandoned box list so they will go away.  Checked on them June 6th, they are fine, but lonely :-(  Found Cup O' Joe there, as noted earlier.  It is now available for locating at a box near you (or maybe not so near, but in the area.<br/>
