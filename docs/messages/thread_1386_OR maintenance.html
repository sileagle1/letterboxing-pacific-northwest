I also replaced the What's for Dinner #4 a few days ago. A quick stop by Sleight <br>
showed it to be waiting for future visitors as well. Ace of Fun, unfortunately, is on <br>
sabbatical until future notice. I've also heard that Beneath the Blue #4 may be missing <br>
from a highly credible source. I won't be out there to check on it for quite a while but <br>
be forewarned. <br>

The Transplanted Cowboys and Wingnut's crew will be on the northern <br>
coast in a few weeks.  I'll try to look for the Beneath the Blue #3 <br>
& #4 as well.  <br>

<br>
The highly credible source says that the last time the Cape Falcon <br>
box was checked up on was January 31, 2002.  At that time, the box <br>
was well, but it's dated information and 'things change'.<br>
