this box was missing.  I checked on it tonight, and it's there where<br>
it's supposed to be.  From the person's description it sounded like<br>
they were in the right spot, maybe just didn't look hard enough.  It<br>
was fun looking through the log book; a couple of 35-mph couch<br>
potatoes had been there - too funny!<br>

P.S.  Sophie really has been clocked going 35-mph.  At one of our race meets<br>
last year a couple of Molalla policemen were eating lunch right by Clark<br>
Park where we run.  The line judges (people at the end of the race who say<br>
what order the dogs finish) struck up a conversation with them and asked<br>
them if their radar gun could pick up whippets.  They didn't know, but gave<br>
it a try and clocked the dogs over the finish line at 36-mph.  Sophie just<br>
happened to be in that race, and won it, too.  That's my girl!!<br>
