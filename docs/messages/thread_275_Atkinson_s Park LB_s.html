But was pleased to get FUN GUY. I must say I was interested to see the warning from wild woman regarding an attack in that park.  While there I kept a close eye on the only other person in the park who appeared too interested in my presence to make me entirely comfortable; had not the fierce and ferocious " See Biscuit" been with me I would have aborted the hunt.<br>

nearby, I'm thinking that some kids got together there, partied, and <br>
unfortunately must have found the box.  I'm not going to replace it now, but may in the <br>
future at a different location.<br>
