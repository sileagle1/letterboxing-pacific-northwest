On another topic - sort of last weeks - Miniles and I met yesterday to exchange <br/>
some postals and somehow got on the topic:<br/>
<br/>
when boxing in the wild sometimes we wonder if the box is missing or maybe <br/>
someone else just has the box for signing in.<br/>
<br/>
When you've gone a long way and doubt you'll be back to the area or it was a <br/>
long hike you'd hate to give up / leave only to find out that someone logged in <br/>
that day and you left because you thought it was MIA.<br/>
<br/>
Miniles mentioned that she'd heard someone say they have a laminated card <br/>
that they leave in the place of the box that says they are signing in and it will <br/>
be back shortly.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a wonderful idea and wanted to spread it to as many as possible!<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be great to leave one if you take the box for maintenance too - <br/>
that way we can just go on our merry way looking for the next box instead of <br/>
stalling or wasting our precious letterboxing daylight/time coming back to <br/>
recheck.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it doesn't sound like I'm negative or complaining - I don't mean to be - I <br/>
just wanted to pass on this idea because I hadn't heard of it or thought of it in <br/>
the 7 mos. I've been boxing and I think this would be really nice/helpful for all <br/>
of us if everyone adds these 2 little cards to their important things to carry list!<br/>
 :-)<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

LadyB, I think that's a great idea - I have a sheet of things on my<br/>
desk waiting to go to the laminator, and I'm going to include a couple<br/>
of blurbs to get laminated and carry with me.  Often when I sign in I<br/>
have to go around a corner or around a bend or a ways off to find a<br/>
dry place to sit.  Might even prevent missing out on a chance for an<br/>
exchange.  <br/>
