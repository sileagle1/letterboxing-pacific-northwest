                    <div class="plaintext-content">This weekend marks our most successful LB adventures!  Of course, we <br/>
still are newbies, and therefore do not have many to boast of yet.<br/>
<br/>
We started the weekend Friday afternoon with the Rood Bridge <br/>
collection.  Got 4 of 5, but since this collection is growing, we'll <br/>
be back.  <br/>
On Saturdy, we went up to Mt. Hood and snaged the Little Crater Lake <br/>
box, which surprised me since I forgot the clues at home!  When we <br/>
found this box, it was almost out in the open, somewhat behind the <br/>
tree.  We re-hid it better, however I think that it won't last very <br/>
long.  I noticed that forest creatures have chewed on the lid.  I <br/>
suggest the next person who visits this box bring some bark or a rock <br/>
to cover it better.<br/>
Next we went to Umbrella Falls.  This one's hiding spot was perfect, <br/>
yet easy to find (with the clues in hand).<br/>
Sunday we blew off household chores and captured the entire Upper <br/>
MacLeay Series by Paisly Orca, Barry's MacLeay Box, plus one more!  <br/>
During the weekend adventures, the Multi-tasking HH was found, and HH <br/>
George decided to end his ride.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a great weekend with 12 finds.  I wouldn't have <br/>
gone to several of these locations without being involved in LB.<br/>

We've been on or over the mountain 4 weekends in a row.  So it may not be soon enough to check it before the snow flies any help would be wonderful. SP      <br/>

...and why then is your stamp so noticeably absent in the Central Oregon letterboxes? <br/>
Inquiring minds want to know. You have work to do! Funhog<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Somehow we have managed to leave the house without our letterboxing kits.  Even, yesterday, at the Central Oregon Pumpkin Patch,  I pointed to Smith Rocks and said, " there is a letterbox right over there, too" after having pointed out that there are boxes at the Cove,  and Trillium Lake, and Twin Lakes, and several other locations as well; explaining to our companions which ones we have found and where there are boxes that we have yet to find, as we drove past each area.   I guess we've taken a bit of hiatus,  or maybe just backing off a bit.       We also noticed that last week they covered all the campground signs and have most of the deep snow reflectors up.   Hunting season is also upon us.  Be careful out there!       <br/>
