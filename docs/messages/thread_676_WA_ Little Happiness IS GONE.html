Kelsey Creek, Bellevue WA.<br/>
<br/>
This box has been reported lost and found several times.<br/>
<br/>
Lizard and Catbird placed this box early last year and have since <br/>
moved.  I offered to adopt the box.  <br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the line, perhaps spring of 2002 a second box showed <br/>
up at the spot.  This box is the Green Crock, a crocodile stamp in <br/>
green and I believe placed by a local school teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I have searched the tree up to my elbows.  There is a cavity with a <br/>
drop off far back and to the right of the cavity that holds the box.  <br/>
It falls away to nothing and is not accessible from any other hole in <br/>
the tree.  It is possible that the smaller Little Happiness fell into <br/>
the pit never to be recovered.  Lizard and Catbird did NOT pull the <br/>
box before they moved, as I had assumed.  <br/>
<br/>
I looked at the log book of the Green Crock Box and noted a comment <br/>
by Team Rayvenhaus about "happiness being..."   <br/>
<br/>
I am assuming that the people reporting finding the Little Happiness <br/>
( the image is that of a dim sum; chopstix, take away carton and <br/>
dumplings) are really finding the green crock.<br/>
<br/>
I will leave the clues in place which allows folks to find the GC and <br/>
enjoy the hike.  Right now I cannot edit the clues sheet.  I will <br/>
tackle that next.<br/>
