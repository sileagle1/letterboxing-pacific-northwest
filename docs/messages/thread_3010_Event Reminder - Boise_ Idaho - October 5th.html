                    <html><body><p>As a reminder we have a Faery themed Letterboxing Event on Saturday, October 5th in Boise, Idaho.  We need a pretty firm count as we are preparing some special “extra” Faerie quests and need to make sure we have enough for everyone.  Last minute signup’s will really put the squeeze on our wings to prepare for so if you are sitting on the fence about attending please be sure to register soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a great opportunity to meet other local boxers, learn more about boxing and have a chance to stamp into boxes that have been created and carved from Letterboxers living out of state.  After the event the out of state boxes will be flying away.  You can sign up here if interested:</p>
