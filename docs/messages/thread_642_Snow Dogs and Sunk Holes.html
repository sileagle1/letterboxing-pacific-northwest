Stopped by a place that I would never have guessed existed, Hylebos SP.  Fantastic place, very peaceful and unique.  Found the 'W'easel, great location.  The Sink Hole was not to be found.  Ready to claim I had dropped my pen thru the crack on the platform, layed down and felt and looked under the appropriate plank, and the others that were open to looking, but nothing.  Must have fell in the Sink Hole (didn't see it floating there :-(<br>

Even so, a enjoyable time in two great parks, Thanks!<br>

Well, Fudrick, you're smarter than I am, finding all those Dogs!!  I <br>
went back to find #6-#8, and the clues just didn't match where I was <br>
walking!!  Could not find fallen logs anywhere!  But then, I'm also <br>
having trouble finding Clown #3 (Feets) in Ft. Steilacoom Park, which <br>
is also supposed to be under a log, so logs must be my bain!<br>
<br>
Anyhow, if you or a Rayvenhaus member has time, can I describe where <br>
I'm having trouble and get a few hints?  Any help would be <br>
appreciated!<br>
