<br>
Constellation Park Marine Reserve is located within Charles Richey, Sr.<br>
Viewpoint Park in West Seattle. Charles Richey, Sr. owned and operated the<br>
Seaside Pharmacy on Alki Beach many years ago. The Alki Bakery now occupies<br>
that space. When I was growing up, I'd collect Coke bottles along the beach<br>
until I had enough deposit money to buy a balsa wood glider, paper kite or<br>
comic book from Richey's Pharmacy. It had a soda fountain in front and the<br>
pharmacy counter in back. Great memories<br>
<br>
Clues:<br>
Find the sign for Charles Richey, Sr. Viewpoint near the corner of 63rd SW<br>
and Beach Drive SW. Stand with the sign between you and the beach. Head 140<br>
degrees (all readings are magnetic) until you are standing in front of a<br>
tiled mural. Here you will discover the Intertidal World. See drawings and<br>
descriptions of life living on the edge of land and water. Kelp, anemones,<br>
sea cucumbers, cockles, horse clams, moon snails and giant pacific octopus<br>
decorate the tiles. Try timing your visit at low tide so you can see the<br>
wonderful tide pools on the beach. A mature bald eagle with a fish in its<br>
talons flew over my head as I was planting this letterbox!<br>
<br>
Find the tile with the giant pacific octopus. Stand with your back to it.<br>
Head 290 degrees for 7 paces to a small path through the rocks. Walk 8<br>
paces towards 210 degrees. You will find yourself on or near the driftwood<br>
marking the high tide line. Head 330 degrees for 7 paces. Look for a<br>
flat-topped rock with a crevice underneath. The letterbox is within,<br>
covered by small pieces of driftwood. There is a small grayish rock to its<br>
left as you look >from the beach towards the street. When standing directly<br>
on top of the flat rock, you will see a Warning Sign at 70 degrees.<br>
<br>
Since this area of beach takes a beating from storms each winter, this box<br>
will only be available spring through fall. I will post here when the box<br>
is pulled for winter.<br>
<br>
Be very discreet when finding, stamping and re-hiding this letterbox. Make<br>
sure it's hidden from direct view by driftwood. Thank you.<br>
<br>
This is my third letterbox placed. Please let me know what you think of it.<br>
