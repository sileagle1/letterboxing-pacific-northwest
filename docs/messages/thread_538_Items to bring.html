Team Rayvenhaus wants to bring the Hamburgers/Hotdogs to the meeting this Saturday.  First off, would that be acceptable and if so, how many do we think we need?  We're bringing hotdogs, Hamburgers, buns for both and the condiments if needed.  Perhaps, sine a picnic type setting needs it, potato salad!<br>
<br>
Let me know soonest, we're buying the stuff tonight, if it's ok to do so.<br>

That would be fantastic!  I don't know how many will be there, the chats may <br>
give some clue.<br>
<br>
My recollection is that the picnic area by the playground doesn't have any <br>
cooking facilities, just picnic tables.  I can stop by and look, post it to the <br>
chat list when I verify what is (or isn't) there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Looking forward to a great time!!!<br>
<br>
We can also discuss how Washington Counties are regionalized, see if there is <br>
any concensious (sp???) on how South Puget Sound and SouthWest Washington <br>
should be divvied up.<br>

We will be: Cami (Momma of indeterminate), Gryphon 5, Rowan 2, and <br>
our visitor from Illinois, Leecia, 25. Also our newest member of the <br>
family, Cleo the scaredy shelter dog. She's a lab who has a past <br>
history of abuse, so she'll be a little stand-offish but is really a <br>
sweet dog. <br>
<br>
We will bring: Juice boxes for the kiddos and some salad type dish-<br>
macaroni? Pasta? Something like that. We won't be there until 11 or <br>
so, though.<br>
<br>
We also will be sporting our NEW, HAND CARVED (tonight! On erasers!) <br>
signature stamps to replace the pathetically boring storebought one <br>
we had.<br>
<br>
See you all tommorrow...<br>
