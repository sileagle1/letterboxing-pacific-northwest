                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all.<br>
<br>
A friend told me about letterboxing last week. Until then, I'd never heard<br>
of this marvelous pastime. After reading about how it works, I became quite<br>
excited about trying it out.<br>
<br>
I stopped by my local rubber stamp store to buy supplies for making stamps.<br>
And whom should I meet, but the moderator of this group, Ryan! He<br>
graciously took me under his wing and gave me some great tips for getting<br>
started. Thanks Ryan.<br>
<br>
So my wife, our Airedale Terrier Keegan and I set out to find the Mee Kwa<br>
Mooks Low Tide box and then on to Lincoln Park for Amanda's two boxes and<br>
Seattle Mud Puddle Trotter's 3 box series.<br>
<br>
As we got ready to go, I of course couldn't find my find my personal stamp<br>
I'd carved. Twenty minutes later, I had another stamp carved and out the<br>
door we went.<br>
<br>
We successfully found the Mee Kwa Mooks Low Tide box. It's in good<br>
condition and has a very nice handmade journal. It's down to its last few<br>
pages though.<br>
<br>
I mountain bike through this park as well as Lincoln Park and never even<br>
knew letterboxes were hidden within. Cool!<br>
<br>
Then it was off to Lincoln Park. Keegan got to chase lots of squirrels as<br>
we searched for the five total boxes hidden about. The first up was<br>
Amanda's box #1. We found the 4-in-1 clue. I assume the box is supposed to<br>
be in the crotch of the 4-in-1 but I couldn't find it. This one could be<br>
MIA.<br>
<br>
We found box #2, the Vashon Island Ferry, alive and well. What a beautiful<br>
place to see the ferries and the Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
Then it was on to Mud Puddle's series of three boxes. #1 Clover box was<br>
found with some difficulty, but worth the hunt. It's a two-sided stamp.<br>
Nice.<br>
<br>
#2 Stump box was a bit easier to find. It's on a trail I mountain bike<br>
every time I ride the park. Amazing. Someone had written in the #2 journal<br>
that they believed the #3 Slug box has gone missing.<br>
<br>
I easily found the general area where the Slug box is supposed to be<br>
hidden, but was unable to find it. I am not sure if it's MIA or I was just<br>
not diligent enough in my searching. Anyone bagged this one lately?<br>
<br>
So all in all not a bad day. Four out of six. I'll take it for being a newbie.<br>
<br>
See you on the trail.<br>

*hehe*  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.  I've never bumped into a <br>
letterboxer on the trail, but I have my first "stamp-store bump" <br>
now!  Of course, neither of us had signature stamps to exchange, but <br>
you can bet I'll be making a habit of carrying mine around a little <br>
more often....<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the world of letterboxing, Danny! It's great to hear the <br>
story of your first time out, especially since these exact boxes were <br>
my first ones as well, a year ago. I didn't have a stamp at the time <br>
so I'm going to have to go back and stamp into these guys - maybe as <br>
a year anniversary celebration? <br>
<br>
I love Lincoln Park. The Slug Box was alive and well a year ago and <br>
there were rumors then that it was gone. Anyone been there recently? <br>
It's a bit of a challenging one to find. I'll have to go back and <br>
look! Nice job on all of your finds and have fun!<br>
<br>
see you on the trail,<br>
