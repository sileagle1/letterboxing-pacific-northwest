<br/>
Trekkiemom, Flutterby and I made our second trip out to Leif Erikson<br/>
Drive this past Sunday to grab the remaining five boxes that we were<br/>
missing from the Musician Series.  For the few of you who may not know<br/>
too much about this series, it is a definite MUST for boxers in the<br/>
Portland area.  I think the series includes over 20 boxes, all of<br/>
which feature fabulous stamps and great clues.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Trekkiemom carved two stamps for this series after we made our<br/>
first visit last year.  Sunday, we were finally able to plant them. <br/>
Clues are located in the usual places.  I've got a box I'm working for<br/>
the series and will hopefully get up to plant it before the end of summer.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy :)<br/>
