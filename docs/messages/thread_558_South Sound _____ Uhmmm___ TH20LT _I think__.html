We had such a blast at the event, I want to thank everyone that was there for accepting us with open arms, (us newbies that is).  You guys are the ones that Rock!!!  It is now 10:44 p.m. and aver 16 miles of letterboxing in two days, I'm dead... I'm actually not even typing this, I'm so dead... (thanks RayvenMommie!)<br>
<br>
I have a SitRep coming with the team Rayvenhaus and the Wingnut & crew escapades that I will do tomorrow... didn't want anyone being disappointed without knowing why!  <br>
<br>
Next one's on us!!!<br>
<br>
Until then, goodnight!!<br>
<br>
Team Rayvenhaus<br>
