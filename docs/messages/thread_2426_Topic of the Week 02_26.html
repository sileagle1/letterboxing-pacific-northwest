Let's  hear about the first letterbox you found and why it was<br/>
memorable (if it  was).  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My first box (Old Blue was not into it until a couple of months later) was  <br/>
"The Davis Box" in Davis, CA May 10, 2002. (The original placer is  <br/>
who-knows-where and Ryan has adopted it) Since I live here and know the area the  2-page <br/>
clue took you through (The UCDavis campus) I jumped to the final couple  of <br/>
paragraphs. Yes, I cheated on my very first box!! The last 3 words of the  clue <br/>
(at that time) were, "raise the roof!" They wanted me to stand on a chair  and <br/>
push on the ceiling tile to get this box!!! Can you imagine a Newbie in a  <br/>
public place doing such a thing?? I was far too shy and waited until the next  <br/>
day when I could bring my daughter to stand guard--and take a photo of me  <br/>
finding the box!! (I pasted it in the first page of my first log book!) <br/>
<br/>
Today, the box is no longer in such a precarious place (due to an  <br/>
unfortunate 'security alert' post-9-11, when some unfortunate 'boxers got caught  and <br/>
touched off a 'lock down'!) I'll tell you, it was a long time before I found  a <br/>
box as exciting as that!!  <br/>

It was amazing to learn that there was this hidden treasure so close to home. I remember <br/>
opening that box, pulling out my storebought stamp to sign in and marvelling at the hand <br/>
carved stamp inside the box. I hoped that one day I might be able to make one of my very <br/>
own. Who knew that it would be impossible to stop at just one? Funhog<br/>

I found it several years ago and the stamp had at that point, broken  <br/>

I didn't realize you and Ryan had planted a replacement box. I'll  <br/>
have to give a look see next time we're hiking in that direction!<br/>

Wow! I didn't realize anybody had gotten that box! =) It had probably<br/>
been there for two years before I got a report by someone saying they<br/>
couldn't find it. You really quite the adventure if that was your<br/>
first box. Everything else must have been anti-climatic, huh? ;o)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">After stumbling upon virtual letterboxes while looking for something else online, I was excited about the idea of regular letterboxing, but skeptical because I figured there would be none in this area.  Lo and behold, there were TWO.  My friend, Chrysotile, and I went to find these two and one further away.  I tried explaining the concept to her, but she didn't really understand until we found our first box.<br/>
<br/>
  It was at Bradley Lake Park (where one of my earlier planted boxes is now, too) in the roots of a tree.  It has since disappeared...does anybody know what happened to Go Fish?  It seemed a pretty good spot to me, though bugs liked to gather on top of it.  I'd never been bit on the toe by an ant before!  After Bradley, we went to Wildwood Park to find the box there by Flowerlion.  Our last stop for the day was Amanda's Flaming Geyser box.  We went all the way up the hill and came back down without finding it!  It turns out the flaming geyser wasn't actually flaming that day, and we mistook it for a random pit that had been used as a trash dump.  Disappointing as that was, we did find the box and actually left the park before sundown.<br/>
<br/>
  Chrysotile called her mom as we were leaving to let her know she'd made it out alive (you know how mothers are...) and her mother asked, "Did you find that....thing you were looking for?"  haha.<br/>
<br/>
  We actually had our own hand-carved stamps for that trip, and I used mine for quite a while before it desintegrated.  It's hard to believe that was nearly two years ago now.<br/>
<br/>
  But seriously, if anybody knows what happened to Go Fish, please let me know.  I kind of wanted to plant a box in the same place, but not as much if it got stolen or vandalized or something...<br/>
