<br>
We had a wonderful time at the Silver Falls Gathering, I'm sorry no one<br>
else got any sleep because I was snoring so loudly that everyone else<br>
was kept awake.  Geez...I never shut up.  Not even in slumber.  What can<br>
one do about that darned whale!  <br>
<br>
It was excellent to see all the familiar letterboxers that I know and<br>
love and some cool new ones such as Wild Hare & family!  I had made Wild<br>
Hare's acquaintance once upon a time when we were both younger whipper<br>
snappers in the early 80's.  Nice to finally meet Maiden and her fine<br>
family.  I'm with Brett on the Downhill Sk8ter comment.  What a great<br>
kid.  <br>
<br>
That is what I love most about gatherings.  Not so much the<br>
letterboxing, per se, but the chance to see everyone and watch the kids<br>
all grow up so nicely!  It's so great seeing Button, Shark and Lil Bug<br>
growing like weeds and having fun chasing around and being delightful.<br>
I just love "Mily, Wingnut & Tony's little girl! Grace & Nicholas make<br>
me smile everytime I see them! Team Garlic's sons are just awesome, as<br>
usual.  And I can never say enough about my good friend, Carie's, little<br>
boy, Kyle.  He's just so polite and such a great kid.  Jay was cool!<br>
Every child I came across that was part of our letterboxing deal were<br>
wonderful!!!   SO MUCH FUN!!!<br>
<br>
As for Forest People, we were wondering where you were!  Your images<br>
were oohed and ahhed over in various logbooks and your names were<br>
mentioned and highly-praised more than once this weekend!   Someday,<br>
maybe.  When will we get to see you guys again?  I'd love to see Nate<br>
and Becca again, as they are terrific children and excellent carvers!<br>
Not to mention wife with the marimba!  (Was that what that was at Milo?)<br>
Good for you for nabbing the Hidden Dragon!  I've never even tried for<br>
that OR Warrior Rock.<br>
<br>
My brain is getting better with age, as far as clues go, I've noticed.<br>
There have been a couple mystery boxes I've figured out all by myself<br>
without help!  Unbelieveable.  Maybe, like fine wine, I'm getting better<br>
with age (nice try, but not likely, eh?)  One thing is for sure...Some<br>
of us are shrinking with age!  Double Tall, The Lone Lennen and I are<br>
becoming less ourselves than we once were in a good way!  Keep up the<br>
great work, Ladies!!!<br>
<br>
John and I had an excellent time.  Thanks to Brett and Penny for putting<br>
together a terrific gathering that we could all enjoy.   Seemed that for<br>
the most part it was an excellent time!   Where were Mark & Beth???  Is<br>
it possible that they could be the elusive Miller & Hutch?  We missed<br>
them at this gathering, as well!  Or did we???   Thanks to everyone for<br>
coming and for everything that everyone contributed.  We sure know how<br>
to have fun in beautiful places.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
