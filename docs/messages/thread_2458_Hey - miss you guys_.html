around and interested in Lbing.<br>
We miss you all - have been deep in to health issues through the winter and<br>
other time consuming stuff is happening.  BUT thanks for all your posts -<br>
they are bright spots in an otherwise dull period of time.    It's not like<br>
we'll make it to the Spring Flinger but we hope to make it to a gathering or<br>
two this summer.  Hard to believe we still haven't met Calli-K!!<br>
<br>
On the brighter side, Wood-aug and I did get out and place a few boxes in<br>
Day Break park a few weeks back.<br>
<br>
Thunderbird - we just HAVE to get together when you're in the Portland area!<br>

Taa-taa and hope to see you fun folks on the trail!<br>
