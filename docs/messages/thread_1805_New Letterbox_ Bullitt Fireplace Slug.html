Ryan and I decided to get outside on this dreary, rainy day. We hiked<br>
up to the Bullitt Fireplace on Squak Mountain and I left a letterbox<br>
up there.  It is about 5 miles round-trip. But the elevation gain is<br>
only 900 ft or so and it is a very nice gradual climb up. (took us<br>
about 2 1/2 hours for the whole trip) The Central Peak trail is<br>
supposed to have views of Seattle (on a clear day). Practically no<br>
parking at the trailhead, which explains why these trails don't get as<br>
much use as the ones next door at Cougar Mountain. Ryan and I saw 2<br>
other hikers on this day. On a sunny weekend, I can see that it might<br>
be much busier!<br>
<br>
The Bullitt Fireplace Slug letterbox clue is available at Atlas Quest.<br>
