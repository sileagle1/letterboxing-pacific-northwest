<br/>
I have been out of the lb'g loop for a short while and now am ready to <br/>
return with a new letterboxing companion.<br/>
<br/>
My home just got blessed with a boxer puppy.  Her name is Kayo (KO) because <br/>
she's my little knockout.  She doesn't know it yet, but she's my new <br/>
letterboxing companion.  I'm hoping to train her to snoop out those elusive <br/>
boxes for me *grinz*<br/>
<br/>
I'm even thinking of making her her own log in stamp... and maybe a box to <br/>
commemorate her first hunt... *smiles*<br/>
<br/>
Aysia, my shepard, who previously accompanied me on my letterboxing <br/>
adventures passed away about 6 weeks ago.  I wasn't in the mood to go boxing <br/>
without her but now that I have a new partner in crime I'm thinking it's <br/>
time to break her in... of course she's still only 6 pounds and has <br/>
definately not figured out what her leash is for... but that will come...<br/>
<br/>
Hope we see you on the trail,<br/>
<br/>
Jessi<br/>
<br/>
