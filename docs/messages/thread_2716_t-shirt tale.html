                    <div class="plaintext-content">This was too funny... I had a rendezvous planned this morning with a<br/>
California letterboxer who has family here in Portland. We planned to<br/>
meet at a coffee shop near my home. I had never met this person before<br/>
but I figured it wouldn't be too hard to pick her out. I arrived right<br/>
on time, perused the people sitting at tables and spotted a likely<br/>
suspect. I walked over to her table and spotted her canvas tote bag.<br/>
Emblazoned on it was the slogan, "Not all who wander are lost."<br/>
Eureka! I'd found my letterboxing compatriot.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I repeated the phrase to her expecting immediate recognition.<br/>
When she gave me a blank stare, I asked if she was the boxer I was<br/>
meeting. Another blank look clued me in that this wasn't a letterboxer<br/>
at all, just another fan of The Lord of the Rings. She cracked up when<br/>
I pulled off my jacket, turned around and showed her my slug<br/>
ornamented t-shirt with the matching words.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, I spotted the correct person with a pack on her back. I<br/>
was no longer wandering around looking lost. Funhog<br/>
