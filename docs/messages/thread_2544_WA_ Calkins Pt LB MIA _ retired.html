anyway.  I stopped by the earlier reported 'could not find' Calkins Pt <br/>
LB on Mercer Island and indeed it was not there and presumably has <br/>
ended up in some kid's treasure trove of junk.  I just repaired this <br/>
box in March and now it's wandered off.  I'll retire it now but the <br/>
clues will remain up there in the event it decides to 'reappear' in the <br/>
future.  It's still a beautiful place to explore and definitely a spot <br/>
worth visiting even without a LB or two to hunt out.  There should <br/>
still be 2 other LBs somewhere around there if you get the desire to <br/>
visit.  Back to my non-LBing life again...<br/>
