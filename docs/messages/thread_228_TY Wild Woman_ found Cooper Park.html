                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well it seems this lovely little box has a gardian angel.  A person <br/>
living just on the other side of the fence has adopted it and <br/>
replaced it on a weekly basis for over a year now.  It seems that <br/>
local children make a habit of over turning stumps and rummaging thru <br/>
the woods there and he sees them and runs them off, then hunts down <br/>
the box and replaces it.  He didn't even know what letterboxing was!<br/>
<br/>
This was my third time looking thanks to Wild Woman.  She emailed me <br/>
and said sometimes ya just gotta keep going back, it makes the find <br/>
sweeter! That she had found it just before me.  Well, she was right, <br/>
it really wasn't there the other 2 times I went, probably relocated <br/>
in or around the area by hoodlums. (because it was in the tall grass <br/>
this time where the girls new it was, and the Man showed us where he <br/>
found it under the log like the clues say, and I had looked there <br/>
before) Thanks to Mr Angel's sweet little daughter and her friend.  <br/>
Carie and I found it this evening and stamped in and replaced it.  We <br/>
explained letterboxing to our Angel and went along our way. BUT..... <br/>
there is a better ending.  after 3 tries, and finally finding it, we <br/>
got a bonus of the Mickey Hitch Hiker all the way from FLA!  Way <br/>
cool!  So I will be replacing that somewhere soon!  <br/>
<br/>
I am so glad to see that not everyone who runs into boxes by accident <br/>
take them, that some folks even go the extra mile to take special <br/>
care of them!  Kudos to this box's Angel, and his lovely girl and her <br/>
friend.  I am so glad I decided to go back and take yet another look!<br/>
