Don't forget that I'm lurking.<br>
 <br>
It's not hard to reorganize counties into new regions.<br>
I'll send the Excel sheet to whoever wants it.  All you need to do is fill in<br>
the region for each county, I put it in the database, and everything re-assigns<br>
itself.<br>
 <br>
That's the fun thing with databases! <br>

What if we do it by counties?  Why do we need to lump them all together in groups?<br>

  I mean, Olympia boxes are lumped in with boxes in the Columbia Gorge.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree that the deparment of tourism designations would be a great<br>
idea BUT... the database works with counties and a couple of them<br>
(Lane and Douglas) really screw up the Coast/Willamette Valley<br>
seperation. I think Hood River County should be combined with the<br>
Portland area since the rest of Mount Hood and the Gorge are listed<br>
there already. <br>
<br>
The rest of the map could stay the same. The small number of boxes in<br>
Central and Eastern Oregon could warrant the combination of the North<br>
and South designations in those two areas. However, that might be a<br>
problem when future hordes of letterboxes are hidden in Lake and<br>
Harney Counties. I wish1<br>

Learning the location of all the counties in this fine state is yet<br>
another benefit of our fine hobby. Who knew? Funhog<br>
