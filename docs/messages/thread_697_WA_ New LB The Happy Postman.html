friends in the forest of Lewisville Park's Nature trail in Battle <br>
Ground, WA. Clues can be found on the National LB site at <br>
www.letterboxing.org. Also, while you are there, check out <br>
Soggy2pair's Lewisville Scramble LB. It is very lonely. In fact, <br>
Cat's Meow and I were firsties in this logbook that had been sitting <br>
there since last June. One word of warning though, The Stinging <br>
Nettles are out in force on the trails so please do not wander off <br>
the trail. Cat's Meow found out first hand how painful it can be but <br>
thanks to grandma Purple Iris's wonder salve Wise Women, she was back <br>
to her old frisky self and hiding boxes. Happy Hunting!<br>
