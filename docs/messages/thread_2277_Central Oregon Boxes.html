On another note I have had several boxes go missing and or need repair and <br>
decided to retire them to leave some room for some new letterboxers in our <br>
area to place and possibly get some more variety.  I eventually want to retire <br>
all but 5 to 10 of them.  Currently we have about 25. (Quality not quantity I <br>
keep telling myself). I will start having boxes with a limited time frame to make <br>
them more special also. <br>
<br>
That's all for now,<br>

P.S.<br>
I think we will have some new boxers in the area, we introduced some friends <br>
to it ...and they love it! <br>
