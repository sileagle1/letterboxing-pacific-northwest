Chapter 2<br/>
<br/>
The Wharfman Pub, Jack's place, is located in a very seedy part of the<br/>
roughest neighborhood down near the docks at the south end of the<br/>
waterfront.  It's not a good place for an evening walk if you don't<br/>
have a bulldog with you or a shotgun for personal protection.  I only<br/>
carry a handgun so I decided to take a cab.  The driver dropped me at<br/>
the corner of 4th and Davis and I paid 20 for a 12 dollar fare.  The<br/>
driver argued with me about taking the coin until he bit it and his<br/>
gold tooth stuck.  Then he drove off smiling spinning his rear tires<br/>
and throwing a spray of filthy rain and street filth on my pants. <br/>
I'll have to remember to go by Lu Tan's cleaners tomorrow and pick up<br/>
my laundry now that I can pay the old guy back the money I owe from<br/>
last month's cleaning.  I'd been making due for 3 weeks on 2 pairs of<br/>
worn out trousers and 3 white shirts that were beginning to yellow<br/>
pretty bad.  This lonely lady with the bag of gold coins was already<br/>
paying off pretty well already.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn't have a clue where to start looking for her man but since she<br/>
already paid me a bigger retainer than any single case I had in three<br/>
years I figured I could milk that strange dame for at least a couple<br/>
of weeks and get caught up on my debts.  I hadn't even looked in the<br/>
envelope yet that she gave me but I figured that if she had been to<br/>
Jack's place that was as good a start as any for me.  Besides, I<br/>
wanted to wet my gullet on some good bourbon before turning in for the<br/>
night and get a fresh start in the morning.  <br/>
<br/>
I dropped down the steps below street level to the Wharfman Pub and<br/>
was met at the door by a 350 lb 6ft 8 wall of human flesh.  "Hello,<br/>
Mike.  How's knocks these days?"  Mike was the bouncer that helped me<br/>
muscle those two thugs who robbed Jack a couple years back. I put out<br/>
my hand to shake his.<br/>
<br/>
"Not bad, Mr. S," he said as he crushed my hand like a cracker in a<br/>
vice.  "Jack takes pretty good care of me and I still get to have some<br/>
fun every now and then when the sailors get a little too much liquor<br/>
in them."<br/>
<br/>
"Jack working the bar tonight? I need to ask him some questions about<br/>
a case I'm working on"<br/>
<br/>
"Nope.  Jimmy is on the bar tonight. I don't like that weasel.  I'm<br/>
supposed to get half of the tips these saps leave round here and I<br/>
think that Jimmy is not giving me my full share. Jack's not been in a<br/>
good mood lately. He hasn't been working the bar for a couple of days.<br/>
He should be in his office though.  Hey, SB, you might have some work<br/>
for me on this case of yours? Things are a little slow around here if<br/>
you know what I mean." <br/>
<br/>
"I'll let you know, Mike.  Never know when a guy could use a hand in<br/>
this business."<br/>
<br/>
"Thanks. Go on in, I'll let Jack know you're here."  Mike reached<br/>
around the side of the door post and pressed a hidden button twice<br/>
that lit a red light under the bar and in the office of the pub.  That<br/>
was the signal of a friend entering.  It was a holdover from<br/>
prohibition days but was still useful for getting a message thru to<br/>
the barkeep without words.  <br/>
<br/>
The Wharfman was originally built somewhere around 1842.  Over the<br/>
years it had burned down twice and once been leveled in an earthquake<br/>
only to be resurrected again.  Its current reincarnation was as a dark<br/>
little dive thick with cigar smoke and the smell of watered down<br/>
whiskey and spilled beer.  The cedar plank floor was always filthy and<br/>
the tables and chairs pocked with cigarette burns.  The walls were<br/>
plastered with nicotine stained pin up girls, beer signs, and<br/>
lithograph paintings of cargo ships that called this town home port. <br/>
There was a single fan spinning slowly above the bar that moved the<br/>
smoke and smell around in little wisps but never really improved the<br/>
air quality.  <br/>
<br/>
The place was a little slow for a Friday night. Six patrons total: one<br/>
derelict passed out at the corner table next to the head, two old sea<br/>
dogs at the bar drinking whiskey and beer chasers, one skinny guy with<br/>
a big scar across his cheek at the other corner table drinking beer<br/>
from a bottle, and two burly longshoremen at another table in the<br/>
center of the room.  These last two were sharing a bottle of rum and<br/>
from the looks of it they were about 2 pours short of finishing it. <br/>
Behind the bar was Jimmy, Jack's brother in law.  He was ugly,<br/>
scrawny, perpetually smelled of B.O. and had the look of someone who<br/>
would cut your throat if you turned your back to him for more than a<br/>
second.  I never trusted Jimmy and I suspected that he was somehow<br/>
connected to the robbery but Jack wouldn't hear it.  I'm sure that had<br/>
to do with Jack's wife though.  Jack knew he was dirty. Even told me<br/>
he caught Jimmy filching from the till a few times but figured that as<br/>
long as he kept Jimmy gainfully employed he wouldn't have to hear his<br/>
wife nag him about it so he just looked the other way for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
I caught a glimpse of Jack thru the barred window on his office door.<br/>
He nodded at me but I walked up to the end of the bar and sat down.  I<br/>
wiped away some spilled beer with my coat sleeve and Jimmy came over.<br/>
 "Well, Mr. big time detective.  Haven't seen you in here for quite a<br/>
while.  What's the matter, the private dick game so bad you gotta come<br/>
round here lookin for some more sailors to roust?"<br/>
<br/>
"You know as well as I do, Jimmy, that those two slimeballs were the<br/>
ones who knocked over Jack's place.  I only got back what rightfully<br/>
belonged to Jack."<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, and took a 20% cut for yourself."  He leaned in close so I<br/>
could smell his rotting teeth, "You know that cut should have been<br/>
mine, would have been mine too if you hadn't put your nose in where it<br/>
didn't belong."<br/>
<br/>
"That's right, Jimmy. I got my cut for recovering the stolen money and<br/>
you got to keep your place here at Jack's bar.  You want me to let<br/>
Jack know the truth about you and those two sailors?  Seems a like<br/>
slow night, I'm sure Jack can handle the bar himself and I bet Mike<br/>
wouldn't mind having a sparring partner keep him on his toes."<br/>
<br/>
He backed away and stood up with his hands on his hips, "What you<br/>
want, Stealthboxxer?"<br/>
<br/>
"Bourbon, straight.  And make it the good stuff that Jack keeps under<br/>
the bar, not that watered down slog you serve the losers around here.<br/>
 In fact, give me the bottle and a paper bag, I'm gonna talk to Jack<br/>
and then I'm gonna get out of this scum joint before my own teeth<br/>
start turning yellow."  I flipped a $20 coin in the air and it clanked<br/>
down on the bar.  Jimmy scooped it up and reached under the bar and<br/>
put the bottle on the table along with a shot glass.  <br/>
<br/>
I poured a shot and slammed it quick.  Jimmy opened a cupboard and<br/>
pulled out a paper sack from a market a few blocks away and set it<br/>
next to the bottle.  I poured another shot, drank it quick and put the<br/>
cap back on the bottle.  "Jack's in the office."  He nodded.  "I'll<br/>
let myself in."  I picked up the bottle and the bag and walked toward<br/>
the office door.  "Oh, by the way Jimmy, you can keep the change from<br/>
the twenty and buy yourself a toothbrush but don't forget Mike's share<br/>
or he might be inclined to beat it out of you."  He snarled as I<br/>
walked to the end of the bar and down the narrow hallway to the small<br/>
office.  <br/>
<br/>
I knocked twice quick on the door and Jack opened it.  He was on the<br/>
telephone and I could tell he was getting chewed out by his boss.  He<br/>
motioned to the chair next to the desk.  I sat down while he took the<br/>
chewing.  He slipped in a few yes, sirs every now and then and finally<br/>
said, "Ok sir, I will get right on that first thing.  I'll have the<br/>
books ready for your assistant on Monday morning.  No, of course, I<br/>
meant Sunday morning. Yes, sir.Yes, sir.  Alright, you can count on<br/>
me, sir.  Thank you sir."  <br/>
<br/>
He hung up the phone and slumped back in his chair.  He wiped the<br/>
beads of sweat off of his brow and reached into the desk drawer and<br/>
pulled out a bottle of gin and poured himself half a stained coffee<br/>
cup full and drank most of it before turning to me coughing.  "Well,<br/>
SB. I figured I'd be getting a visit from you soon.  The way I seen it<br/>
either that broad was headed for the funny farm or she would end up<br/>
hiring you for sure.  I hope you got paid up front."<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, she took care of me alright. Thanks for the referral, Jack.<br/>
Now, tell me, what the heck was she doing here in the first place?<br/>
She's certainly not your regular clientele. "<br/>
<br/>
"Strange broad showed up here at about noon yesterday.  She kept<br/>
banging on the front door and demanding to speak to the `proprietor'.<br/>
 I've been sleeping here most nights since Margaret and me had a fight<br/>
last week so I was sacked out in the back room on that cot that I used<br/>
to let Mike sleep on.  She woke me up, and during broad daylight too."<br/>
 He finished the drink and poured another.  He offered the bottle to<br/>
me and I showed him the bourbon I had bought.  "Hey, that's the good<br/>
stuff.  That dame really must have taken care of you for you to be<br/>
dropping fifteen smackers on a bottle of whiskey. Only time I ever<br/>
seen you buy a bottle is when you just got lucky."<br/>
<br/>
"Like I said, thanks for the referral. Tell me more"<br/>
<br/>
"Anyway, she kept making a big fuss outside and she sounded like she<br/>
was crying so I eventually let her in.  She spoke like some kind of<br/>
duchess or royalty of something all proper and such.  Weird.  She said<br/>
that she was looking for her boyfriend or husband or some guy, I never<br/>
caught his name.  She said that this guy had mentioned my bar in a<br/>
letter that he had left for her and that she, how did she say it,<br/>
"must be reunited to him or I shalln't endure another fortnight". She<br/>
actually said that. I had no idea what the heck she was talking about<br/>
and I didn't really want to continue the conversation so I gave her<br/>
your name.  Hey, SB, I hope I didn't cause you some kind of trouble by<br/>
sending this whack job your way.  I know things haven't been great for<br/>
you lately so I figured that if this dame was really that desperate to<br/>
find this guy, she probably wouldn't mind parting with a little dough<br/>
to get him.  I was just trying to throw you a bone seeing how you<br/>
helped me out a while back.  By the way, if you hadn't found those<br/>
creeps and got that money back I would probably be wearing concrete<br/>
galoshes by now. You know how Mr. Patello is about his money."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, Jack I have heard about how Mr. Patello takes care of his<br/>
possessions.  I'm just glad for my own sake as well as yours that I<br/>
found those thugs.  If Patello and his men had found out that you<br/>
hired me and I didn't turn up with the money I'm sure they would have<br/>
assumed that I did and just didn't come to them with it.  You and I<br/>
both would be talking to the fishies by now.  So, you never seen this<br/>
broad before yesterday?  You have no idea of who she was looking for?"<br/>
<br/>
"Nope. I have no idea what she was talking about.  She did mention a<br/>
ship called the, uh, Escalate I think she said or something like that.<br/>
 Portuguese or Spanish sounding name I thought.  Said that this guy<br/>
she was looking for was supposed to meet the captain of this ship in<br/>
my bar two months ago.  I have never heard of the Escalate and have no<br/>
idea of who she was talking about.  But, there are a lot of sailors<br/>
that come thru this port and most who come in here don't usually want<br/>
to talk about who they are or the name of the ship they are from. <br/>
Guys that want to brag about their merry sea life do that at those<br/>
swanky joints up on the north end of the wharf.  My place is dark and<br/>
quiet and my customers like it that way.  And so do I. I don't want to<br/>
know anything as long as they pay for their whiskey and don't break my<br/>
glasses."<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, I figured that Jack.  EscalateI think I'm gonna have to pay a<br/>
visit to the harbormasters office and find out about that ship."<br/>
<br/>
"You plan on going there now?"<br/>
<br/>
"Nope, I'll do it first thing in the morning.  Ms Mystery lady is<br/>
going to have to wait for old Stealthboxxer to do his work on his time<br/>
schedule.  I've got a bottle of good bourbon, a pocket full of change,<br/>
and a hankering for some fried chicken from Stella's place.  I'll work<br/>
on the mystery ship and her captain tomorrow.  Thanks for the tip<br/>
Jack, I needed a good case to bring in a little dough.  I appreciate<br/>
it."  I got up and headed for his door.  "By the way, when you gonna<br/>
get rid of Jimmy? That dirt bag is a no good leech and you know it."<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, dang it, SB.  That's what Margaret and me were fightin about last<br/>
week. She threw me out for even mentioning that the little weasel<br/>
might have been involved with that robbery a while back.  I know he's<br/>
skimming the till but he knows that I've been holding back part of<br/>
Patello's take to cover some sideline deals and he has me over a<br/>
barrel right now.  I have to put up with Jimmy or lose a leg. I think<br/>
that Patello knows about my side deals and I have to be real careful<br/>
right now.  One of these days I'm gonna pay off Patello for good and<br/>
get rid of that stinking low life Jimmy and I don't care what my wife<br/>
says about it.  He's her brother, she can take him if she wants him."<br/>
<br/>
"Well, good.  I'm glad you have a plan at least.  I just hope that<br/>
your plan doesn't end up costing you your life and not just your<br/>
marriage. Thanks again for the referral, Jack.  I'll let you know what<br/>
I find out about this broad's missing man."  <br/>
<br/>
I shut the door to the office and walked back down the hall to the bar<br/>
room.  Jimmy was wiping the sludge out of a tray of shot glasses with<br/>
a dirty towel.  He just glared at me as I walked by the bar toward the<br/>
door.  The drunk had fallen over and was now lying across two chairs<br/>
at the far table and the two longshoremen had left already, their<br/>
empty rum bottle and dirty glasses and ashtray was still on the table.<br/>
 I said goodnight to Mike and told him that Jimmy had some money for<br/>
him on the way out the door and he slapped me on the back and I almost<br/>
lost my breath.  I headed back up the steps to the street level just<br/>
in time to flag a cab and headed toward home.<br/>
<br/>
The harbormasters office was always open due to ships coming and going<br/>
at all hours of the day and night.  The head pilot for the<br/>
harbormasters office didn't work weekends which was fine with me.  I<br/>
had run into some trouble with him a few years back on a case<br/>
involving a gun runner from Panama so I figured that it would be best<br/>
to call on the office on the weekend anyway.  I planned to show up<br/>
around 10 am and work the junior pilot over for some information about<br/>
a ship called Escalate.  Then I would have enough time to make contact<br/>
with my friend from the FBI.  If the bureau had any info on this ship<br/>
or on the missing man my friend might be able to help me out.  <br/>
<br/>
That was my plan anyway.  After a dinner of Stella's chicken and corn<br/>
biscuits I headed back to my place to have a few stiff drinks of<br/>
bourbon.  I was taking off my coat when I remembered the envelope.  I<br/>
opened the envelope that the lady had given me and found this strange<br/>
message:<br/>
<br/>
Dearest -----------<br/>
It is with a heavy heart that I must leave you this letter.  Haste<br/>
causes me to rely upon pen and paper to convey my sentiments of sorrow<br/>
at my leaving you for a time of unknown length. Had I more time I<br/>
would deliver this message to you, my dear, from mine own lips<br/>
directly to your delicate ears. But time is a preciously scarce<br/>
commodity for me now. I regret to tell you that I am now embarked on a<br/>
mission of great import, of such import that I cannot even dare to<br/>
write for fear of discovery.  Failing in this endeavor would be<br/>
catastrophic, so much is at stake.  I know not if I shall even return<br/>
but if all goes well I shall return to you in two months hence.  In<br/>
the event that I do not return by All Saints Day, inquire of me in the<br/>
town of Olympia on Puget's Sound at the public house nearest the<br/>
waterfront.  All I can say is that I am to meet the captain of the<br/>
cargo ship, Escalate, in one week. I cannot tell you why I must meet<br/>
this man only that all of our future depends on what will transpire<br/>
there. I will miss you dearest, pray for my success and soon return.<br/>
<br/>
Yours forever,<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Not much to go on. Not even a name. This woman was not making it easy<br/>
on me. But seeing how she paid so well I figured I could afford to<br/>
play along. I had another drink and then passed out on the couch.  I<br/>
didn't wake up until 1pm the next day.<br/>
<br/>
