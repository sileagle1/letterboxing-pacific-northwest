all that snow at Denny Creek last week.  Discovery Park actually had <br>
a blizzard today!  Great series!  Found all 6 despite a slight <br>
glitch of not having clues for #2-6.  Long printer/internet mishap <br>
story but we managed to gently probe well enough (with a letterbox <br>
placer's eye) for the other 5 in the series!  Cute stamps, too!  <br>
Thanks Candlelight for a job well done!<br>
<br>
Saw a couple Bald Eagles and some sort of an Egret today (just a few <br>
feet away from us) near Lake Washington--is there such a thing as a <br>
crowned egret with multiple colors?  This one was really big with a <br>
large yellow/almost orange patch on its side.  I'll have to pull out <br>
my Peterson's guide...  Fortunately, I had my camera out & focused <br>
quickly enough to get a very close up shot of both the Bald Eagle <br>
(stationary & full span in flight) and the Egret!  Wow!  What a <br>
day...<br>
<br>
See you on the trails...<br>
