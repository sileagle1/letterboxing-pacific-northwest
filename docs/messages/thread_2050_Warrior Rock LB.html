was wonderful. I have lived here 9 years and never took time to sit by <br/>
the mighty Columbia. The sun broke out just as we sat down for lunch <br/>
next to the lighthouse and we enjoyed the many Blue Herons and ospray <br/>
flying overhead. Even saw several little garden snakes on the trail. <br/>
(They must have been enjoying the sun too). The grass through the <br/>
fields were shoulder high and we really felt like we were exploring <br/>
the island for the first time. Thanks DMS! Another great adventure <br/>
brought to me because of Letterboxing. <br/>
