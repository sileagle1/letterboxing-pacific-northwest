                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is very very sad news indeed.  Sleight is one of the letterboxes that<br/>
left a long standing impression on both Iron`Bear and myself.  First the<br/>
carving inside from Legerdemaine, was nothing but beautiful. Secondly, the<br/>
hiding spot was ingenious.  Iron`Bear and I had to look for this box 7 times<br/>
before finding it.  Somehow it eluded us each time we were there looking for<br/>
it, it finally took us meeting up with Funhog, and having her stand there<br/>
for the brick to suddenly fall on my head and make me look in the correct<br/>
location.  I was so proud to recover this box.  Because the stamp was so<br/>
special and the hiding place so clever, many times my friends asked for help<br/>
finding it and all I would say was what Funhog told me. You are in the right<br/>
place, keep looking it's there.  Finally after Camp Fire Lady looked for it<br/>
several times, we stopped there last week to see if she could find it with a<br/>
little help.  Alas, the box was gone. :( We were so sad to find it missing.<br/>
I am sorry to hear that this box will not be replaced, but thank you to both<br/>
Funhog and Legerdemaine for the ever lasting impression, inspiration and<br/>
memory this box left with us!<br/>

mouse at a cat farm. I don't know why it did - but I sure was irritated with<br/>
myself when we finally found it. I was practically standing on it the other<br/>
times we had searched for it - but it taught us both a valuable lesson. Not<br/>
only in searching for boxes but also in hiding our own. This is my personal<br/>
opinion - but that box was not something you just stumble upon out on the<br/>
trail. Someone flat out took the contents of that box and with purpose-<br/>

get a conscience do the noble thing and return the contents of the box. <br/>

I bid you all well. <br/>
