<br>
Went out on a LB roundabout the past few days and this is what <br>
happened...<br>
<br>
Got sticky from the honey pot near the new play area & returned to <br>
Africa and went on a wonderful safari in Bastyr (donning our tea-<br>
hats, nonetheless).  All but one were alive & well.  We next went <br>
delving into a Cougar-ridden coal mine and got pretty sooty, then <br>
beneath myriad aviatronics we were off to get stood up by someone <br>
with no flowers which thankfully brought an unexpected reward--we <br>
met Elda, too!  Then, we found our way into a federal area and <br>
burrowed beneath the sinks & found a weasel, too!  Both were alive, <br>
well & expecting...<br>

#3 I think--although I don't think the clues said what type of <br>
animal it was--we found these alive & well:  hippo, elephant, parent <br>
& child, ostrich, zebra, rare rhino & babboon...<br>

Yes, we found all of the others.  If you replaced #3 already and the <br>
clues differed from what was recently posted, it might very well <br>
still be there (the clues I had said it was going to be replaced in <br>
the future so we didn't check THAT thoroughly like we normally would <br>
if the box hadn't already been listed as missing).  I did notice <br>
that the holes around the tree were quite unstable and if you mis-<br>
stepped you'd sink about 2 feet into the ground--the dirt there is <br>
rather hollow. It's quite possible that the box has fallen into a <br>
void by the tree?  The King of the Jungle was there--all of the <br>
other boxes were alive & well and exactly where the clues dictated!<br>
