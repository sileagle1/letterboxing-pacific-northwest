<br/>
<br/>
Went out on a LB roundabout the past few days and this is what <br/>
happened...<br/>
<br/>
Got sticky from the honey pot near the new play area &amp; returned to <br/>
Africa and went on a wonderful safari in Bastyr (donning our tea-<br/>
hats, nonetheless).  All but one were alive &amp; well.  We next went <br/>
delving into a Cougar-ridden coal mine and got pretty sooty, then <br/>
beneath myriad aviatronics we were off to get stood up by someone <br/>
with no flowers which thankfully brought an unexpected reward--we <br/>
met Elda, too!  Then, we found our way into a federal area and <br/>
burrowed beneath the sinks &amp; found a weasel, too!  Both were alive, <br/>
well &amp; expecting...<br/>

#3 I think--although I don't think the clues said what type of <br/>
animal it was--we found these alive &amp; well:  hippo, elephant, parent <br/>
&amp; child, ostrich, zebra, rare rhino &amp; babboon...<br/>

Yes, we found all of the others.  If you replaced #3 already and the <br/>
clues differed from what was recently posted, it might very well <br/>
still be there (the clues I had said it was going to be replaced in <br/>
the future so we didn't check THAT thoroughly like we normally would <br/>
if the box hadn't already been listed as missing).  I did notice <br/>
that the holes around the tree were quite unstable and if you mis-<br/>
stepped you'd sink about 2 feet into the ground--the dirt there is <br/>
rather hollow. It's quite possible that the box has fallen into a <br/>
void by the tree?  The King of the Jungle was there--all of the <br/>
other boxes were alive &amp; well and exactly where the clues dictated!<br/>
