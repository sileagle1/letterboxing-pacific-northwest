                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Department of Redundancy Dept. LB is back by popular demand!  It seems <br/>
appropriate that this LB in particular had to be replaced, does it not?  Anyway, <br/>
it is now in a new, improved location, and I thank all who suggested I <br/>
replace it.  Believe me, I would not have tackled all those letters again w/o your <br/>
urging.  (If you've already gotten the first stamp, it's not really worth your <br/>
while to go back for this one.  Having run out of creativity, I simply carved <br/>
a copy.)  I'll hope it doesn't go missing again, and also wish that it stays <br/>
in place.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the "Mouth" box of the "Making Faces" series has been replaced.  Many <br/>
thanks to Heather who sat and carved the replacement mouth stamps right there <br/>
near the trident tree, while I sought a better hiding place and ran around <br/>
keeping track of various wandering children.  Happily, we'd received "Protection" <br/>
before going after the box (making us 3 for 3 on Sleepywhippet's new boxes).<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing to all!<br/>
