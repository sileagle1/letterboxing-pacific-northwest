<br>
On our way to the Spring Flinger I lost my signature stamp.  On the<br>
north Oregon coast I stamped into a box in the parking/ visitor's<br>
center. Then we went on a beautiful less than a mile hike to another<br>
box. When I sat down on the moss to stamp into the second box my<br>
signature stamp was nowhere to be found.<br>
<br>
"What have you lost while letterboxing?"<br>
<br>
We walked the trail back and forth 3 times looking - asked the staff<br>
at the visitors center and phoned to the main office leaving a message<br>
of how to contact me if it was turned in to any lost & found.  Never<br>
saw it again.<br>
<br>
"This could be a fun question."<br>
<br>
Now the Rest of the Story"  I am on my way to my very first gathering<br>
and have I no signature stamp.  We stopped in Astoria, OR (the largest<br>
city on our route)to look for carving medium and tools. Was sent 4<br>
places before a lady in a cute little paper shop offered to sell me<br>
some from her private craft box.  That nite I sat in our motel room at<br>
the little round table under the 40 watt light trying to reproduce my<br>
signature stamp.  The results were far from satisfactory but at least<br>
I had something to use for exchanges and boxes and a funny memory.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, this one was a doozey. When Doubltree showed up on the local<br>
scene and started hiding boxes on loooong hikes last summer, I was<br>
beside myself with excitement. I rounded up Der Mad Stamper and we<br>
headed out the find this "newbie's" remote offerings at Ruckel Creek.<br>
The clue assured us that we would have a hard two and a half mile hike<br>
to the farthest box, but no more. After covering about four miles and<br>
having never found the landmarks noted in the clue DMS and I cried<br>
"Uncle!" turned our sweat-drenched, svelte little bodies around to<br>
trudged back down the dreadful grade. <br>
<br>
Starting downhill, I realized that I needed to trim my big toenails or<br>
risk the dreaded black-falling-off toenail syndrome. Being the<br>
well-prepared hiker that I am, I always carry nail clippers in my<br>
backpack. I unloaded my pack in the middle of the trail and found no<br>
clippers. Having changed packs that very morning, they were resting<br>
peacefully in the old pack at home. Oh well, I just threw caution to<br>
the wind, packed everything back up and hit the trail. A little over<br>
an hour later, we stopped to have a rest and a nibble. <br>
<br>
The juicy orange slices and delicious German chocolate cookies (love<br>
that Trader Joe's) were calling my name. I opened my pack to get them<br>
out when I realized that the cool little insulated sack they were in<br>
was no longer in my possession. I had left it on the trail, miles<br>
back. Then I realized that my prescription sunglasses were in that<br>
bag, too. Oh, no! What to do? <br>
<br>
DMS, gentleman that he is, offered to go back with me if I decided<br>
that it had to be done. We looked at our water bottles: almost empty.<br>
We looked at our watches: almost sunset. We looked at ourselves:<br>
wobbly, dilapidated messes. We couldn't possibly add another three<br>
miles to our day. So we proceeded back down to the trailhead, leaving<br>
the snacks and glasses for the bear whose scat we'd seen on the trail<br>
earlier in the day. Just for drill I left my name and phone number<br>
with the camp host at the parking lot. We hadn't seen but two other<br>
hikers the entire day and the likelihood of someone finding my<br>
precious stuff before the bear did was nil... or so I thought. By the<br>
time I'd driven the forty miles back to my house, my little black bag<br>
was safely in the hands of the host. A distinctly non-ursine trekker<br>
had found it, eaten all the treats and turned it in. <br>
<br>
BTW one toenail went black but didn't fall off, just got lumpy. The<br>
hike is hard but wonderful, especially the thousand year old vision<br>
quest pits you see near the first box. Doubletree's stamps are so nice<br>
that we did the same killer hike the very next week for that pesky,<br>
elusive box that was just ten minutes farther up the trail from our<br>
first  "I give up" point. The clue has since been amended and the<br>
correct distance noted. Ruckel Creek comes highly recommended. Just be<br>
sure to trim your toenails before you go. <br>

Well, we have left our sig stamps out on the trail more than once.  When we<br>
were in Connecticut, we were doing several boxes on the same trail, so we<br>
noticed by the next box that we were missing something important!  A quick<br>
(or not so quick) trot back to the previous location to scoop up our stamps<br>
laying on the ground in their baggie, then onward again...  Unbelievably I<br>
think this happened at least twice.<br>
<br>
... and then we also left them at a box in a cemetery in our own town.  It<br>
wasn't near a grave, but instead on a rock ledge, and since it was the only<br>
box we were doing that day we didn't realize we had forgotten them.  Luckily<br>
other LBers were at the same box later on the same day and recognized our<br>
stamps.  They notified us via email before we even knew they were missing.<br>
That means we luckily didn't have to deal with panic and rushing back to a<br>
cemetery.  We received them in the mail before our next outing the following<br>
weekend.<br>
<br>
We also lost a compass in Pennsylvania, which meant we had to find a store<br>
that sold them. Luckily it was in a fairly populated area and it only took<br>
us two stops to be successful.  We now always carry TWO compasses, one in<br>
each of our packs and also keep one in our car.<br>

I've lost a nice pair of designer sunglasses that I picked up in<br>
Mexico.  I was sad to lose that one.  I'm quite sure some rafters in<br>
another group picked them up after me, but I never saw them again.<br>
<br>
I also had a not so pleasant "find" in that same location--maybe that<br>
could be next week's TOTW: what have you found while letterboxing.<br>

"What have you lost while letterboxing?"<br>
<br>
<br>
Back in March when we were having all that snow and very cold <br>
weather here in Portland, I went looking for a mystery box with <br>
Maiden1974 and her kids after I got off of work.  We were poking <br>
around some rocks and had just found the box when my car keys fell <br>
out of my pocket.  I thought I knew right where they had fallen in <br>
the rocks and determined I would get them after I stamped in and was <br>
putting the box back.  When I put the box back, I couldn't find them <br>
anywhere.  They weren't where I thought they were.  I looked around <br>
all the rocks nearby.  Nothing.  Maiden came along and helped me <br>
move some impressively big boulders and still no keys.  We poked <br>
around with my hiking stick only to come up empty handed.  We <br>
finally determined they had fallen down this really deep crevass in <br>
between some rocks and into the creek.  I kissed my keys goodbye <br>
right then and there.<br>
<br>
But that's not the end of the story.  I had to call my husband to <br>
come and bring me the extra set of keys.  He's not too hip on <br>
letterboxing, and I hadn't told him I was stopping for this one, so <br>
not only did I have to confess that I'd been letterboxing, I had to <br>
ask for help.  He was home sick with a migraine, but he drug himself <br>
out and drove 40 miles (in the snow, at rush hour, on a Friday) to <br>
come and rescue me.  Luckily, my husband is a very smart man and <br>
thought to stop and buy a long magnet on a rope and was able to fish <br>
my keys out of the long, dark hole they had fallen in.  <br>
Surprisingly, a couple of hours in the near freezing water didn't <br>
hurt my electronic door lock opener.  In fact it works better now!<br>
<br>
I was grounded from letterboxing for two weeks.  :-)<br>
