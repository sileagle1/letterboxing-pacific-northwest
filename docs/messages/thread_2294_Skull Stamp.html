again, I don't really go thru the logbooks that thoroughly. I just <br>

I had to go over and read that - sheesh what a lot of speculation! <br>
Sounds like even if someone knows who it is they aren't about to tell.<br>
 Looked like the best bet for finding out if someone really wanted to<br>
would be a comparison of the log books that were all on the table at<br>
the bathering in the very hot weather, NY I think - described in one<br>
of the posts - and then figuring out who was sitting next to whom. <br>
Might need a gathering to even DO that...<br>

These stamps have been seen on the east coast as well.It was stamped  <br>
into my log on one of the back pages when I wasnt looking at the may  <br>
day gathering.I have also seen it in 2 of my traveling <br>
stamps'logbooks,both times on the same page as Wanda and Pete and both <br>
times the skull was slightly different than the others so there is <br>
more than one floating around.It was stamped into my tattooed woman <br>
log at a MD gathering.The skull reminds me of "the punisher"skull.<br>
