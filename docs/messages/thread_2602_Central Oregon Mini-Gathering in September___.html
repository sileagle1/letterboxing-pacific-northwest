<br>
Funhog led us here and we're glad of it... glad to have joined the site.<br>
<br>
We've planned a "Central Oregon 'Meet and Greet' Mini-Gathering" on <br>
Sunday, September 24th at the Camp Sherman Campgrounds. The gathering <br>
is listed on the Atlas Quest site. Here is the link...<br>

<br>
We are new to letterboxing and look forward to meeting other boxers in <br>
our area. Hope you can make it.<br>
