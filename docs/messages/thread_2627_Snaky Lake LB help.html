<br/>
Just wanted to post a request for help.  I'm getting numerous 'could <br/>
not find' reports on our letterbox series at Snake Lake in Tacoma--<br/>
although somebody reported all 3 alive &amp; well on 31 July 06.  If <br/>
anybody happens to be headed out there could you please check on <br/>
these LBs and see if they're still viable.  I'm not sure if it's <br/>
because the boxes are indeed missing or if it's because folks new to <br/>
the hobby are attempting the series immediately after learning about <br/>
the hobby and aren't quite sure what to look for.  I appreciate any <br/>
help folks can provide with these boxes--they were never intended to <br/>
be difficult boxes but rather 'training boxes' for letterboxing <br/>
courses sponsored by the nature center there.  The <br/>
numerous 'missing' reports are starting to make me think that the <br/>
boxes have been yanked or vandalized--even though the staff at the <br/>
center fully endorse them being in the park.  If there are problems <br/>
with them, I'll just retire them to preclude folks from the <br/>
frustration of not finding boxes in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That would be so awesome if you could check on them!!!  I've added <br/>
some more details to the bottom of the clues on AQ to help better <br/>
pinpoint if you're in the correct spot for the boxes.  I'm not sure <br/>
if the staff has even found the boxes since we planted them for <br/>
their class, though.  However, the 3 boxes were wholly endorsed by <br/>
the center so it would be odd if they pulled them for some reason--<br/>
unless serious maintenance on the boxes was needed.  The last <br/>
finders of all 3 boxes found them on 31 July--so it seems a bit odd <br/>
that they'd all 3 be missing so soon thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any &amp; all help you can provide me with these!<br/>
