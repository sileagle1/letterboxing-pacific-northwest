&gt; I'll be there this coming week and was planning on looking for this<br/>
&gt; box, unfortunately, just now when I went to print the clue... <br/>
there's<br/>
&gt; no clue there!  I'm not getting the error message that I get from <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; LbNA site... anyone know what's going on?  Anyone have the clues <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; can share? (before tomorrow noon-ish if possible...that's when <br/>
we're<br/>
&gt; heading out from Portland to Shasta in a straight shot and then <br/>
slowly<br/>
&gt; back up to be home by next weekend... so fun!!)<br/>

this<br/>

I was wondering if there was another, second issue... or maybe<br/>
Erfellie took it down...<br/>
Too bad for me, although I have so many clues printed for the areas<br/>
we'll be in that there's no way I can get to them all... not in one<br/>
week anyway!<br/>

Atlas Quest only allowed you to upload a single picture with a clue,<br/>
so I'm not sure this is actually an AQ clue. Some people might upload<br/>
the photos somewhere else (even the AQ photo gallery) then post a link<br/>
to it, but an actual AQ clue won't have more than one photo.<br/>
