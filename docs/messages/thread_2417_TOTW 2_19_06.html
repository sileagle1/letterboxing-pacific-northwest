planting a box, one must also think about where NOT  to plant. <br/>
<br/>
It's so important that we have not invaded  anyone's 'personal space'. <br/>
Putting it another way, if there is paraphernalia  suggesting homeless people are in <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Your soap box is much appreciated. :o) One of the boxes I couldn't find was in an area <br/>
which had been, I think, pristine, but had obviously been recently taken over by some very <br/>
incosiderate people--there were so many snack food wrappers, cans, and broken bottles <br/>
that I was actually afraid of getting hurt, so ended up not searching the entire area.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I'd suggest is that people ask themselves a few questions before placing a <br/>
box in any high traffic areas.  Some of the urban ones are great *because* they are in high <br/>
traffic areas, of course; but I think one needs to ask the question, "Could anyone come up <br/>
with a good reason for being here OTHER THAN letterboxing?"  Obviously if you leave one <br/>
in a shop with the owner or whatever, you can be subtle about getting the box.  I found <br/>
one, though, that was in a sort triangular area between residential streets that didn't have <br/>
much cover, and I kept thinking, "What reason could I give for being here, if asked?"  I was <br/>
careful, but if anyone happened to be looking out their windows, they could easily have <br/>
seen me.<br/>
<br/>
I'd personally also ask the question, "Will someone be glad they came here?"  Most of the <br/>
letterboxes I've found have been placed in locations where the answer to that question <br/>
would be a resounding "YES!" but there have been a couple where I felt like, "Why the heck <br/>
did they plant a letterbox HERE?"  Not a complaint, really, just an observation.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also thinking about Poison Ivy's great letterbox ranking system (which can be found on <br/>
Mark and Sue Pepe's blog).  One of the things he mentions in this incredibly funny bit is a <br/>
box which has instructions that take you all over the place, but ends up being 20 feet from <br/>
where you parked your car.  Those kind of boxes make me start foaming at the mouth <br/>
after I've found them, especially if I've gone past many really great hiding places that <br/>
would have made more sense.<br/>
<br/>
Before I get off of *my* soap box, I'd also suggest that planters consider whether <br/>
something mentioned in the clues is going to be there later--small trees and the like <br/>
might end up being casualties of winter storms in certain areas, so keep them out of the <br/>
clues unless they are extremely sturdy.  And if you are including cryptic clues, make sure <br/>
to spell things properly...&amp;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's just my opinion, and I hope I haven't offended--just want to get the <br/>
maximum fun out of this pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I'll do once I've got a spot I like is to get the coordinates and then<br/>
check to see where the nearest geocaches are. As someone who started in<br/>
geocaching, my pet peeve was people who would find the letterbox and<br/>
assume they'd found the cache and log it- when in fact they never had<br/>
found what they were *really* looking for. (And in one case, kept logging<br/>
a cache that had gone missing, which certainly didn't let the owner know<br/>
it was missing.) Of course as a letterboxer, it's annoying  on a number of<br/>
levels... probably most annoying when a geocacher who's never even heard<br/>
of letterboxing sees the hand-carved stamp and says ooooo! Cool swag! And<br/>
swaps a muddy golfball for it. Sigh.<br/>

Um, why not? You're flaming geocachers. Why isn't turnabout fair?<br/>
<br/>
There's equally many stories of geocaches exposed by letterboxers<br/>
placing boxes near existing caches, even ones where the geocache<br/>
'disappears' and a letterbox 'mysteriously' ends up hidden in the<br/>
exact same spot.<br/>
<br/>
And I've certainly seen indications that some letterboxers are equally<br/>
clueless... Writing stuff like 'Hey, where's the stamp?' in a logbook<br/>
in a container that's not hidden where the boxing clues say it is and<br/>
is nothing like what's been described. Letterboxing does not magically<br/>
grant intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Why create an 'Us vs. Them' dichotomy when everyone is playing<br/>
essentially the same game, just with different details?<br/>

<br/>
That is not flaming. A flame would be something like "Geocachers are<br/>
worse than Nazis!" Stupid attacks that resort to nothing better than<br/>
name-calling.<br/>
<br/>
Saying geocachers have been known to swipe stamps out of a letterbox<br/>
inadvertantly is a fact. Sure, it doesn't put geocachers into a good<br/>
light, but it's hardly a flame either. Nor does it mean all geocachers<br/>
go around swiping stamps out of letterboxes--but it's a simple fact<br/>
that it has happened in the past and it will happen again in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, you're response doesn't even justify the label of<br/>
'flame'.  Letterboxers could find a geocache and not know the<br/>
difference, but the difference is that a letterboxer doesn't go around<br/>
taking the logbook out of the cache. (Of course, you are expected to<br/>
take an item, so you can't really complain if a letterboxer does that!)<br/>
<br/>
So there can certainly be ignorance from both sides of the fence, but<br/>
a letterboxer that finds a geocache generally does it no harm. A<br/>
geocacher that finds a letterboxer, that's not always the case. It's<br/>
not a blanket statement about either side, these are facts.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't get inflamed about the lack of flames--if you want to see<br/>
some real flames, check out the archives of the main talk list. Those<br/>
have some real heat!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">thanks Ryan,  I was trying to say that I have had stuff like that happen<br/>
plenty of times while acknowledging that I know responsible, good<br/>
letterboxers.  I know people do bad things with them on both sides.  For<br/>
instance, not rehiding one well so it goes missing immediately--we all have<br/>
seen this happen.  I cannot believe that we would knowingly take away a box<br/>
or a cache on either side so we could replace it with our own in the same<br/>
spot.  It would have to be coincidence.  If I realize there is a cache<br/>
nearby, I try to avoid it because there is so much more traffic with<br/>
geocaching and I don't want my box inadvertently exposed and the logbook<br/>
filled up with "found this looking for a geocache" comments while only a few<br/>
are able to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
I can respect geocaching as an activity.  I was just commenting on the fact<br/>
that history has shown that if your letterbox is in a high geocache<br/>
concentrated area, there's a good chance there will be problems. It just<br/>
happens on occasion.  I don't think we often realize that there are<br/>
geocaches in an area until it is too late and vice versa.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ref Letterboxing vs Geocaching:  The difference between letterboxing <br/>
&amp; geocaching is that the stamp is absolutely 'critical' to the <br/>
letterbox.  If the stamp goes missing, it does not count as a 'find' <br/>
(referring to the LBNA FAQ for what constitutes a find, plant or <br/>
exchange) as an impression of the stamps can not be exchanged. If <br/>
the logbook goes missing but the stamp remains, you can always stamp <br/>
your signature stamp on a sheet of paper and leave it in the <br/>
letterbox and still get 'credit' for the find. <br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
In geocaching, it still counts as a find if you locate an empty <br/>
container--you've still essentially 'found' the cache and can log it <br/>
as such--you can even do some quick maintenance by adding some paper <br/>
for a new notebook and toss in a few trade items and it's back in <br/>
business. That's why it's so frustrating for letterboxes when the <br/>
stamps go missing (not to mention the extra effort it takes to <br/>
recarve the stamp, return to the location and replace it).  It's <br/>
rare when folks are able to 'repair' a letterbox on the spot when <br/>
the stamp goes missing because folks generally don't carry carving <br/>
material with them on the trail and if the stamp goes missing, they <br/>
usually have no idea what the original looked like.  So getting it <br/>
back in 'business' is more difficult.  <br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are 'problem' participants from both hobbies--believe me, <br/>
if you've participated in these hobbies for more than a few weeks <br/>
you'll experience it.<br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
I'm almost game to recommend that geocaches become 'hybrid' <br/>
letterboxes that incorporate stamps just so the awareness level of <br/>
the importance of the stamp remaining in the container is elevated.  <br/>
If you delve into the genesis of geocaching you'll see that its <br/>
original intent was to be a new, more technical twist on <br/>
letterboxing (study the letterboxing-usa yahoogroup's early messages <br/>
to see this).  What happened though was a fallout between <br/>
the 'founding fathers of US letterboxing' and the 'father of <br/>
geocaching' (who at one point was a letterboxer) regarding <br/>
who 'controls' or 'owns' the clues of planted letterboxes and <br/>
whether they should all be incorporated into the 'then newly <br/>
emerging geocache database.' The disagreement over this is was <br/>
created the schism between the hobbies and geocaching morphed into <br/>
what it is today--completely separating itself from the 'stamp' <br/>
aspect of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
As both a letterboxing &amp; geocaching enthusiast (who's planted &amp; <br/>
found many letterboxes &amp; geocaches), I try to raise awareness about <br/>
both hobbies on both sides of the aisle whenever I'm afforded the <br/>
opportunity.  I challenge parties on both sides of the aisle to do <br/>
the same.  I've even had great success working with geocache owners <br/>
in creating hybrid geocache/letterboxes along the way, too.  So it <br/>
is possible to happily co-exist (&amp; even cross-polinate for that <br/>
matter!)<br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
Personally, though, I've had more problems with stamps disappearing <br/>
from our letterboxes that were eventually found in geocaches when <br/>
unknowing cachers swapped them out for coins or bits of polished <br/>
glass/stones than I've experienced with missing 'logbooks' from our <br/>
geocache.  I have discovered remnants of hitchhiker letterboxes <br/>
and 'resident letterbox' stamps in geocaches, though--and only <br/>
recognized them as such because we'd previously found the said HH or <br/>
the resident letterbox and it instantly caught our eye.<br/>

This commentary is not meant as an inflammatory response.  It seems <br/>
lately, however, that just expressing an opinion on any of these <br/>
boards incites some sort of angry response. As if this board is a <br/>
tinderbox or something.  Sad!  :(  I'm hoping this 'quick-to-anger' <br/>
tendency is a result of cabin-fever and not anything else because <br/>
this board used to be our 'refuge' from all of that bickering that <br/>
was so common on the letterboxing-usa board. <br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
Please view this response as just an attempt to encourage both <br/>
letterboxers and geocachers to individually do their parts to raise <br/>
awareness of the different hobbies amongst their friends from the <br/>
respective communities so as to reduce the friction the two hobbies <br/>
that is obviously occurring.  Truly there are much more important <br/>
things in life than to quarrel over things like this.  Obviously <br/>
participants in both hobbies share similar passions for exploring <br/>
outdoors and following some sort of clues to a 'surprising' result.  <br/>
It's odd that it's so difficult for the two 'bodies' to get along.  <br/>
And no--the previous posts weren't 'flameworthy'--check out the <br/>
letterboxing-usa board from late August 02-October 02 and a few <br/>
other nuclear-fallout-episodes after that.  Those were not 'glory' <br/>
times WRT to this hobby.  Just remember though that not everything <br/>
you see in this hobby is what it really is--some of those fallings-<br/>
out were 'baited' and folks actually fell for it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; That is not flaming. A flame would be something like "Geocachers are<br/>
&gt; worse than Nazis!" Stupid attacks that resort to nothing better than<br/>
&gt; name-calling.<br/>
<br/>
Ah. Excessively generalized claims that paint an entire group with a<br/>
broad brush based on the actions of a few is not flaming. I stand<br/>
corrected. This was a stupid joke that was nothing better than<br/>
stereotyping, not flaming.<br/>
<br/>
Um, wait a minute....<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Saying geocachers have been known to swipe stamps out of a letterbox<br/>
&gt; inadvertantly is a fact. Sure, it doesn't put geocachers into a good<br/>
&gt; light, but it's hardly a flame either. Nor does it mean all geocachers<br/>
&gt; go around swiping stamps out of letterboxes--but it's a simple fact<br/>
&gt; that it has happened in the past and it will happen again in the future.<br/>
<br/>
And yet the ignorant actions of a few is used as a way of attacking an<br/>
entire group, a great many of whom also participate in letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I've found letterboxes hidden in holes dug by the hider. I've found<br/>
ones placed then abandoned to eventually become trash. I've found ones<br/>
hidden without permission on what was likely private property. The<br/>
list goes on. Does that put letterboxers in a good light? Should I<br/>
ridicule an entire group for the actions of a few who I *know* do not<br/>
represent the whole?  And to continue my list, I've found caches that<br/>
had similar issues. Again, there is no need for this false dichotomy.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Additionally, you're response doesn't even justify the label of<br/>
&gt; 'flame'.  Letterboxers could find a geocache and not know the<br/>
&gt; difference, but the difference is that a letterboxer doesn't go around<br/>
&gt; taking the logbook out of the cache. (Of course, you are expected to<br/>
&gt; take an item, so you can't really complain if a letterboxer does that!)<br/>
<br/>
Um, yes you can and yes they could. If there's a geocacher ignorant<br/>
enough to not know what letterboxing is and too rushed to read any of<br/>
the information on or inside the container, they might think they<br/>
found a cache and the stamp is a trade item. But I would be amazed to<br/>
learn of anyone participating in the sport who 'traded' for a logbook.<br/>
That would require a completely different level of ignorance. I think<br/>
you need a better analogy.<br/>
<br/>
The letterboxers who find a cache and do not read the information<br/>
inside telling them what it is are just like the geocachers who don't<br/>
do so when they find a box. And sadly, in a specific instance I'm<br/>
thinking of, by not doing so they missed out on locating the letterbox<br/>
30 feet away.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So there can certainly be ignorance from both sides of the fence, but<br/>
&gt; a letterboxer that finds a geocache generally does it no harm. A<br/>
&gt; geocacher that finds a letterboxer, that's not always the case. It's<br/>
&gt; not a blanket statement about either side, these are facts.<br/>
<br/>
And you see, there's that attempt to create differences when it's not<br/>
necessary. There's only a 'fence' if you keep insisting on building<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
In honor of the Winter Olympics, I'll offer my own analogy.<br/>
Letterboxing and geocaching are like ice skating and rollerskating.<br/>
Sure, some of the equipment and details are different, but many of the<br/>
techniques remain the same. One would not expect generalized jokes and<br/>
insults on some ice skating list because some noob somewhere tried to<br/>
wear their rollerblades onto the ice.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Please don't get inflamed about the lack of flames--if you want to see<br/>
&gt; some real flames, check out the archives of the main talk list. Those<br/>
&gt; have some real heat!<br/>

One of the reasons I'm on this list and not the national one is<br/>
because I thought it might include a group less prone to rampant<br/>
stereotyping and hostility towardsa part of their community. Perhaps I<br/>
was wrong, but I hope not.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks Ryan,  I was trying to say that I have had stuff like that happen<br/>
&gt; plenty of times while acknowledging that I know responsible, good<br/>
&gt; letterboxers.  I know people do bad things with them on both sides.  For<br/>
&gt; instance, not rehiding one well so it goes missing immediately--we all have<br/>
&gt; seen this happen.  I cannot believe that we would knowingly take away a box<br/>
&gt; or a cache on either side so we could replace it with our own in the same<br/>
&gt; spot.  It would have to be coincidence.  If I realize there is a cache<br/>
&gt; nearby, I try to avoid it because there is so much more traffic with<br/>
&gt; geocaching and I don't want my box inadvertently exposed and the logbook<br/>
&gt; filled up with "found this looking for a geocache" comments while only a few<br/>
&gt; are able to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, it appears that in at least one instance it was quite deliberate.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you find this so hard to believe? You're quite willing to<br/>
believe stupidity and ignorance on the part of geocachers, why not<br/>
hostility and arrogance on the part of some letterboxer somewhere in<br/>
the world?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can respect geocaching as an activity.  I was just commenting on the fact<br/>
&gt; that history has shown that if your letterbox is in a high geocache<br/>
&gt; concentrated area, there's a good chance there will be problems. It just<br/>
&gt; happens on occasion.  I don't think we often realize that there are<br/>
&gt; geocaches in an area until it is too late and vice versa.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; -who should know better than to comment on this particular topic<br/>
<br/>
History shows that if you place any container in a spot with a high<br/>
level of activity there *may* be problems. But I can also think of a<br/>
geocache and letterbox we found a couple feet from one another and<br/>
located at an extremely busy beach access point. I think the only<br/>
reason either survives is because the casual observer thinks they are<br/>
trash. The seem to have co-existed reasonably well.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt the experienced folks can match every story of<br/>
geocache/letterbox problems with a similar one of peaceful<br/>
co-existence. And vis versa, for that matter. We tend to remember<br/>
stories and incidents that support our preconceived notions. That's<br/>
why psychics are successful; those who believe remember the one<br/>
correct prediction, not the hundred wrong ones.<br/>
<br/>
If you approach the sport with an Us vs. Them attitude, you'll see the<br/>
differences a lot more than if you view the whole group of us as a<br/>
single community that's really a little cracked; after all, we all<br/>
spend an inordinate amount of time mucking about in the woods looking<br/>
for pieces of Tupperware...<br/>

No, the ignorant actions of a few is used as a way of attacking the<br/>
ignorant actions of an ignorant few. Nobody is attacking all geocachers.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But I would be amazed to learn of anyone participating in the sport<br/>

&gt; different level of ignorance. I think you need a better analogy.<br/>
<br/>
That's kind of the point. Ignorant letterboxers who find geocachers<br/>
cause fewer problems than ignorant geocachers who find letterboxers.<br/>
This isn't to paint all geocachers as bad (which you really seem to<br/>
want to think everyone is going), but rather the ignorant few who<br/>
cause problems.<br/>
<br/>
Get over it. Chill, dude. If you aren't an ignorant geocachers, we<br/>
don't care. It's the ignorant few that we have problems with. That's<br/>
not a flame, it's a fact.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh, but of course. If there's a few bad people on a list, then it's<br/>
perfectly okay to stereotype everyone on the list in the same broad<br/>
stroke.<br/>
