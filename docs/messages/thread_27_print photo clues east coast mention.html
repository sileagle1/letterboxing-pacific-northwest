We prefer the more politically correct term "historically representative of<br/>
the under one minute mapsurfer carving period".  Of course, this is double <br/>
jeopardy, as I've already taken abuse on these stamps from the His Eminence<br/>
himself :-)<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, those stamps are better than some that were going on in<br/>
a certain unspeakable east coast former English colony at the time.  There <br/>
was a school of thought in those days that the place and the clues are all <br/>
that mattered, and the stamp was a necessary evil.  With the advent of <br/>
geocaching shortly thereafter, that school was annihilated and the stamp<br/>
necessarily came to prominence in letterboxing ...<br/>
<br/>
... leaving those of us remaining from that school to have to wade thru a <br/>
lot of butt ugly clues :-)<br/>
<br/>
(of course, those clues are butt ugly also, but that is a different kettle<br/>
of fish.  My stamps these days are acceptable, and I've been going thru and<br/>
upgrading all the old ones ... so you have a piece of letterboxing history ...)<br/>
<br/>

*laughing*  Well, if it's any consolation, I've only seen one of your <br/>
stamps, but it's FAR better than Amanda's first stamps.  Those were a <br/>
sorry sight.  I still have nightmares about them occasionally.  =)  <br/>
But as everyone here knows, she's improved dramatically and has since <br/>
even gone to the effort of replacing a few of those older stamps <br/>
(when they've gone missing) with new and improved versions.  I'm <br/>
almost half-tempted to go out and make sure the rest of those ugly <br/>
stamps "go missing" so they'll need replacements.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Of course, this is double jeopardy, as I've already taken abuse on<br/>
&gt; these stamps from the His Eminence himself :-)<br/>
<br/>
Muaaahh?!  I've been very vocal about my love for a great stamp and <br/>
even try to provide help for people to reach their potential, but I <br/>
usually try to refrain of picking on any individual stamp or person <br/>
unless it's myself--or Amanda, who I know will forgive me!  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; of course, those clues are butt ugly also, but that is a different<br/>
&gt; kettle of fish.<br/>
<br/>
Now that's a can of worms I'm not going to open.  But I tell you, I <br/>
thought of some of your scary looking clues while creating such <br/>
beauties as the Applegate Rest Area letterbox <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/OR/Applegate) and even my <br/>
newest Walking Tour letterbox <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/CA/WalkingTour).<br/>
<br/>
I so wish some of you folks could get my Walking Tour letterbox.  It <br/>
is by far the coolest letterbox I've ever hidden, but I can't tell <br/>
you why without spoiling it for others that DO get the letterbox!  <br/>
You can't tell it from the clues, but it's the kind of box that'll <br/>
become legendary in California!  =)  But the large assortment of <br/>
numbers crowding up the page seems very Mapsurferish to me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; PS -- I hereby challenge the Ryan's claim of "world's uglist stamp"!<br/>
<br/>
I've never claimed to the the world's ugliest stamp!  Nope, I don't <br/>
believe that honor goes to me (or you, for that matter--sorry, but <br/>
I've seen uglier!).  I only claim to have the world's crappiest, and <br/>
Crappy Stamp Letterbox part 2 is in the works.  But since I want to <br/>
spread the crap around, it probably won't be in the Pacific <br/>
Northwest.  I'm thinking one in California.  And I've got ideas I'm <br/>
working on for a couple of crappy stamps to put out east.  =)<br/>
