What's the buzz on the Der Mad Stamper's PCC Sylvania Campus boxes?  If I go <br>
a-huntin' tomorrow am I likely to find something or come up empty?  Anybody <br>
tried for them recently???<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We tried for this series a long, long time ago and only found one box.<br>
I think the second one was called missing, but no telling if it really<br>
was or not.  We only found the first one, but tried for them all, I<br>
think.  It's been years, though, so I'm not a very reliable source.<br>
Chances are the first box is still there, but you'll have to try at your<br>
own risk.  You know how this sport can be. Sometimes they are there and<br>
sometimes they are not.  Also...I think you have to pay to park at PCC<br>
now.  Wasn't always the case, but I think it is now, unless you park off<br>
campus.  Good luck!<br>

P.S. Does this mean your adventures in Ohio are over?<br>

Yup, Wild Child & I are back, having left a few boxes in our wake.  Now I'd <br>
better get busy carving those stamps I claimed I'd plant in time for the McIver <br>
gathering.  Hmmm, maybe while sprawled on on a blanket during the Blues <br>
Fest...<br>
