                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have several temporary boxes that I put out for the summer that I<br>
will be retiring at the end of August.<br>
The Evil Spring and its bonus box will be retired in at the end of<br>
this week.<br>
Also, the first three Marmots ,Marmots Everywhere boxes. There will be<br>
more Marmots planted later.<br>
Also, I have just retired the Donkey Baseball which I have been<br>
threatening to retire since I made it.<br>
If there is one of these boxes that someone feels they really need to<br>
get, send me an e -mail and I can leave the box out a few more weeks.<br>
