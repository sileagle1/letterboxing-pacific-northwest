First and foremost, thanks to everyone who came to the gathering and to everyone for the heaping thanks for the cooking. I enjoyed the gathering more than I can say and I love to grill, so I was in seventh heaven!  We're planning on doing some kind of House Warming/Letterbox get together on Sept at Rainbow Falls State Park after we move into our new house, but we'd be happy to wait till after one in Oregon, we need the excuse to get down to that area!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Next time I provide the burgers, I'll do one better than just frozen patties, they'll be the secret family recipe.   As far as the potato salad goes, it's pretty simple really, though most of the time, RayvenMom cooks by instinct rather than recipe...<br/>
<br/>
Peel and boil potatoes to the point that they are still firm and not mushy, remember to add salt to the water so you don't have to add it later to<br/>
   the salad<br/>
Add mayo enough to give it a creamy but not dry texture (some people like the Kraft salad dressing mayo... we prefer the deep south mayo)<br/>
Add sweet relish to taste<br/>
Add yellow mustard to taste<br/>
And this is the kicker.... RayvenMom adds sugar to counter the slight bite that the mustard tends to offer...<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, the potato salad is pretty straight forward to make!<br/>
<br/>
Now as far as the new site at http://www.myndworx.com it's already progressing along.  We've got forums for discussions, and a gallery for photos and the DB is being programmed as we speak, we, not as we speak, I'm writing this, not coding, but you know what I mean!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now for the SitRep:<br/>
<br/>
Wingnut and RayvenMom went off at the event to get the stamp at the Tumwater Historical Park, they were successful in that. After the event, Team Rayvenhaus along with Wingnut and Crewe headed off to the Tumwater Falls Park for the letterboxes there, and we've bad news... dvn2rckr, you're box has been vandalized.  We were able to find the canister and the log book, but the stamp has moved on to a better place and is no longer with us!  We pulled the remnants with us as the place where it was hidden was also vandalized... We'll mail it to you, just send us your snail mail address off list and we'll fire it off to you asap.<br/>
