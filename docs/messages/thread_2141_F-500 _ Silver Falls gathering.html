decided Portland, Oregon was the place to go for our vacation this <br/>
year. With over 100 boxes listed in the city alone, we thought we'd <br/>
have a good shot. We hiked about 30 miles in all, we figure, one day in <br/>
pouring rain--BUT we were able to get some much sought after boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Lucky for us, as a bonus to our trip, there happened to be a gathering <br/>
in the area (Silver Falls) and we added 32 exchanges to our logbooks <br/>
too! What a wonderful group of people we met and boxed with. I'll tell <br/>
you, we aren't much the camping types but we really regret not planning <br/>
for at least one overnight with this bunch! Der Mad Stamper, Wingnut, <br/>
Funhog, Maiden, J-Rock Family, Paisley Orca, Wild Woman, Double Tree, <br/>
Heather and all the kid-stampers, Lil Bug, Button, Emily, Paw and Nose <br/>
in a Book and all the rest of you, it was such a pleasure to meet and <br/>
box with you you!<br/>
<br/>
We're positively HOOKED on Der Mad Stamper's clues and got Mad Mallard, <br/>
Der Saintly Stamper Series, Evil Genius, Lost Letterbox and #1 of the <br/>
Cedar Hills Twins and Spirit of Dartmoor. We found Funhog's 45th <br/>
Paralell and Beneath the Blue #2 and 3, Paisley Orca's Who Let The Dogs <br/>
Out series and Fort Canby series, and many, many more.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all you wonderful carvers and hiders for making this such a <br/>
memorable and exciting vacation!<br/>
