                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have done some updating to my Schmitz Park clues. The Squirrel is <br/>
back with a new and improved stamp. Unfortunately, when I went to <br/>
replace the squirrel, I found that the Schmitz Park #1 box was also <br/>
missing. I had replaced this box 3 times already, so I have gone <br/>
ahead and retired it after a nearly 3 year run (It was originally <br/>
planted in June of 2001). Thanks to everyone who visited and enjoyed <br/>
the Original Schmitz Park 3 letterboxes. Schmitz Park is now home to <br/>
two letterboxes and I have revised the clues to reflect this change. <br/>
(I have also shortened the walk a bit)<br/>
<br/>
So if you are coming over to West Seattle to find some of the new <br/>
boxes over here, you might want to drop by Schmitz Park and stamp <br/>
into the NEW and IMPROVED squirrel!  I also saw some hitchhikers in <br/>
the area!<br/>
<br/>
Also be aware that there is a geocache in the park that has multiple <br/>
waypoints. One of those waypoints is close to the Schmitz Park <br/>
Squirrel, so please please please rehide the box very well and be <br/>
discreet when you are stamping in. Thanks so much!<br/>
