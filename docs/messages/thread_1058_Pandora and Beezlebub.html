letterboxing by a mere wind chill factor of zero degrees! We had a letterboxing date <br>
today and were gonna keep it, no matter what! <br>
<br>
Figuring Pandora's Powell's letterbox to be a good choice for a day like today, we <br>
began our quest in the nice warm confines of the largest privately owned bookstore <br>
in America. We opened the doors to the box's hiding place, prodded and poked. No <br>
letterbox! Highly disappointed, we decided to move on to Plan B. I think we now know <br>
that B stands for Bad but we hadn't figured that out yet.<br>
<br>
We headed down to Pioneer Courthouse Square, four pages of clues in our hands. <br>
This was not for four letterboxes, mind you, but for the one measly box that Ryan so <br>
thoughtfully hid for our boxing pleasure. After a good thirty minutes standing out in <br>
the arctic blast deciphering the first part of this evil clue we ran into the conveniently <br>
located Starbuck's and guzzled hot drinks. <br>
<br>
Reinforced, we headed on to the next stopping point on this frigid tour. Conveniently <br>
enough, we'd been sent to the wrong location by Mr. Carpenter. We figured out where <br>
we were really supposed to be shortly.  Snow dust skittered down the street as we <br>
began to work on the next section of this hideous clue. About a third of the way <br>
through, I noticed that my dripping nose had left a frozen trail on the front of my <br>
coat. We looked at each other, looked at the remaining two and a half pages of code <br>
and decided that this was entirely enough. Beezlebub and his nefarious clue would <br>
have to await another day.<br>
<br>
A much better plan was a stop at Dan and Louis Oyster Bar for chowder and blueberry <br>
pie. Yum!!! Our grand finale was a bookbinding session in the warmth of my very <br>
messy kitchen. There were no new stamps in our logbooks today but we each ended <br>
the afternoon with a cool new book to put inside yet another letterbox somewhere, <br>
someday. <br>
