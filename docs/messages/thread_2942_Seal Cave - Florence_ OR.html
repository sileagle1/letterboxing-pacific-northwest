One place we haven't been yet is the Seal Cave in Florence. So we will<br>
be heading there before we leave.  I can find lots of great boxes for<br>
Florence but nothing at the Seal Cave..... does anyone know of a WOM<br>
box there?   I just figured it would be a place that someone would<br>
have planted a box at :)<br>
<br>
We have LOVED boxing in the PNW and will be sad to say good-bye to it!<br>
