I have taken to bringing along a few blank index cards.  At times <br/>
that I do not feel like carrying my log book and my dd's log book, <br/>
(both are rather large and heavy) I just stamp a card and tape it in <br/>
my book later.... this is nice also when you are doing a series, and <br/>
maybe don't find them all in the beginning, (you can put them <br/>
together when you get them all) or run into other boxers along the <br/>
trail and have a different place you log exchanges in at.  <br/>
<br/>
I also kinda scrap book my journal, so it lets me play a bit an add <br/>
photos and things I find along the trail into my log book too! :) <br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine new to boxing had a neat idea.  They were looking <br/>
for their first journal, and ran across one of those inexpensive <br/>
photo albums...   the little 4x6 ones, they stamp cards and they <br/>
slide into the album in what ever order they wish, and can add photos <br/>
and tokens in the pages also.....  I was thinking I may do this next <br/>
time!  I am almost in need of a new journal myself...  <br/>
