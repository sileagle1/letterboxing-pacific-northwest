<br/>
   I just joined your Yahoo group and thought I'd introduce myself. <br/>
I live in Puyallup with my hubby and 2 children, Elizabeth - 3 and <br/>
Thomas - 5 months. My little girl has really been into pretending to <br/>
be a pirate lately. She often drags me off to some corner of the <br/>
house to show me where she has found some "hidden treasure" (costume <br/>
jewelry I let her play with). So when I read a snippet in the most <br/>
recent issue of Family Fun magazine and went online to find out what <br/>
this "letterboxing" thing was, I instantly got hooked! Imagine <br/>
Elizabeth's excitement (and mine, too!) when I told her there was <br/>
real life treasure hidden in our favorite parks just waiting for us <br/>
to find!! We've found our first two boxes and can't wait to go find <br/>
more. <br/>
<br/>
   I'm so wildly grateful that this wonderful pastime/sport/hobby <br/>
exists. To be honest, I often find other things to do with our time <br/>
rather than going out on a walk and enjoying the beauty God gave us. <br/>
There is always housework, classes, work, friends and a host of <br/>
other things on my to-do list. Going for a walk rarely makes it into <br/>
our schedule. Letterboxing has now vaulted nature walks and "treasure<br/>
hunting" up in the top of our priorities and I pray that it stays <br/>
there for years to come. What a gift we've been given!<br/>
<br/>
   I would very much like to give back by planting some boxes for <br/>
other folks to find, and I'm wondering if you have any tips for a <br/>
newbie. The first 2 boxes we found had something written in them, <br/>
but we were so excited to stamp our books and replace the box <br/>
without being seen that we didn't take time to read it. Should I <br/>
have something written inside my box to explain what it is, incase a <br/>
non-Lb'er finds it? If so, what kind of things have you seen in or <br/>
written in letterboxes you've found/placed? Any other ideas would be <br/>
welcome! Thanks again and happy letterboxing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome Shelli and Family to the wonderful world of letterboxing!<br/>
First of all, my best advice would be to find some more boxes! This <br/>
is the best way to see how others have done a letterbox and how it <br/>
should be labeled, camoflauged, baggied, etc. Then I would check out <br/>
this site:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers,<br/>
and the FAQ's section of the letterboxing.org site.<br/>
<br/>
If you still have questions, which you probably won't because this <br/>
should give you all the information that you need and then some, we <br/>
would be glad to help you out.<br/>
Welcome again to this wonderful hobby and I hope to meet you <br/>
sometime at a local gathering. Happy Hunting!<br/>

&gt; Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Shelli, I want to welcome you as well.  It is so nice to read about<br/>
that initial excitement in finding your first few boxes.  You express<br/>
yourself so well, I really enjoyed reading your post.  Camp Fire Lady<br/>
gave you good advice.  Hope to see you around - maybe on the trail!<br/>
