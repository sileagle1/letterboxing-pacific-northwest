series.  Great stamps and what a cardio workout! :)  One small word <br/>
of caution: the nettles are out in full force at this time of year, <br/>
and the second box, the Pixie Witch, is basically surrounded.  The <br/>
location of the third box isn't quite so bad, but the areas where you <br/>
might be tempted to sit to box in are pretty infested as well.  Keep <br/>
an eye on the kiddies or dogs if you go after these this time of year.<br/>
<br/>
As a beginner, all the Carkeek stamps have been a joy to find.  I'd <br/>
recommend all of them to any beginner and to anyone who wants to <br/>
enjoy the beauty of a typical Seattle park.  Visitors would probably <br/>
especially like Eliza B's series since it has a great view of Puget <br/>
Sound on the hike up the hill.  And the stamps are a great variety by <br/>
some really talented folks.  Keep up the good work! <br/>

Glad you liked them... though it seems that my boxes always end up planted in nettle-infested areas! Sorry about that. <br/>

It could be worse--they could have been planted in poison-oak <br/>
invested areas!  The Paisley Orca will tell you about a certain <br/>
letterbox some cretin hid in a forest of poison oak--and unlike <br/>
nettles, you may not know about it until days later!  At least with <br/>
nettles, you'll KNOW you're in them and can extract yourself before <br/>
too much damage is done!  =)<br/>
<br/>
-- Ryan, and I swear I didn't realize there was poison oak on Angels <br/>
Rest!<br/>
