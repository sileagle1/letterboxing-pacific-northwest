Upon consultation with the mild-mannered piper, (who was not<br>
enthusiastic about the <br>
idea of driving  for 6 hours and then putting up a tent), Team Garlic<br>
will be staying at the <br>
Best Western in Sublimity, a few miles away from the park. We can<br>
drive in and hang out <br>
with everyone and letterbox all day, and then return to beds and<br>
showers. We will arrive <br>
Saturday, and stay over Saturday and Sunday nights, so we have some<br>
time to enjoy the <br>
park. <br>
<br>
We have all enjoyed Stamp Camp so much that I couldn't stand to miss<br>
this one, no matter <br>
how far away it is!<br>

It will be nice to see your family at Silver falls. If you dont <br>
remember me from the gresham gathering, I'm the one who shared <br>
the "kissing cootie" and had a celtic horse stamp. Sandi and I really <br>
liked meeting you all, you seem like a very sweet family :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings all! I have been thinking about hiding new boxes for the campout at Silver <br>
Falls, the first weekend in July. After digging through the heap of mail on my desk <br>
yesterday, I unearthed the trail map that Ranger Jim Bader sent me. On it he has <br>
highlighted the trails that he recommends for us to use for hiding letterboxes. You <br>
can see a copy of this map in the Files section of this page. <br>
<br>
As attractive as the Trail of Ten Falls is, it already has a series of boxes hidden along <br>
it. The traffic on this path is intense during the summer and it would be very difficult <br>
to go undetected hunting for boxes. The staff at the park would love to see some of <br>
the other trails get more attention. Perhaps we can help! I'm headed out there soon to <br>
do my part. Perhaps some of you will want to do the same.  Funhog<br>

I just want to replace the letterboxes that are missing! I definitely<br>
have no intention of adding MORE boxes that I can't maintain on a<br>
regular basis!  =)<br>

This is my first post!!! I'm hoping to come to the gathering @ the <br>
falls.  Fun Gal and hopefully Handyman and Ginky will come as well.  <br>
So 4 more for the party!  My friends don't seem to be as drawn to all <br>
this fabulous fun as I.  So I am looking forward to meeting some of <br>
the faces behind the names, or nicknames of the clever artists whose <br>
masterworks we've been collecting for a year and a-half.  Our first <br>
box was Funhog's Discovery Trail.  I'm glad to know that She will be <br>
there(hello!) How will we find the group?  When is the <br>
potluck/exchange? Saturday I hope, because that is when I think that <br>
we would come.<br>

Looking forward to it -- Wildhair<br>

As far as the clues go, most people that plan to plant boxes will do it<br>
ahead of time. For instance the Brat Pack is going down tomorrow to take our<br>
offerings. (Pray for no rain). We'll have our clues all typed up and ready<br>
to go before we get there.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree. KK's that don't add to the poundage. Who knew? <br>
Then, there was the brilliant clue offering from the <br>
mysterious duo, Miller and Hutch, that appeared magically <br>
in the wee hours of the morning. Hats off and keep it up. <br>
Your oevres are a very special treat. I also can't wait to see <br>
what comes of those intriguing fortune cookies that <br>
appeared at the potluck.<br>
<br>
I feel so lucky that I live in the PNW. We have such a great <br>
variety of interesting, creative letterboxers of all ages. It <br>
was wonderful to see so many kids (young and old) engrossed <br>
in carving, resulting in a rash of wonderful new personal <br>
travelers appearing over the weekend. Watching the event <br>
stamp come to life in the hands of Der Mad Stamper under <br>
the stars was another highlight. Green Tortuga's campfire <br>
recitation of the works by Robert Service were another <br>
held everyone's attention. The hogs wallowing in the <br>
dust enacted by Thunderbird and Thundereagle will make <br>
me laugh forevermore.<br>
<br>
One of the things I enjoy most is that every box you find <br>
in this part of the country is almost guaranteed to have a <br>
hand-carved stamp in it and the boxes hidden for this event <br>
were no exception. The gift of someone's artwork left in the <br>
wild is a very special kind of communication. Yes, I'm one of <br>
those curmudgeons who feels pangs of disappointment when <br>
I open a letterbox and find a store-bought stamp inside. I'd <br>
always prefer to find a crudely crafted first attempt at carving <br>
than something made by a machine. Many thanks to those who <br>
created a letterbox for this weekend and every other <br>
letterboxing trip I have taken in the past, not to mention the <br>
ones looming in my future.<br>
<br>
It was a joy to see friends old and new, some traveling from <br>
hundreds of miles away. I do hope that everyone had at least <br>
half the fun that I did. That way I know that everyone had a <br>
total blast. Funhog<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we couldn't say much more than what everyone else has said.  This was <br>
our first gathering, we thoroughly enjoyed it, and we couldn't stop talking <br>
about it, even as we rolled into our driveway on Whidbey Island at 9pm. <br>
Here are some of our highlights.<br>
<br>
Being so utterly nervous approaching the potlucking crowd - it's scary <br>
meeting new people in groups.  Folks were quick to speak to us and welcome <br>
us, and we were excited to meet the personalities behind the names we've <br>
been seeing around since we began doing this in March.<br>
<br>
Silver Falls is such a beautiful park that we will have to return, I feel in <br>
several trips.  There was so much to see that we didn't have time to, even <br>
without the letterboxes we didn't have time to locate.  Thundereagle and I <br>
secretly plotted to be on the trail past campground check-out time so that <br>
we would have to pay for another night, but Scot the chauffuer reminded us <br>
he has to work today.  I would come back any day of the week to sit at the <br>
waterfall Funhog so magically showed us.<br>
<br>
It's so nice to see the families doing this hobby together.  So many things <br>
these days appeal to a narrow range of people, and it was lovely to see both <br>
parents and children enjoying the hobby.  The kids were such a joy, so <br>
polite, so friendly, and so much fun.  We particularly enjoyed Button, <br>
Downhillsk8ter, and the Team Garlic kids.  Laura was having so much fun <br>
playing, she didn't care about the stinkin' Krispy Kremes.  Scot the <br>
chauffuer, though he doesn't letterbox, really loves the scenic and quiet <br>
beauty of the places the hikes take us, and he thoroughly enjoyed the <br>
conversation in Group Camp.  I hear Green Tortuga tells a mean story, but I <br>
didn't hear it because I was too busy enjoying conversation with Pungent <br>
Bob, Funhog, Woodaug, Slo-Mo, and Maiden.<br>
<br>
We learned so much about the finer layers of this wonderful hobby, and were <br>
glad to learn of the legendary Miller and Hutch.  What a great experience! <br>
Thanks so much for your kindness.  We look forward to the next opportunity <br>
at Liberty Lake.<br>
