However, I revised my opinion yesterday when I headed to Mount Hood CC to track <br/>
down this darling bevy of lost pups. Halfway through the series, I totally wimped out!<br/>
<br/>
The hike was so easy and boxes so close together, that I couldn't warm up in between <br/>
them. The east wind was howling and branches were tumbling down all around me. I <br/>
felt like I was inside a gigantic swamp cooler. When I captured the pooch named Ice, I <br/>
realized his name described perfectly the condition of my fingers. This realization <br/>
also clued me in to the fact that the essential ingredient for a Funhog...fun...was <br/>
eluding me. I headed home knowing that a cup of hot chocolate was in my future.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon, I headed back and rounded up the remaining four truant canines. The <br/>
winds had calmed; the  temperature had risen a couple of degrees; and fun was in the <br/>
air. Being Winter break, this is the perfect time to search for these little doggies. The <br/>
campus is totally empty and I never saw another human being. Just remember to <br/>
bring that thermos of hot chocolate. Thanks, Sleepy Whippet, for a cute series in a <br/>
quiet spot. Funhog<br/>
