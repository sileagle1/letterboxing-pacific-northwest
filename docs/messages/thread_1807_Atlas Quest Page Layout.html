Hi! I noticed the new christmas layout (its cute) :o) but I just <br/>
wanted to throw in my useless two cents, I really like that Green <br/>
Tortuga put in the image of the 2 driedels in the lower right corner <br/>
of the page. I spent hours and hours and hours playing that game <br/>
every hannukah of my childhood. I was fortunate enough to be raised <br/>
by a rabbi for 10 years of my childhood, thus the name "Erfellie <br/>
(Shachar)" its Hebrew for Misty(Dawn). Since my mother passed away 3 <br/>
years ago our family split up and we no longer celebrate hannukah so <br/>
it was a nice little reminder of times past. Thanks Green Tortuga<br/>
 :o)  <br/>
P.S.  And for those who don't know, the dreidel reads "Nes Gadool <br/>
Haya Shem" which means "A great miracle happened there" (referring to <br/>
the biblical Maacbees).  If anyone wants to learn to play: its a <br/>
gambling game sort of. You can bet buttons, pennies, nuts, or <br/>
anything really. After spinning it depending on the letter facing <br/>
upwards upon dropping you take that action. Everyone puts in lets say <br/>
1 penny into the "pot" doesnt matter the number of players. If it <br/>
lands on "Nes" (looks like a backwards C) the spinner wins nothing. <br/>
If it lands on Gadool (kind of looks like C with a tail on the right <br/>
side) the spinner Gets everything penny in the pot. If it lands on <br/>
Shin (wierd looking W) the spinner must Share, and put one penny in <br/>
the pot. If it lands on Haya (kinda looks like alowercase "n") the <br/>
spinner gets Nothing and its the next players turn. Winner is the one <br/>
who wins all (or most) pennies at the end.  Happy hannukah, by the <br/>
way :o)<br/>
<br/>
