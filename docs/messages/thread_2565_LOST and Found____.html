Please let me know if you run across either of these items. Both are hard to<br/>

  &gt; Hi Star gazers,<br/>
  &gt; I am missing a couple items. A compass which I think I left at<br/>
  Maryhill<br/>
  &gt; Museum on one of the tables in the peacock area. It's small (2"<br/>
  sq) and<br/>
  &gt; black. I'm hoping someone in the group found it. There were<br/>
  several people<br/>
  &gt; up there hunting when we left.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; The other item is a . . . well for lack of a better term a<br/>
  bottle fob. On<br/>
  &gt; one end is a loop for going over the neck of a regular store<br/>
  bought water<br/>
  &gt; bottle the other end has a carabiner for hooking to your pack.<br/>
  It's only<br/>
  &gt; about 4" long. I'm not sure but I may have left in your van,<br/>
  Maiden. ?????<br/>
  &gt; I forgot my water bottle in there - not sure if the fob was on<br/>
  it.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Please let me know if you run across either of these items. Both<br/>
  are hard<br/>
  &gt; to<br/>
  &gt; replace. I'll pay postage or meet you somewhere - whatever is<br/>
  convenient.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; We had a great time at the gathering. Really enjoyed everyone.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Oh, and neener-neener-neener - we found Paisley Orca's Lb at the<br/>
  museum.<br/>
  &gt; FunGal has a good eye - she gets all the credit.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Thanks for the fun!<br/>
