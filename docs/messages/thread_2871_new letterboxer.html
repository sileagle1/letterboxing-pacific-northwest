Welcome to letterboxing LJ, hope to see you on the trail someday.  I<br>
want to express my condolences for the fact that you have to buy<br>
textbooks - those things are WAY more expensive now than they were<br>
when I had to buy them a million years ago.  If you get the itch to<br>
meet other letterboxers, just post here and people will undoubtedly<br>
respond to you - that's how I met up with someone my first time.  I<br>
for one usually box alone or with a friend of mine in Gresham,<br>
DoubleTree, and we would love to meet you, as I'm sure would others.  <br>

be addicting, as so many of us will tell you!  <br>

I just wanted to introduce myself and say hi. I just started hunting <br>
letterboxes over winter break, mostly in my neighborhood in SW. I have <br>
been really enjoying it. Thats all I guess, I am heading out on a <br>
pedestrian expedition to buy text books for next term and find some <br>
boxes. <br>
Happy New Year<br>
