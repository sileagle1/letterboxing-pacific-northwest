The Bishops Close Letterbox which is one of Funhogs, is a beautiful <br/>
garden and yes salamanders.  Also we see salamanders at the Nature <br/>
Park all the time!!!!!!  Too fun that we enjoy such an activity to <br/>
be outside looking for boxes but yet see so much wildlife too, how <br/>
exciting. We love to see all different things but wouldn't like to <br/>
run into a bear.  My brother tells me scary stories of him being in <br/>
the wild and hearing "things".....no thank you not for me, I will <br/>
stick to Salamanders and cute Otters in the river!!!!!!!!<br/>
 We Letterboxers are very lucky people!!!!!<br/>

Rattlesnake <br/>

land, <br/>
