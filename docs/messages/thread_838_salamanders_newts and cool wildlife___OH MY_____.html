The Bishops Close Letterbox which is one of Funhogs, is a beautiful <br>
garden and yes salamanders.  Also we see salamanders at the Nature <br>
Park all the time!!!!!!  Too fun that we enjoy such an activity to <br>
be outside looking for boxes but yet see so much wildlife too, how <br>
exciting. We love to see all different things but wouldn't like to <br>
run into a bear.  My brother tells me scary stories of him being in <br>
the wild and hearing "things".....no thank you not for me, I will <br>
stick to Salamanders and cute Otters in the river!!!!!!!!<br>
 We Letterboxers are very lucky people!!!!!<br>
