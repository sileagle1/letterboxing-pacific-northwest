                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, everyone! I just wanted to say thanks and congratulations to all <br>
the people who have registered already for the big 10th anniversary <br>
letterboxing celebration! I'm SO excited! It's really starting to hit <br>
me... just how collosal this event is going to be!<br>
<br>
We opened up registration yesterday afternoon, and the results were <br>
absolutely amazing! We sold out of Deluxe Accomodation rooms in less <br>
than 10 minutes! Registration forms were pouring in all afternoon and <br>
evening. I could not believe what a great response we got from people <br>
all over the country! This gathering is going to be everything we <br>
ever dreamed it could be!<br>
<br>
Of course, I realize there are some people who wanted to sign up but <br>
simply weren't near a computer on Saturday. Don't worry... there are <br>
still a few spots open! But don't delay, because they're going fast! <br>
To make your reservation, go to www.WeLiveAndBreathe.com<br>
<br>
I also want to give a special shout-out to my fellow planning <br>
committee members who have worked so hard to make this registration <br>
such a huge success... particularly Buppsters, Camp Fire Lady, <br>
Marmalade, and RaqsEnigma who were all on-hand yesterday to help <br>
process and organize the torrent of applications.<br>
<br>
Of course, the planning committee's job is not complete. We will be <br>
working our butts off over the next seven months to pull everything <br>
together and make sure that this event lives up to everyone's <br>
expectations. If you haven't signed up yet, you'd better get on the <br>
ball! This is one party you're not going to want to miss!<br>
