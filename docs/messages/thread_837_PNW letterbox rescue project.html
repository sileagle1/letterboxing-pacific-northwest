                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good afternoon. Since I've got a (favorite) sister in Portland and <br/>
her boyfriend letterboxes, can I be an honorary member? I know: too <br/>
many Californians up there already! During this glorious fall season <br/>
I'm taking some time to ask a favor of you all. You will recall that <br/>
when we changed over to the new automated LbNA website we took a lot <br/>
of time to make sure all the old letterbox clues got transfered over, <br/>
including boxes which are "Unclaimed" by their creators.<br/>
<br/>
This presents a bit of a dilemma to us. The obvious problems are with <br/>
box maintanence. If nobody takes responsibility for these boxes, lots <br/>
of wasted trips will be spent looking when they eventually go <br/>
missing. There are other "webmasterly" problems I'd be glad to <br/>
discuss in more detail if anyone is interested.<br/>
<br/>
Since you have such an amazing community of letterboxers there in the <br/>
great Pacific Northwest, I thought you might be interested in trying <br/>
to adopt all the Unclaimed boxes from the lists. If you're willing to <br/>
accept responsibility for a letterbox, you might try contacting the <br/>
placer and getting them to register with LbNA. If you're not able to <br/>
find them, or if they respond with "I'm out of the 'boxing business," <br/>
you could be a real box angel if you were to adopt the clues and <br/>
maintain the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If you could eliminate all the UnclaimedBoxes from your area, maybe <br/>
the nation as a whole could do the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
To find a list of the Unclaimed boxes near you, go to <br/>
letterboxing.org and click on "search for boxes." Choose a state and <br/>
the placer named "Unclaimed" from the pull down lists, then <br/>
click "search boxes." <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you'd like to give any of these orphans a new <br/>
home. My address is drewclan at aol dot com.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! Jay in CT<br/>
