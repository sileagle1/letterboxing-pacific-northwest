                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday was a gorgeous day in Portland. My newfound letterboxing<br/>
pal, Heyokahman and I planned a morning rendezvous at Portland Kayak<br/>
Company. This place is conveniently located on Macadam Blvd, near<br/>
John's Landing. We left there rolling a canoe in tiny wheels down the<br/>
sidewalk towards my favorite Super Fund site, the Willamette River. We<br/>
rolled down to the Willamette Park boat ramp and launched out into a<br/>
section of Portland's water world.<br/>
<br/>
Our destination was Ross Island, home to a large nesting colony of<br/>
Great Blue Herons. Along the way we marveled at the architectural<br/>
potpourri of  houseboats at Oaks Park, the sight of mergansers and<br/>
raptors on the islands, and the sight of a gigantic cement pipe. Could<br/>
this be the headwaters of the Super Fund Willamette? On the island we<br/>
found deer prints and lots of pudgy, warm and very sweet blackberries.<br/>
Oh! there was that cool Big Cranky letterbox, too! <br/>
<br/>
At a leisurely pace this whole trip out and back took about an hour<br/>
and half and cost only fifteen bucks for the canoe rental. It's a<br/>
highly recommended way to savor a beautiful morning. It reminded me<br/>
why I am so lucky to live in the Pacific Northwest, not to mention to<br/>
be alive. Thanks, KuKu for the nudge...<br/>

Oh that sounds wonderful! I grew up on the water, but I don't get out <br/>
there often enough anymore. I forget how easy it is to rent a boat <br/>
here in Seattle too.<br/>

Northwest)<br/>
So...you all want some water. Give us a shout if ever,<br/>
you are planning on coming near Vancouver. We are on<br/>
the water. We do have a couple of kayaks (free<br/>
rentals)**wink**, also pedal boats and I think a<br/>
couple of canoes and planty of letterboxes nearby!<br/>
(one water access only for sure, two others you could<br/>
access by water if you choose). To calrify we are<br/>
'not' a business, jsut a family on the water that<br/>
enjoys letterboxing and it's community of people.<br/>
It is so lovely to get out on the water.<br/>
So give us a shout. We Canadian letterboxers are very<br/>
thankful to the brothers and sister south of us that<br/>
have introduced letterboxing to this part of the continent.<br/>
