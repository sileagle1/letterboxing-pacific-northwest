Found your Pencil and Bill the Robot boxes on Monday in Wonderwood Park.<br/>
Pencil is my favorite. Both are in good condition and well hidden from view.<br/>
Keep up the good work Mo.<br/>

power was out, all over the neighborhood.  If I wanted, I could come in<br/>
later.  So I did!<br/>
<br/>
Went to Lois Lake Park and Nature Trial, was first at Jo the Alien, Fresh<br/>
Fruit, and the Carrot.<br/>
<br/>
Still some time left, so went over to Wonderwood to get the Pencil and Bill<br/>
the Upside Down Robot (at least that is how he is in my logbook :-(<br/>
<br/>
Very nice stamps, great locations.  Recommend them highly to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Good job, Mo!  Looking forward to more of your good work.<br/>
<br/>
Was first in Lois Lake, but was behind Bill and Glenn at Wonderwood Park.<br/>
Nothing to be ashamed of following such expert 'boxers.<br/>
