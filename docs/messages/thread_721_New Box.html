                    <div class="plaintext-content">Saturday, while hunting for a lake deep enough to get the boat wet and a quiet spot to enjoy the mountain; Trillium and Timothy too crowded, Frog full of Boy Scouts, we determined the best option would be to stay at Clear Lake, carry the canoe down to the water and just putz around.  So, on the drive back to Clear, we saw the sign for Sahalie Falls and Umbrella Falls and decided we had to stop, and very glad we did. We hiked up and decided they both needed letterboxes, I was tempted to drop one at the Pioneer Woman's Grave, too but we only had one container kit with us so I chose the easier one.  So after we set up camp, canoed and ate, I carved the Umbrella box.  After we tired of Clear Lake, we dropped the box at around 2pm when I stupidly twisted my ankle.  Then went up to Timberline Lodge, hoping for a beer in the bar and we have a box to place there too, but alas, the crowds were horrendous, so we said hi to Bruno and left.   <br>
 <br>
It was a beautiful and restful weekend albeit carrying the canoe from the campsite down to the lake and back up again.  (Though we are the Mudstumpers, we were not crazy about walking the boat out below the boat ramp in the muck.) <br>

there was a Sahalie falls near Mt. Hood. Maybe you can continue your series in that area. We <br>
also have a canoe. Have you tried any Lakes in Central Oregon?<br>

Only Hosmer so far.  Too ,bad it's not the same one.  But that's good too, the more the merrier!  We honeymooned on Wallowa Lake in July and will be going there every chance we get.  Perfect canoeing conditions and the water temp is fab for rolling the canoe!<br>
