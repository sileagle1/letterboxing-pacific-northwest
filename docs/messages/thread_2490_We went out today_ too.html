                    <div class="plaintext-content">I packed the kids in the car and we headed to an area where a large number <br/>
of boxes reside.  The problem with boxing with young kids, though, is that they <br/>
don't necessarily want to spend the entire afternoon looking for every last one.  <br/>
And it doesn't help motivate them when the first four (from a series) all have <br/>
basically the same stamp!  They actually mutinied after the fourth box we <br/>
found in that series, and refused to look for the others.  By that time, they <br/>
weren't even interested in finding others in the area not related to the series.  <br/>
((sigh))<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.  At least we got out and enjoyed the day!<br/>
