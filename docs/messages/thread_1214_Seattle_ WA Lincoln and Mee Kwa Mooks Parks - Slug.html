&gt; Hi all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A friend told me about letterboxing last week. Until then, I'd <br/>
never heard<br/>
&gt; of this marvelous pastime. After reading about how it works, I <br/>
became quite<br/>
&gt; excited about trying it out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I stopped by my local rubber stamp store to buy supplies for making <br/>
stamps.<br/>
&gt; And whom should I meet, but the moderator of this group, Ryan! He<br/>
&gt; graciously took me under his wing and gave me some great tips for <br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; started. Thanks Ryan.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So my wife, our Airedale Terrier Keegan and I set out to find the <br/>
Mee Kwa<br/>
&gt; Mooks Low Tide box and then on to Lincoln Park for Amanda's two <br/>
boxes and<br/>
&gt; Seattle Mud Puddle Trotter's 3 box series.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As we got ready to go, I of course couldn't find my find my <br/>
personal stamp<br/>
&gt; I'd carved. Twenty minutes later, I had another stamp carved and <br/>
out the<br/>
&gt; door we went.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We successfully found the Mee Kwa Mooks Low Tide box. It's in good<br/>
&gt; condition and has a very nice handmade journal. It's down to its <br/>
last few<br/>
&gt; pages though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mountain bike through this park as well as Lincoln Park and never <br/>
even<br/>
&gt; knew letterboxes were hidden within. Cool!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then it was off to Lincoln Park. Keegan got to chase lots of <br/>
squirrels as<br/>
&gt; we searched for the five total boxes hidden about. The first up was<br/>
&gt; Amanda's box #1. We found the 4-in-1 clue. I assume the box is <br/>
supposed to<br/>
&gt; be in the crotch of the 4-in-1 but I couldn't find it. This one <br/>
could be<br/>
&gt; MIA.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We found box #2, the Vashon Island Ferry, alive and well. What a <br/>
beautiful<br/>
&gt; place to see the ferries and the Puget Sound.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then it was on to Mud Puddle's series of three boxes. #1 Clover box <br/>
was<br/>
&gt; found with some difficulty, but worth the hunt. It's a two-sided <br/>
stamp.<br/>
&gt; Nice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #2 Stump box was a bit easier to find. It's on a trail I mountain <br/>
bike<br/>
&gt; every time I ride the park. Amazing. Someone had written in the #2 <br/>
journal<br/>
&gt; that they believed the #3 Slug box has gone missing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I easily found the general area where the Slug box is supposed to be<br/>
&gt; hidden, but was unable to find it. I am not sure if it's MIA or I <br/>
was just<br/>
&gt; not diligent enough in my searching. Anyone bagged this one lately?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So all in all not a bad day. Four out of six. I'll take it for <br/>
being a newbie.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See you on the trail.<br/>
