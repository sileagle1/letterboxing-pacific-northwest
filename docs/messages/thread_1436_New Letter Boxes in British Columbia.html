Golden Ears is one of the largest provincial parks in British Columbia,<br>
encompassing an incredible 55,590 hectares of mostly undeveloped wilderness.<br>
In the 1920s, the forested slopes of the valley became the site of BC's<br>
greatest railroad logging operation until a disastrous fire swept through<br>
the valley in 1931. It is also one of, and possibly the most popular park in<br>
the province. The park was named after the twin peaks of Mount Blanshard,<br>
which shine gold from the setting winter sun. Golden Ears lies in the Coast<br>
Mountains, north of the mighty Fraser River. It extends 55km north through<br>
untamed mountain wilderness to an impenetrable barrier of mountain peaks and<br>
steep-sided valleys that separate it from Garibaldi Provincial Park.<br>
Second-growth forests of western hemlock, western red cedar, and Douglas fir<br>
cover much of the landscape. At higher elevations, forests give way to<br>
alpine meadows and, at even higher elevations, permanent snowfields.<br>
