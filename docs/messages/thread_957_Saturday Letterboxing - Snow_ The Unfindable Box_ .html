                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well Iron`Bear and I have made it a new habit of going out boxing <br/>
with CampFire Lady and Cats Meow every Saturday, boy are we enjoying <br/>
ourselves too.  We had SimKitty with us yesterday, which made for a <br/>
whole group of letterboxing fun<br/>
<br/>
First we headed out to the Washington Park area.  We nabbed Girl <br/>
Scout Cookies and Tribute and then we made a run at Wonderful Tour.  <br/>
Unfortunately we didn't do so good with this series as we could never <br/>
find any of the first clues for a starting point couldn't find the <br/>
tour guide (Tree) or the gift to man (Fire) and sure could not find <br/>
Zeus's retarded lightening bolt.  But we hiked a good way trying to <br/>
find it and pretty soon we found ourselves in the falling snow.  It <br/>
was quite an experience being out hiking while the snow was falling. <br/>
It was cold too.  The kids were complaining a lot so we called it <br/>
quits with the intention to go back and look another day.   <br/>
<br/>
Next I walked over to the Children's Museum to replace Puff the Magic <br/>
Dragon in the Fate of Childhood Series.  Seems the tree that Puff was <br/>
hiding at had been pruned and they took Puff with him So I replanted <br/>
him in a different location, the clues have been updated and anyone <br/>
that wants to go get Puff, he is waiting for you.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we headed over to the location for Mary's Little Lamb.  Several <br/>
people wrote and said they could not find this box, and I even asked <br/>
Funhog, who had found all 12 boxes to go have a look and confirm it's <br/>
status for me.  She confirmed it was missing so I re-carved it and we <br/>
headed out to replant.  Funny thing though, when Iron`Bear went to <br/>
stick Mary's Little Lamb in the appropriate hiding place; he could <br/>
not do it because something was already there! Ummm the original <br/>
letterbox you guys will just have to look a little harder I suppose. <br/>
But you are in the right place.  I hold Funhog responsible for <br/>
confirming the box missing and causing me to re-carve it, silly Hog <br/>
but really I am only saying that so she might feel guilty and give me <br/>
a little bit more of a hint on Sleight which is driving me nuts!!<br/>
<br/>
Next we headed up to Pitock Mansion, had a lunch that gave a whole <br/>
new meaning to the "Cold Lunch" your mom use to offer you for taking <br/>
to school and then had another go at Sleight.  Even with 5 of us we <br/>
still didn't find it.  That box must be hidden pretty well!  <br/>
<br/>
Then we headed out to Gabriel Park to have a go at The Murder <br/>
Mystery.  We came up empty handed trying to find the location of the <br/>
body, and took a detour to go visit the Wetlands to the Woods <br/>
Letterbox.  This is where my day started to turn and I started to get <br/>
a bit grumpy.  You see I haven't found a hitchhiker hidden in a <br/>
letterbox since I moved from California, and I only found one there.  <br/>
The rest of my Hitchhiker count are ones I have planted myself, or <br/>
ones that were mailed to me to get them moved to a different <br/>
location.  So here we are going for Wetlands to the Woods, I might <br/>
mention that nobody in our letterboxing but I knew the box was there, <br/>
nor did anyone but I have the clues for it.  So sweet pandora, always <br/>
eager to help out, I told CampFire Lady, Cats Meow and Iron`Bear <br/>
about this box and we decided to have a go at it.  So we are walking <br/>
along the trail, and we come to the hiding place and I say "I would <br/>
check that log right there in that hole." And CampFire Lady asks <br/>
me "This one?" "Yeah that one." I say, sure enough she pulls the <br/>
letterbox out.  Go Team!!  Yeah well one little hitch, (pun intended) <br/>
There was a hitchhiker in the box! Probably the coolest one I have <br/>
ever seen too.  And I squealed like a pig with excitement that I had <br/>
found my first hitchhiker! But you know what they would not let me <br/>
take it with me! They insisted they found it! The stole it from me I <br/>
tell you stole it!! And I whined for like 30 minutes about it and <br/>
they were not even sympathetic.  I thought I would open a poll on the <br/>
group and see who the group thought the should have gotten the hitch <br/>
hiker, but alas, I would hate to ruin a good friendship by turning <br/>
everyone against the thieves in question, so I will just let it go <br/>
and smile knowing that they would never have gotten either the box or <br/>
the hitchhiker if it hadn't been for me.  But it taught me a good <br/>
lesson never let someone else look where you think the letterbox is! <br/>
Look yourself just in case folks!  <br/>
<br/>
So a still pouting pandora and the rest of the group then headed back <br/>
to have another go at looking for the body funny thing though we <br/>
crossed this bridge taking a short cut that seemed just like the ones <br/>
in the clues, so we did some investigating and by goodness we found <br/>
that homeless man Art.  He gave us some more clues during the <br/>
interrogation but alas it was dark and we had to start heading back.  <br/>
We plan to hit Gabriel Park and continue our search again next <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your weekend was as fun as mine was  even if I did pout for the <br/>
larger portion of the end of the day!<br/>

<br/>
You were grumpy because you were PMS'n. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; letterbox out.  <br/>
<br/>
Sweet Pandora fails to mention that the clues state that you need a <br/>
flashlight to find this box and since I was the one with the <br/>
flashlight Of course I looked in the hole for the box and pulled it <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; There was a hitchhiker in the box! Probably the coolest one I have <br/>
&gt; ever seen too.  And I squealed like a pig with excitement that I <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; found my first hitchhiker!<br/>
<br/>
Folks, Sweet Pandora did not find this hitch hiker. It was in the <br/>
bottom of the box after I took out the logbook and stamp and Sweet <br/>
Pandora asks, "What is that?". She had no idea it was a hitch hiker <br/>
until I showed it to her.<br/>
<br/>
 But you know what they would not let me <br/>
&gt; take it with me! They insisted they found it! The stole it from me <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; tell you stole it!! And I whined for like 30 minutes about it and <br/>
&gt; they were not even sympathetic. <br/>
<br/>
OH MY GOSH DID SHE WHINE!!!<br/>
<br/>
but alas, I would hate to ruin a good friendship by turning <br/>
&gt; everyone against the thieves in question, so I will just let it go <br/>
&gt; and smile knowing that they would never have gotten either the box <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; the hitchhiker if it hadn't been for me. <br/>
<br/>
Sweet Pandora fails to mention AGAIN that she had plenty of help from <br/>
me and Cat's Meow to find Trefoils- Girl Scout Cookie and Tribute <br/>
since she could not find the clues for Tribute and I so graciously <br/>
gave her my clues.<br/>
<br/>
 But it taught me a good <br/>
&gt; lesson never let someone else look where you think the letterbox <br/>
is! <br/>
&gt; Look yourself just in case folks!  <br/>
<br/>
Good tip Pandora. Put the cigarette out and look for the box <br/>
yourself. ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So a still pouting pandora and the rest of the group <br/>
<br/>
Mind you, a very guilty feeling Camp Fire Lady at this point-<br/>
<br/>
&gt; to have another go at looking for the body funny thing though we <br/>
&gt; crossed this bridge taking a short cut that seemed just like the <br/>
ones <br/>

<br/>
WAAAA, WAAAA, WAAAA! No hard feelings though. I would never let a <br/>
little hitch hiker (that is in my possession of course) come between <br/>
my friendship with Pandora and Iron Bear. They are the coolest people <br/>
to letterbox with and me and Cat's Meow always look forward to going <br/>
out with them. By the way, the name of the hitch hiker is The Lost <br/>
Chapter created by Delphinius Monk and Pandora is right, it is one of <br/>
the coolest looking stamps and logbook I have seen. Thanks Pandora <br/>
and Iron Bear for another great letterboxing experience!<br/>
