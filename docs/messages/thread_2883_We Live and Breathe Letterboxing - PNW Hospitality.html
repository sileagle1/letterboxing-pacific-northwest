big celebration for the 10th anniversary of American letterboxing. It <br>
will likely be one of the largest letterboxing events of the <br>
decade... not to mention one of the most fun!<br>
<br>
This is a great chance for us to show off our special brand of <br>
Hospitality! There are going to be lots of out-of-towners who want to <br>
come a few days early or stay a few days after the event and check <br>
out some of the beautiful sites to see in the Northwest. But we all <br>
know how expensive hotel rooms can be!<br>
<br>
If any of you have a spare bed or couch that you'd be willing to <br>
consider letting someone crash on for a few days, there is a special <br>
Yahoo! group where you can post such an invitation and work out the <br>
details. <br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NeedaBedGottaBed<br>
<br>
I know the event isn't until September, but registration begins in <br>
February! Lots of people are trying to make decisions right now about <br>
whether or not they can afford to attend this event. So, please, open <br>
up your heart and home... make a new friend or two, and help out the <br>
letterboxing community at the same time! Let's show everyone why the <br>
PNW is such a great place for a celebration of this magnitude!<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
Mitch, Der Mad Stamper<br>
