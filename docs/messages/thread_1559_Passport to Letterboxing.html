<br>
Despite Ryan's comment, it sounds to me like the Passport to<br>
Letterboxing was a rousing success and that Pandora and the Gang did a<br>
bang up job!  I had a pretty good idea that I wouldn't make it to this<br>
event, which is why I didn't commit.  With the way this busy summer has<br>
been for me I'm lucky to have made it to at least one letterboxing<br>
event, albeit a small one.  I'm very sorry to have missed Der Mad<br>
Stamper.  It's been years since I saw or spoke to my Letterboxing hero!<br>
<br>
Congratulations on a successful letterboxing and rescue effort in<br>
Battleground!  Letterboxers coming together for each other again!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For the record, Passport to Letterboxing was just about the most fun <br>
I've had since I started calling myself a letterboxer!  The whole <br>
event was a dream come true for me.  It was exactly the sort of thing <br>
that Erik the Vermont Viking, Daniel, and I were envisioning when we <br>
started this whole thing six years ago!  It was a community of <br>
people... of all ages and from all walks of life... sharing an <br>
intriguing, multi-faceted experience together... camping, hiking, <br>
carving, stamping, laughing, caring... and communicating!  Wow!  I <br>
get goosebumps when I think about it!  The Spirit of Letterboxing is <br>
alive and well in the Pacific Northwest!<br>
<br>
It occurs to me that letterboxing has grown to become a genuine means <br>
of communicating with people from all over the country!  Sure, it's a <br>
primitive, slow-paced form of communication... but what a romantic <br>
and magical way to communicate!  As I sat there on the trail looking <br>
at all the messages that had been left in my Marshall Lookout logbook <br>
over the past four years, I was absolutely amazed at how many lives <br>
had been touched by my simple act of hiding a little box.  There were <br>
greetings in there from all over the place!  No flames or sarcasm or <br>
messages of ill-will... just simple, friendly words from a multitude <br>
of interesting people.  Even if they left nothing more than a stamp <br>
imprint, I felt like I could tell a little bit about them by <br>
examining the image.  (As a bonus, I even found a fascinating clue in <br>
there!)<br>
<br>
I want to thank every single person who attended this event for <br>
making me feel welcome.  You all treated me like a celebrity, but I <br>
want to say that, in reality, you are all MY heroes!  You have all <br>
been working (and playing) so hard to keep the Spirit of Letterboxing <br>
alive in my absence!  Without all of you, I could not have <br>
experienced the joy of seeing how wonderful letterboxing can really <br>
be!  And when I see the love for the hobby growing in the hearts of <br>
young, enthusiastic letterboxers such as Cat's Meow, Toothfairy, <br>
Lucky Charm, and others, I realize that we've only just begun!  You <br>
are truly an inspiration to me.  I am realizing that this is <br>
something bigger than any one of us, or any group of us, can <br>
control.  Letterboxing is alive!  It has a mind of its own, and it <br>
will grow up to be whatever it wants to be.  I have a renewed faith <br>
that it will continue to be something wonderful!<br>
<br>
Thank you!  I love you all!<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Der Mad Stamper<br>
