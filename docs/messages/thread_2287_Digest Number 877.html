Mischief has placed a box not only named Mukilteo but is in Mukilteo... <br/>
VERY easy find, though not exactly considered a drive by from I-5 as you'd<br/>
have to exit to get into Mukilteo but it's only about 10 minutes from the<br/>
highway...<br/>

&gt; You're gonna be up in our new neck of the woods!  Rayvenmom just moved<br/>
&gt; up that area a few months ago.  And we don't have a clue about what's<br/>
&gt; hidden in the area yet, still settling in.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Hey Letterboxers in the Northern part of Washington,<br/>
&gt;&gt;I will be traveling this weekend to a camp 30 minutes north of Everett<br/>
&gt;&gt;and I don't the region all that well. Can someone please suggest some<br/>
&gt;&gt;relatively easy drive-bys that I can catch along the way from<br/>
&gt;&gt;Vancouver, WA. I will be located just across from Wenberg State Park.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Are there any boxes hidden there? You help will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Thank you.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Camp Fire Lady<br/>
