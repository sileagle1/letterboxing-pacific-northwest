                    <div class="plaintext-content">Besides the horrible shock of walking down the street and learning about this from the <br/>
large, front page title showing out of a sidwalk kiosk, I got to thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
And you know, I don't think it's really as big of a tragidy as my knee-jerk reaction thought <br/>
it was. Think about it. The fort was only a replica in the first place built in 1955. So the <br/>
current fort is hardly 'historic' per se. Not like the *original* fort would have been if it was <br/>
still around.<br/>
<br/>
And it's a relatively small, cheap log cabin kind of thing. A couple of dozen men threw it <br/>
up in 1805 in three weeks with tools only found from the early 1800's! Seems that, <br/>
relatively speaking, it's not a multi-million dollar building that went up in flames. It's all <br/>
replaceable!<br/>
<br/>
And now that it burned and the plan to rebuild, they can do an even more accurate job of <br/>
recreating the fort. They've learned a lot of details about the original fort that they didn't <br/>
know about in 1955 and a recreated structure could be even more historically accurate <br/>
than the one that went up in flames.<br/>
<br/>
All-in-all, it might be inconvient for school children and tourists for a bit of time, but <br/>
nothing seems to have been lost that isn't easily replaceable, and the new fort could be an <br/>
improvement! <br/>
<br/>
Silver linings are always there...  =)<br/>
<br/>
On another note, in the news article I read, it said they didn't know what started the fire <br/>
yet. I'm not an expert on fires or anything, but I'll go out on a limb and suggest it probably <br/>
wasn't due to faulty wiring. ;o)<br/>

I'm sad as a taxpayer because guess who gets to pay to rebuild it?  <br/>
You, me, and everybody else who pays income tax, sales tax, annual NPS <br/>
park pass fees, etc.  No fun having to 'pay' for some pyromaniac's <br/>
contorted 'thrills'.  The money could be better spent in other ways...<br/>

On the other hand, was it decided the fire was arson? Last I read,<br/>
they were still investigating the cause. There are fireplaces that do<br/>

The article I was reading mentioned that they'd recently rebuilt the<br/>
fireplaces to make them safer, and that they had had a fire burning for a<br/>
couple of hours earlier, but that it'd been completely doused to<br/>
extinguish it. Someone'd seen a pickup leaving the area but yeah, last I<br/>
heard they were still trying to figure it out.<br/>
