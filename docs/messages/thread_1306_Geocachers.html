                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd say the majority of the geocaching and letterboxing communities <br/>
is extremely nice &amp; respectful of what they find.  They all seem to <br/>
participate in these hobbies for very similar reasons--see something <br/>
new, experience the excitement of solving puzzles, get some exercise <br/>
that doesn't involve LCDs and opposable thumbs (meaning TVs not GPS <br/>
screens), learn a bit about the history of the region and <br/>
occasionally meet some other folks who enjoy doing the same hobby. <br/>
<br/>
Most folks who accidentally stumble upon letterboxes, though, just <br/>
have no idea what they've found and either remove it thinking it's <br/>
trash or leave it uncovered thinking that whoever dropped it will <br/>
surely return to retrieve it (at least that's been my experience to <br/>
date).  What I wonder is if occasionally folks are finding <br/>
letterboxes that have been 'nudged' out of their hiding spots by <br/>
animals/kids/weather/tsunamis/space aliens, who knows?  Most <br/>
recently I got a report that some letterboxers found one of our <br/>
letterboxes in the only trash can in the park.  Why they even <br/>
thought to look in there, I haven't a clue--but I'm thankful they <br/>
did. That move saved a letterbox in this region!!!  So, who knows <br/>
what's going on?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I hate it when space aliens nudge my boxes out of their hiding <br/>
place.  Stupid space aliens....  They should be doing something more <br/>
useful like conquering the earth... or something.<br/>
<br/>
Despite all the bad press geocachers get on the letterboxing boards, <br/>
I'll second the motion that most geocachers (as well as <br/>
letterboxers) are decent people that don't deliberately try to ruin <br/>
each other's fun.  But it's like the news: If something good and <br/>
cuddily happens, you rarely ever hear about it.  Usually you just <br/>
hear about the bad stuff--murder, mayhem, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There's thousands and thousands of geocaches out there--far more <br/>
than letterboxes, even, so when you consider the number of "clashes" <br/>
between the two hobbies, overall, it's not really a big problem.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I still don't "get" geocaching.  Seems so dull.  But to <br/>
each their own.  *shrug*<br/>

Carpe diem!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a wonderful geocacher email us about a vandalized box.  They opted to check out the clues for the other boxes and go find them.  They then emailed us to tell us which box they had put the stamp in so that we could pick it up and relocate it.  They liked the letterbox series.  <br/>
<br/>
The hobbies are different but similar and the people who are involved in one and/or both seem to be after similar goals.<br/>
<br/>
  It is the distructive individuals who "know not what they have found", see that it says "do not destroy" and destroy it for that very reason alone, are the ones we should be pointing at (pick a finger).  These are the people who see a "don't pick the flowers" sign and do it anyway :-(   They have little or no respect for anything other than their own entertainment and what they think of as fun.  Unfortunately, that is one side of human nature. We just need to ensure that each find is treated as if it is our own, and rehide them very carefully.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
On that note, we will be finding a new spot for #3 in Wild Goose Chase as it has now been vandalized 2 times in 2 different locations.  3rd time is the charm as they say.<br/>
