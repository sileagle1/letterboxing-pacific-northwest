My apologies on the missing Wapiti Box. I checked it last week and <br>
forgot to post that it was missing. The hiding place got moved and I <br>
haven't decided whether I'll replace the box a third time. As for <br>
Winking Eagle, it too has a roving hiding place. Fortunately, someone <br>
on the Grounds Crew likes this box and keeps hiding it as the <br>
landscape changes. Funhog<br>
