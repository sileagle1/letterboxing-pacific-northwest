                    <div class="plaintext-content">Had a recent report that this contender for worlds smallest <br>
letterbox (it was in a listerine breath strip pack complete with log <br>
book and 1/16" thin hand carved stamp) was missing.  Verified that <br>
indeed it has disapeared. The rare rock that it was hidden under was <br>
moved to another location and there was no sign of the tiny box.<br>
<br>
I note on the LBNA site in the clues that it is currently gone and <br>
recarve and replace soon.  Hopefully  I can find a better hiding <br>
place as this was easily found by locals.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to those few boxers who found it, those other who havent <br>
should stay tuned for updates.<br>
