Thanks to everyone who showed up at the Roadhouse for the Dec. 6<br>
Letterboxing gathering (shall we call it the Roadhouse Massacree in<br>
honor of Alice's Restaurant holiday fun? ...okay, my age is showing).<br>
<br>
The Nature Park staff will be offering a Letterboxing class sometime<br>
in Summer, 2004.  The class will include stamp carving, Letterboxing<br>
guidelines in natural areas, and a Letterbox hunt.<br>
<br>
For those of you needing a list of boxes in THPRD parks, I have a MS<br>
Word file with the Letterbox names (they are hot-linked to the LB<br>
website descriptions for each box).<br>
<br>
Have a great New Year!<br>
Kyle<br>
