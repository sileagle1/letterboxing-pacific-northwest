our house. With the acquisition of a new travel trailer we plan on <br>
being out and about the state more often now. We decided to pick a <br>

<br>
Is there a listing of which boxes are still located in/near the park? <br>
I still have the clues from FF2 a couple years ago. I haven't been in <br>
the park for about a year though. In fact I think I have a couple of <br>
HH's that can be dropped off if the HHHostel is still active there.<br>

Let me know offlist or onlist. I'm also going to get the coords on the <br>
park and see if there are any "caches" in it...yup...we do participate <br>

prefer it since they get to go do that together when we are camping <br>

I know HISS is still there.<br>
It is my box.<br>
In fact, I would like you to pull it if possible and<br>
send it back to me - I'll reimburse postage.  It's my<br>
understanding that it could use some TLC and I'm<br>
moving out of state and would like to take it with me.<br>
<br>
Would you be willing to pull it and send it back to<br>
me?<br>
