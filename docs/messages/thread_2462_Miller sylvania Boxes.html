I know HISS is still there.<br/>
It is my box.<br/>
In fact, I would like you to pull it if possible and<br/>
send it back to me - I'll reimburse postage.  It's my<br/>
understanding that it could use some TLC and I'm<br/>
moving out of state and would like to take it with me.<br/>
<br/>
Would you be willing to pull it and send it back to<br/>
me?<br/>

still up and running and don't reflect their absent status?  I've been<br/>
watching for Rise and Shine replacement, but as far as I know you<br/>
haven't done that have you?  Last I heard you had it at home, or at<br/>
least part of it.<br/>
