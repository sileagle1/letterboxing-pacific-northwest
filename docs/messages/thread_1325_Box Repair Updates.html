replacements. "Luv Ya" letterbox in Yacolt has been replaced after <br/>
being washed away by the last storm, Chelatchie Prairie Railroad has <br/>
been rehidden now that the swing bridge is over the falls, <br/>
Cinderella's log book from the Happy Postman Series has been replaced <br/>
since the last log book was so soggy that it do any good to dry it <br/>
out.<br/>
All of these boxes and more can be found and exchanges can be had by <br/>
attending the small gathering this Sunday in Battle Ground. Hope to <br/>
see you there!<br/>
