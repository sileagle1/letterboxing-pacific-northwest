<br/>
I've only been LBing for about 9 months.  I got lucky when I created my signature stamp and will be faithful to it for my LBing life!!!  I did a Spring Break trip with my best LBing buddy, Jess, and together we created "Bumble-A" and "Bumble-B" (goofy looking bees) and call ourselves the Bumbling Idiots when we LB together!!  <br/>
<br/>
I got my god-kids going on the LBing hobby and they've just created their own stamps, but they're their first attempts at carving and I'm sure they won't be their last.  You start carving and it's hard to stop!!  I have four stamps carved that I haven't had a chance to place yet.  This database in this area is gonna go shootin' to the moon!!!  Plenty to find!!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time!!  I look forward to finding some of you boxes!!  Head out to the Hood River area sometime!!  There's a growing number of boxes in some awesome spots for the hunter-at-heart!!!<br/>

Good morning Smiley. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We all certainly hope to see you there at Battleground. I am glad you were<br/>
able to navigate your way over to this list, and I am equally glad you are<br/>
enjoying this hobby so much. Last night pandora mentioned to me that you<br/>
found several of our boxes and had e-mailed her. So we thought we would keep<br/>
you in mind and see if we can't track down some of your boxes today. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I bid you well. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know I have e-mailed a few of you in the last few weeks. Reporting <br/>
on your boxes. I just placed my first boxes today! Man that was a <br/>
task. I thought I had it all together when we started out, but I had <br/>
to go back twice to get the job done right. I'm still working on the <br/>
clues to post on the LbNA site, hopefully they'll be there by <br/>
morning. Funhog just directed me to the Pacific NW group, so I <br/>
thought I'd shout out to you all.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to make it with my kids to the Passport event, but I am <br/>
also not able at this time to make definite plans, but it's on the <br/>
calendar.<br/>
<br/>
What a fun new hobby...let's see...the kids and I just started all <br/>
this Mem. Day weekend, so not even a month yet. I've gotten two of <br/>
my friends hunting too and one has stamps waiting for a place to <br/>
hide. It's been fun finding all your boxes...as I told Funhog <br/>
earlier today there are some fabulous boxes out there and it's great <br/>
that there are so many in the area. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I better get going on my clues so I can get some sleep tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone,<br/>

Subject: (OR) wow! talented new boxers!<br/>
<br/>
In the past two days, I've had the delight of tracking down some newly <br/>
planted boxes. Many thanks to Pupp and Smiley for the fun! Yowza--how can each <br/>
of them carve so much better than I do with so much less practice??? Fun <br/>
clues, great stamps--check 'em out, folks!<br/>
<br/>
I had the added pleasure of MEETING Smiley and two of her kids, as they were <br/>
surreptiously seeking one of Pupp's Lbs. I'd already found it, unaware that <br/>
these lbers were hot in pursuit behind me! I'd taken a little walk, and in <br/>
wandering back where the box was hidden, I detected in these strangers the <br/>
tell-tale signs of fellow boxers (a certain nonchalance, a clutching of certain <br/>
downloaded pages...) and couldn't help but greet them with, "I got firsties." <br/>
What a fun visit! <br/>
<br/>
Today Heather and I were recalling our concern (when we first started boxing) <br/>
that at the voracious, obsessive rate we were seeking the local boxes, we <br/>
would soon run out of ones to seek! Man, look at that Portland list now! Who <br/>
can keep up? (Besides Funhog, of course...) ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Welcome new boxers, and THANKS for planting!<br/>

<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I went to check up on my Egyptian Series in Orchards Park this <br/>
morning. I'm sad to say that box #1 &amp; #2 have gone missing. #3 &amp; <br/>
#5 are both safe and sound. When I checked up on box #4 I found a <br/>
little baggie on the trail in front of the hiding place, and was all <br/>
set to find it gone as well. It was there, but sitting out in the <br/>
open and was all moldy and gross inside, so it has been pulled for <br/>
maintenance. I will re-carve and re-hide them all soon. For now, <br/>
I've changed the clues on the letterboxing.org site, so toss out any <br/>
old ones you may have hanging around.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have box #1 &amp; #2 you may want to go back again <br/>
when I replant them. These were my very first stamps I ever carved, <br/>
and I've gotten a little better since then. I even have a few new <br/>
ones to hide...with some special treats inside. Coming soon to a <br/>
stump or rock near you soon!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are all out there having fun finding boxes!<br/>

<br/>
Hi all-<br/>
<br/>
Today a good friend of mine set off with an amazing group of folks <br/>
who are going to pedal their bikes across the US-Seattle to <br/>
Washington DC! She decided to do this for her 57th birthday, to <br/>
celebrate quitting smoking, and to rally support for those suffering <br/>
from smoking-induced lung disease (like my father).<br/>
<br/>
We waved her on this morning as she passed through Bellevue, and were <br/>
so moved by the spirit of these people that we carved a stamp right <br/>
there and then and hid it.<br/>

Subject: Our finds so far<br/>
<br/>
Hello all,<br/>
Well we have been officially bit by the letterboxing bug this year. <br/>
We have been successful at finding the Springwater trail #1 and # 2. <br/>
These were fun and very kid friendly. We just had to watch for all <br/>
the people going back and forth.<br/>
Next we figured out the Bugle Mystery Letterbox. This one was fun <br/>
because it was our first harder one that we have done. <br/>
Then one a weekend adventure we headed to Seaside where we found the <br/>
Seaside Carousel Letterbox, This one definetly took patience. We then <br/>
headed out to Cannon Beach and found the Ecola Letterbox. We also <br/>
found a geocache so that was intresting to see what that was about. <br/>
The geocache was so plain in site that we hid it a little better. <br/>
Then we headed home but even though it was getting dark we had to <br/>
stop and get the Picea Sitchensis Letterbox. We tried to get this one <br/>
last year but it was when it was missing. We had to use a flashlight <br/>
but we just couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't get it this <br/>
trip and we were rewarded with a great stamp. Right now we are in <br/>
pursuit of the Mother May I series which is very hard. We have been <br/>
successful with the first stamp so far but we are determined to get <br/>
them all. Thankfully we live just a 15 minute walk away. We are <br/>
excited about all the new letterboxes planted out in our area now. <br/>
There is so much to keep us busy. We are getting closer to wanting to <br/>
plant some of our own but just ahven't had the time to do that yet <br/>
with our 2 little babies in tow. Maybe soon we will plant some. I am <br/>
really liking carving stamps. Well happy hunting all.<br/>

Subject: Stamp question?<br/>
<br/>
When we started this hobby last year we started with a stamp we <br/>
bought. Then we learned what it took to carve one of our own then we <br/>
designed and carved a family stamp. We also carves a stamp for when <br/>
my husband and I just go out letterboxing without the kids. Then this <br/>
year the kids wanted their own stamps so I carved each of the kids a <br/>
stamp but we found that it was too time consuming to stamp in that <br/>
many stamps especially in public places.So we told them to keep those <br/>
and use then when they go letterboxing with someone else than use<br/>
(like their grandparents, who we have hooked into this hobby). So now <br/>
we are improving on our first stamp(because the baby took a bite out <br/>
it). Did others of you take some time to come up with the stamp you <br/>
wanted to use? Do you change stamps periodically? Or have you had the <br/>
same one from the start? Thanks for the input.Happy hunting.<br/>

Hi, is this the Orchards park in Aloha/Hillsboro OR (crossing my fingers <br/>
and hoping that it is! LOL) or elsewhere???<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid the letter boxing page just confused me... I know there are some <br/>
letter boxes around my area (Aloha), but can't figure out which ones they <br/>
are... I didn't see them in the Beaverton ones... and there were so many <br/>
Portland ones that I didn't have time to check them all...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter got me turned on to this sport/game? And we found a couple of <br/>
the PCC Rockcreek boxes. That was a lot of fun!<br/>

Hubbie and I got started on to letterboxing from some geocaching friends. We bought one from the store and still use it currently. I've carved 3 stamps so far but haven't really come up with our true "signature stamp." I hope to become creative enough at carving that I can create a masterpiece like many many of the ones we've seen. But until then, I just use our normal stamp.<br/>
