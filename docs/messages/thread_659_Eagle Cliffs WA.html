a long cut back home. There just happened to be Eliza B.'s fourth<br/>
letterbox hidden along the way. Having only her Cape Perpetua stamp in<br/>
my collection, this was a must-have. Although all the directions were<br/>
goofy, both driving and box hunting, I found the box. I was only the<br/>
third to stamp in since May 2002 and am amazed to see that Wild<br/>
Woman/Child were there before me. See, it IS possible to beat the Hog.<br/>

Your comment has so delighted Wild Child (who is incredulous whenever we <br/>
discover ANY box before Funhog--including those we found in Ohio and Canada)!<br/>
<br/>
Oooh, isn't the Lava Canyon Trail great, Funhog?  Y'know, when you were a <br/>
Eagle Cliffs you weren't that far from my Ap* Cav* box--and TreeMan's Where Were <br/>
You When the Mountain Blew LB, while not exactly nearby, is in the general <br/>
area.  Next time!<br/>
