                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good news, fellow boxers! I just got on my PR hat and gave a call to<br/>
to the Ranger, Mike Shannon, at the Banks Vernonia Trail SP. Since so<br/>
many letterboxes had gone missing out there, several of us surmised<br/>
that the staff had pulled them. Well, it seems we were dead wrong.<br/>
They do not feel friendly towards geocaches but are perfectly OK with<br/>
our treasures.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of caveats that Mike wanted to make. First, he<br/>
wants us to let him know when we place boxes so he can give them a<br/>
check. He'd be looking at all the usual environmental and safety<br/>
things. He wants to stress that the trail is pretty narrow and it's<br/>
easy to stray onto private property. The park closes at dusk was<br/>
another of his points.<br/>
<br/>
So, this is open territory... miles and miles of trail with almost no<br/>
boxes along them. Perhaps, Brett will feel inclined to replace his<br/>
series out there, too. To contact Mike Shannon, call 503.324.0606 He<br/>
was very nice and really wants to have things work for us. No more<br/>
Mean Mikey... Now it's Mellow Mikey! Funhog<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great news and thanks to Funhog. I'll have to talk to Mike. Note <br/>
that Hares Canyon State Park, Oregon's first new full service state <br/>
park in 30 years, is being built right now and the B-V trail goes <br/>
right through it. Also the trail will be extended from Vernonia to <br/>
Scappose too. Lots of new ground!<br/>
