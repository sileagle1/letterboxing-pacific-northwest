                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too went out letterboxing today.  We found that the perfect time to do the Oregon Zoo series is just before the Zoo Lights.  We got there at 3:30, found two of the boxes, the third one seems to have been removed.. an electrical cord ran right through a depression just the right size for a letterbox. Then we had dinner in the cafe and by the time we came out the Zoo Lights were on and we could enjoy the beautiful lights. The joy of getting there at 3:30 is, there's not another soul around.. it's too early for the Zoo Lights and to late for the casual zoo goers.  <br>
<br>
Happy Hunting all!<br>

*laughing*  Yeah, well, what can I say?  I have trouble making a <br>
simple, easy-to-get letterbox.  It's not in my blood!  I figure if I <br>
have to work to hide them, then others need to work to find them!  =)<br>
<br>
Thanks for the update on Where's Jack.  It's been awhile since I <br>
heard about that box!<br>
