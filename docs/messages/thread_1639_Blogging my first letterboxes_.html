<br>
I normally don't do this sort of thing, but hey, I got a kick out of reading<br>
your adventures.... so... I think the stamp you attempted to draw would make<br>
a really cool signature stamp.  I'm rather found of totems considering my<br>
Husband has a very serious Native American background, even if your's is a<br>
little unorthodox.  So I tell you what... if you are planning a trip to<br>
Portland anytime soon or plan on attending the letterboxing event in Olympia<br>
next month drop me a line at hispandora at phlsystems.com and I'd be more<br>
than happy to carve that stamp for you if you like, until a time that you<br>
want to re-carve it yourself :)<br>
<br>
Just and offer, no obligation, just a kind thought from one letter boxer to<br>
another who likes to see people with the signature stamp they want. I know<br>
my first signature stamp was carved for me by someone else and it was months<br>
before I carved one on my own, but I still have the original that I pull out<br>
once in a while for very special occasions.<br>
<br>
Take care and have fun boxing!<br>
