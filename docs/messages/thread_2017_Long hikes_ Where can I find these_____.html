Hello again!<br>
<br>
I have these friends who are really into being outdoors. Camping,<br>
hiking, and all that stuff. I want to take them letterboxing, but I<br>
want to make an entire day's hike of it. <br>
<br>
Are there any recomendations anyone can make for letterboxes at the<br>
end of at least an hour hike? Or maybe a series? This will be their<br>
first letterboxing experience, so I want to make sure they won't be<br>
disappointed! <br>
<br>
I live in Portland and they live in Molalla, OR (near Oregon City).<br>
Places closer to them would be better. Clues that don't take two weeks<br>
to figure out would be good too. (Cryptograms, anagrams, and all those<br>
other word puzzles I am still working on.)<br>
<br>
Thanks! I am loving this letterboxing thing.<br>
Becca (and Ryan)<br>

You could check out our Paradise Lodge two box series on the Rogue <br>
River. I think that you could call this a long hike. <br>

There are no shortage of long hikes with letterboxes in the gorge. If <br>
you do just a little homework, you can even combine several boxes into <br>
loop hikes.<br>
