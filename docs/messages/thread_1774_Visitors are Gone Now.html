Well, we had a terrific (if a little chilly) afternoon over by the<br/>
airport meeting the East Coast visitors and lots of local 'boxers too!<br/>
It was great to meet Cherokee Newman and the guys. The Nail Head (and<br/>
better half), Charlie Trailduster, dvn2rckr, BigDog2, Green Tortuga<br/>
and the Celts were also in attendance  (Did I miss anybody??). We<br/>
missed Hoopoe or were you the mysterious one in the shadows!!?? <br/>

The "Say No Evil" Letterbox will be hidden permanently and clues will<br/>
be forthcoming. I don't intend to keep it on the back of my car<br/>
forever :-)<br/>

Big Dog 2, Cat and Jolt of Team Cooties had a fun and chilly time as <br/>
well.  It is always nice to get together with others that share this <br/>
crazy obsession.<br/>
<br/>
What?  You mean that this box won't be a *Traveling Letterbox*, <br/>
Amanda?  That would make it extremely challenging indeed!<br/>
