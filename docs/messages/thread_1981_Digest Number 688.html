"After the Story's End" is currently out of order, waiting for me to <br>
rewrite the clues, and decide whether to keep the original starting <br>
place, which is a nice place, but it would be a much further walk now <br>
to the destination.<br>
<br>
If anyone really wants it that badly, you're welcome to come to my <br>
house, but it's not that great of a stamp ;)<br>
<br>
If you need anything while in the Seattle area, like advice on kid <br>
friendly restaurants or local information of some kind, please do email <br>
me - we live in the Ballard area of North Seattle.<br>
