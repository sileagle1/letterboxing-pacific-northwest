Hey you guys, I just got one of those Contact the Placer emails and I<br/>
want to whine about it but I can't do it on my own regional list in<br/>
case the sender belongs/reads the list.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the message I received:<br/>
This is confusing. AT the elementary school is the letterbox? It<br/>
sounds like it's on the grounds of bldg. 50. Could you explain? <br/>
This message is sent in regards to this page:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=12475&amp;boxname=Haunted_Central_Elementary_School<br/>
<br/>
So exactly which part of what I wrote for this box do YOU guys think<br/>
is confusing and unclear? (Completely unlike the coherent and<br/>
well-written email this person sent, right?) LOL<br/>
<br/>
Ok ... all kidding and whining aside, I'd like to ask for some real<br/>
help now please.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have normal level of ability in the "people skills"<br/>
department but I'm completely stumped on how to answer this email<br/>
without being sarcastic or offending the sender. Right now I'm<br/>
considering just sending a note that says, please review the posting<br/>
again and I'm confident that you'll come up with the solution you<br/>
seek. (Even though I'm not at all sure of that .. given what I'm<br/>
thinking of their problem solving skills at the moment.)<br/>
<br/>
How do you guys deal with these sorts of messages when they come in?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me vent and for any insight.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Hi,<br/>
I decided to stop lurking on this list and jump in with my point of <br/>
view. Since you are probably dealing with a new letterboxer that could <br/>
end up with your letterbox in their hands I would be as helpful as <br/>
possible. Even to the point of drawing a line to the letterbox with a <br/>
bright yellow crayon. I would help them get the letterbox , stamp in <br/>
and hopefully they will rehide the box properly. Any answer back that <br/>
seems to indicate that they may not have both oars in the water might <br/>
not keep your letterbox safe for the next finder. Now is the box in <br/>
the elementary school in the vice principle's office under Mrs. <br/>
Cratchits desk?<br/>

I also got one I wasn't too happy about recently.  Here's part of it:<br/>
<br/>
"We asked the groundskeeper if there were any structures in the park bearing<br/>
the number "347", but there were not (by coincidence, the clock at Miller<br/>
Park at that exact moment displayed the time was 3:47).  We then called<br/>
Irish Fest headquarters to inquire if they might give us a clue, but they<br/>
had never heard of the letterbox."<br/>
<br/>
In my response, I tried to politely suggest that they should not be<br/>
contacting "authorities" about boxes as it may put the boxes at risk.<br/>
(Arrrghhh!  Do I really need to put something like this at the bottom, or<br/>
TOP, of all my clues?)  By the way, the box was in a public parkway area,<br/>
not private grounds or in any type of historical or sensitive area.  The<br/>
clues required research on some Irish groups/events in the area, but the box<br/>
is probably 6-7 miles away from the Irish Fest location.<br/>

We got one a while back that was posted on part of our Seal Beach Town <br/>
Tour. These are very urban letterboxes, and for those that have urban <br/>
letterboxes you know how hard it is to find a good hiding spot. Many <br/>
times it is difficult for 2 letterboxers to remain stealthy.<br/>
<br/>
"Our Girl Scout troup had a wonderful time with your series. We had a <br/>
small problem at your last box though as one of the 12 girls <br/>
apparantly lost the stamp , but we put the box back anyway."<br/>
<br/>
I walked 1/2 block to the location and found the trampled stamp in <br/>
front of a bus bench near to the letterbox location.<br/>

Yes, another classic!!!  I've received so many 'interesting' comments <br/>
like these over the past couple of years it almost drove me to request <br/>
blood pressure meds...  ;)<br/>

I understand how frustrating such messages can be, but you've got to <br/>
admit that ANY correspondence is better than NO correspondence.<br/>
<br/>
I would rather have someone tell me that they misplaced a stamp than <br/>
to have them just ignore the situation.  At least then I have a <br/>
chance to go out and see if I can find it somewhere trampled <br/>
underfoot.<br/>
<br/>
And I would rather have someone contact me and ask for help than get <br/>
discouraged and develop a resentment against letterboxing, in general.<br/>
<br/>
Any time someone contacts you, it is an opportunity to show them that <br/>
you care about other letterboxers... unless you really DON'T care (in <br/>
which case I hope your letterboxes wash away into the ocean).<br/>
<br/>
I hate to admit this publicly, but I almost always provide hints to <br/>
people who contact me and ask for help.  Of course, in some cases, <br/>
my "hints" are more elusive than the original printed clues!<br/>
<br/>
I do not place letterboxes out of spite and orneriness, although I <br/>
know many people who have hunted for my boxes will beg to differ.  I <br/>
place them because I want to share a special place or experience with <br/>
other people.<br/>
<br/>
In this modern age, people are so reluctant to communicate with each <br/>
other in a pleasant way.  If someone takes the time to ask me a <br/>
question... and they are halfway nice about it... then I will take <br/>
the time to answer their question if it's at all humanly possible for <br/>
me to do so.  Even if their question has convinced me that they have <br/>
the IQ of a moldy peanut, I think it deserves an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxers are more important than letterboxes.<br/>

Thanks everyone, I appreciate the chance to whine. It helps to know<br/>
I'm not the only one with seekers who have the IQ of a moldy peanut.<br/>
<br/>
Wise and wonderful advise, DMS.  I agree with you that boxers are more<br/>
important than boxes, which is why I had planned to send a reply back<br/>
to the one who asked for help. I just wasn't sure exactly how to word<br/>
it without sounding offensive or sarcastic.  Like Baby Bear in the<br/>
Goldilocks story, I think the reply I sent was "just right" <br/>
