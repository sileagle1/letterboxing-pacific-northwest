for John and me.  I'm glad I got to meet so many people who have gotten<br>
involved in the sport within the past year.  I see their stamps and now<br>
I see their faces!<br>
<br>
It was great having Rangers Kyle and Elisa there!  I'm going to try to<br>
get together with Elisa soon.  She says they have a box of many of my<br>
Rick's Farm series there, still.  Perhaps with their informed guidance I<br>
can replace some or all of these letterboxes in the Nature Park again!<br>
And maybe those who are interested can get together and we can do some<br>
trail maintenance for the park sometime in the future (like in the<br>
spring or something).  It was great that they are wanting to reach out<br>
to our letterboxing community and get us involved in a way that works<br>
well for the park system and letterboxers alike.<br>
<br>
Great job to Funhog for getting this together.  What a huge hit this one<br>
was!  The idea of our signature stamps on the name tags was perfect!<br>
This was just the type of winter gathering I was looking forward to.<br>
Ryan and the beautiful Amanda from Seattle did arrive fashionably late,<br>
but at least we got to see and visit with them briefly.  I would have<br>
like to have hung around longer and BS'd more when we had to move<br>
downstairs, but a certain gorgeous man of mine was ready to go.<br>
<br>
All the great folks involved in this sport make me eager to go out and<br>
seek their letterboxes.  For sure Pandora and Team Chaos are must haves,<br>
though with their clues I'm afraid I may actually have to put my brain<br>
to use.  DANG!!!  Come on, guys!  I'm not that smart.  I like the easy<br>
gimme type clues.  But I just might make and effort for those stamps.<br>
<br>
Willow, Daisy, Heartsey, Campfire Lady, Cat's Meow, Bookworm, Sleepy<br>
Whippet, Wingnut...who am I missing...YIKES!  It was great to meet you<br>
for the first time, too and I will have to go out and seek any boxes<br>
that you have placed.  You are a delightful and creative bunch FOR SURE!  <br>
<br>
Great event stamp carvings by Brett!  It was terrific seeing you, Penny,<br>
Grace and the ever-adorable new sweet pea, Nicholas!  I was so glad to<br>
see you!  <br>
<br>
Mark and Beth you have got to place more LB's.  Your carving skills are<br>
outstanding!  That new Halloween series you placed is an all time<br>
favorite!  Great clues, great stamps.  WE WANT MORE!!!  It was great to<br>
see you last night.<br>
<br>
Windairen and Wizbang came to this event in such a way that I was afraid<br>
it was a black tie affair (OK...not really.  Except for what John would<br>
call the "dress Tivas" you were dolled up to the nines)  I've never<br>
cared much for Salem, but maybe a day trip is in order to nab some of<br>
your letterboxes at the college.  I know you are a young lady and a<br>
young man, but I think of you like kids and you are adorable!  And I do<br>
have a stamp or two of yours in my logbook.<br>
<br>
Even though I didn't get to talk with her (I was yakking too much at the<br>
ranger about my old yanked boxes) it was great to see A. Rose there!<br>
Glad you could make it Annette!!! <br>
<br>
My buddy, Carie of Lennens 3 convinced me this event would certainly be<br>
wonderful and, of course, she was right!  She's  great at encouraging my<br>
letterboxing soul!!!  <br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone!  What a great time.  I really enjoyed myself.<br>
Thanks to the mystery person who bought the first round.  So kind and<br>
generous.  If I'm forgetting anyone, please feel free to flog me for my<br>
faulty short-term memory.  I did grow up in the 70's you know...HA! HA!<br>
Thanks for a grand time.  I look forward to a Summer event!  Thank<br>
you!!!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
