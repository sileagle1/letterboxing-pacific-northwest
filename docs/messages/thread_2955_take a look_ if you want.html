<br>
The lady who is writing an article for the Oregonian about letterboxing<br>
was interested in the aspect of my being a Stay At Home Dad, and asked<br>
me to write a guest blog for her site about baby bonding. After much<br>
editing and re-writing, it got posted this morning. If you want, check<br>
it out at: Musings of a Happy SAHD<br>
<http://babybondingbookfordads.blogspot.com/2009/10/musings-of-happy-sah\<br>
d.html> . While it's not about letterboxing (although it does give a<br>
link to my letterboxing blog), I thought it turned out pretty good, and<br>
wanted to share it with you all.<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting,<br>
HS<br>
