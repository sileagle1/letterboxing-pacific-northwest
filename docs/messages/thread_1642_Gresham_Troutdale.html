tomorrow to drop off a few things to my previous<br>
worksite.  Hoping to hit a few boxes there since I<br>
have to be out that way.  Anyone game and want to<br>
join?  I know it's a work day....but you never<br>
know...working from home is popular these days.  <br>
<br>
I hear Oxbow park has a few and there are two others<br>
in the Troutdale area.  I've grabbed most of the<br>
Gresham one's but they are stamped in my old logbook<br>
and I wouldn't mind stamping them into the new one.<br>
<br>
Again, if anyone out there has some free time and<br>
wants to hit the Gresham/Troutdale LB's....give me a<br>
shout.  I have to be out there BEFORE 3:30....<br>
<br>
LILY<br>
