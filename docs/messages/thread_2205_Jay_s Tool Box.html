                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tonight we checked up on Jay's Tool Box and found *19* stamps! He was so<br>
excited and spent 3 hours going through the log books and checking out all<br>
the new additions. Thank you all so much for contributing to this fun box.<br>
Jay loves seeing who has been there and what they've thought up to put in<br>
it. If you haven't visited this box, please do! It's worth the trip to<br>
Gresham. If you have, but not lately, it's DEFINITELY worth going back. If<br>
you visited before but didn't add a tool, there's still time :) <br>
 <br>
 Just out of curiosity, those of you in the Portland area, what is your most<br>
visited box and how many visitors a year does it get?<br>
