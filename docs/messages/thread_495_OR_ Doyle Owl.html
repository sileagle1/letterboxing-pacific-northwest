patiently waiting for visitors. The clue, however, has changed as has<br>
the trail. What rings of time? ...and that pesky disappearing bench.<br>
It's gone again. <br>
<br>
Being in the neighborhood, I made a quick visit to Crystal Springs to<br>
check on my box there. Serenaded by baby wood ducks, I read the log<br>
book and found that a friendly gardener has made several entries over<br>
the months. The lid to the box is gone but all the contents are doing<br>
just fine. Funhog<br>
