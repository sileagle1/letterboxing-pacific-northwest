Can't wait to see you at the next gathering, adorned with raindrops<br/>
and slugs. <br/>
<br/>
Wortman's Favorite Animal is back in place and ready for visitors. I<br/>
have a new and exciting box to plant but I don't know if I can get it<br/>
out there before Sunday. Knowing that you'll be here, I'm tempted to<br/>
try but I think it will have to wait until after Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Let me just say, We Are Not Alone.<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas, everyone.<br/>
