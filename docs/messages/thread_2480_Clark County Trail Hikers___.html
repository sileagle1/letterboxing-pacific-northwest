TeaTat95 - who is in fifth grade this year - has an<br>
exit project she is working on.  The focus her teacher<br>
has given is "Trails in Clark County.  Why do we need<br>
more of them?"<br>
<br>
Well, since there are 20 kids in class and they are<br>
all focusing on the same thing, TeaTat95 thought she'd<br>
give the project a spin by focusing hers on LBing on<br>
Clark County Trails and tying that into why more<br>
trails are needed; how they should be marked for ease<br>
of navigation; and how they could be maintained.<br>
<br>
So, the request is this:<br>
<br>
Do you have a picture(s) that you are willing to<br>
email/attach that we can print out and can be used on<br>
her presentation board?  The important piece is that<br>
the picture include a person(s) LBing, and shows the<br>
trail that you are on.  We'd need the trail identified<br>
OR if you feel that would jeopardize the box then we<br>
can use a different trail name.  Also, if your picture<br>
is on a trail OUTSIDE of Clark County but you'd still<br>
be willing to share it, please do.  No one said that<br>
it HAS to be here in the county.  The goal is WHY we<br>
need more trails!!! SMILE!<br>
<br>
<br>
So, can you help?<br>
<br>
I'm coming to this great LBing community for help!<br>
<br>
THANKS!!!!<br>
<br>
