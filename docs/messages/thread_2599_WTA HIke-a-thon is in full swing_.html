I have been out on several hikes already, combining letterboxing with <br>
hike-a-thon hiking. I am hoping to beat my mileage of last year. I am <br>
shooting for at least 40 miles (just over a mile a day). <br>
<br>
And I already have more pledges than I did last year! And that is <br>
mainly because of my Flight Attendant and Pilot friends at USAirways. <br>
They have really come through for me this year. I am hoping to get <br>
some more pledges from Letterboxers too. We all use the trails and if <br>
you can't get out and donate your time for trail maintenance, the <br>
next best thing is to support your trails with a little cash <br>
donation! <br>
<br>
I have started a blog with all my trail adventures and so everyone <br>
can read about my pledges and mileage totals.<br>

<br>
A pledge of $35 gets you membership in the Washington Trails <br>
Association and you get a years subscription to the WTA Magazine (10 <br>
issues) And a pledge of $10 or more recieves a movie from my <br>
collection that was filmed in Washington State (unfortunately most of <br>
the DVD's are already gone, some VHS are left) Check out the blog for <br>
the latest updates on what is available. Every little bit helps from <br>
$3.50 to $50! <br>
<br>
If you would like to contribute, just email me!<br>
Thanks so much,<br>
