<br/>
I have taken July 1st and 2nd off of work. I live in Portland (about<br/>
an hour and a half from the gathering?). <br/>
<br/>
I would like to drive up on Friday morning, leaving around 8 or 9am,<br/>
and find some of the boxes that are already there! Then, I was<br/>
thinking that I could stay until 8pm, and drive to Eugene to stay with<br/>
my parents (another hour and a half I presume). (Unless there is<br/>
camping avaliable around the area!) <br/>
<br/>
I will then go back the next morning (with my mom too!) to join in<br/>
with the festivities and look for new boxes placed for the event. I<br/>
will stay all day. On Saturday evening I will drive back to Portland<br/>
around 8pm again.<br/>
<br/>
What my real question is- would anyone like a ride any leg of my trip?<br/>
I will be driving by myself for most of it, so I was thinking it would<br/>
be nice to with someone else who may be by themselves. You may even be<br/>
able to stay with me at my parent's house in Eugene, presuming that<br/>
there is no camping avaliable. (If so, then we could camp together too!)<br/>
<br/>
So, any takers? I know it is still two weeks away, but I am starting<br/>
to get excited for it!<br/>
