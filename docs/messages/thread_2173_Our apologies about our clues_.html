A couple of people have recently contacted us regarding our first and <br/>
only letterbox. Apparently when Ronnie typed up the clues he put the <br/>
wrong city in. I didnt proof read his notes when I copied and pasted to <br/>
the form on letterboxing.org . For anyone who cares to look for our <br/>
letterbox, it is located in Vancouver, WA, and not Redmond, OR. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the confusion :)<br/>

(we already know she is, don't we?) or Winnie and Ronnie meant that the box<br/>
is in Redmond, OR, but the clues are posted under Vancouver.  ????<br/>
<br/>
I've been here (Vancouver) for 47 years and from the clues I can't figure<br/>
out where that park is!!<br/>
Quite the hide!  Can't wait to see that stamp!  . . . if we find it<br/>
{chuckle}.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hiding, folks!<br/>
