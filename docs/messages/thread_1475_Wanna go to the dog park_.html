WE DO ! and we did! <br>
<br>
And my pups were so disappointed that they didn't get firsties! Loved <br>
the stamp. Although it looked more like a WHIPPET than a LABRADOR. <br>
And, rumor has it, Labradors are better at letterboxing than <br>
Whippets. Or so I hear :)~~~<br>
<br>
(of course, Labradors are AWFUL at fishing! They don't understand why <br>
they can't fetch whatever you throw into the water!)<br>
<br>
Thanks bookworm for a great doggie letterboxing event. <br>
