Yep, Korea & China still don't 'want' you to flush your used TP.  <br>
It's always gross to have to sit next to the 'wastebin' while you're <br>
squatting over the 'squat pot'.  I know, I know--Too Much Info!  ;)<br>
<br>
Back to letterboxing we are,<br>

P.S.  Oh, one more thing... Squeamish types, stop reading now.  <br>
Along the same lines, for anybody actually reading our blog from <br>
these past few months ( www.dvn2rckr.blogspot.com ) trkr actually <br>
pushed the 'etiquette' button on the little grey box mounted on the <br>
toilet stall walls adjacent the TP (if they even had TP mounts) <br>
earlier today.  We weren't quite sure what the 'etiquette' box would <br>
do--it had a red light on it so we wondered if it was an alert for <br>
EMS assistance and we weren't too willing to test it out for fear <br>
the 'authorities' might really show up!  Well, he pushed it earlier <br>
today in Seoul and it played a recording of flushing toilets.  We <br>
weren't sure if it was to help 'encourage' folks to go (nothing like <br>
the sound of rushing water to 'start' the process) or if its purpose <br>
was to drown out other sounds that likely would occur in water <br>
closets...  <br>
<br>
Traveling through foreign countries always seems to introduce you to <br>
some interesting things along the way... <br>
<br>
The oddest thing was, though, I lived in Korea for 16 months several <br>
years ago and NEVER saw an 'etiquette box' before.  This is <br>
something new--even though the boxes look like 1955 technology!  <br>
Maybe we'll see them in the US someday soon...  ;)  Now, I'm back to <br>
