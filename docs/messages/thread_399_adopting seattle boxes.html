Lincoln Park boxes that are "abandoned" by the muddlepuddle <br/>
trotters. I have tried to contact them about the one box that is <br/>
damaged and there has been no answer. I also put in to adopt the <br/>
MeeKwaMooks box and the Fragrance Lake box. (I chose the west <br/>
seattle boxes since I live over here and Fragrance Lake because it <br/>
is close to my Fragrance lake Perfume box)<br/>
<br/>
This should keep these clues on the website. <br/>
Since Camp Long is already gone, I guess we can just let that one <br/>
go...unless anyone knows Kathyh?  <br/>

I have asked to have the Carkeek box transferred to us, since it's <br/>
listed as abandoned. I'm not sure who the original placer was. We live <br/>
nearby and can look after it.<br/>
