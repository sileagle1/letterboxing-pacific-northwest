<br/>
Clan Jiggs spent a few days in the Medford/Grant's Pass area this <br/>
past week and managed to get a little boxing in! We had a mixed bag <br/>
sort of result for this one, with some great stamps picked up...<br/>
<br/>
APPLEGATE REST STOP - AArrgh! Yet another victim (possibly) of <br/>
Ryan's compass headings gone wild!<br/>
<br/>
GRIFFIN - Grants Pass - Box is missing. The clues were very direct <br/>
and the hiding spot had been opened and contents removed.<br/>
<br/>
CREATURES OF THE NIGHT - Merlin - WOW! What a spectacular stamp and <br/>
location! Road was okay for our car, but careful of the idiots <br/>
coming DOWN the mountain at 45 MPH!<br/>
<br/>
RUNNING FREE - Merlin - really enjoyed the trip and short hike for <br/>
this one!<br/>
<br/>
B STREET BOX - Grant's Pass - nice spot and stamp!<br/>
<br/>
RUCKMAN #1/2 - Grant's Pass - really enjoyed the walk for these two <br/>
boxes! Watch the second set of clues though! Be prepared to "think <br/>
outside the box"!<br/>
<br/>
ENDANGERED WILDLIFE - another great little stamp in the same trail <br/>
system as the Ruckmans! Took us two tries as we misread the initial <br/>
directions!<br/>
<br/>
SCHROEDER - Grants Pass - Toast. If this box was anywhere near where <br/>
the clues suggested, it would be buried under 6 or 7 feet of poison <br/>
oak, nettles and barbed creeper vines.<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it! We were hoping to ind 1 or 2 others, but, as <br/>
per usual, time was all too short!<br/>

Victim?!  Victim?!  Well, sheeze!  =)  I like to think of it as an <br/>
exclusive club for particularly determined letterboxers to have <br/>
something to complain about.  ;o)<br/>
