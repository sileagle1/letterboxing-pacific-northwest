<br/>
Details:<br/>
<br/>
- Nothing hard. I mean I wear my tennis shoes, and carry only one<br/>
water bottle with me. Nothing more than 2 miles at a time. And no<br/>
place further away from Portland than Multnomah Falls.<br/>
<br/>
- I am having trouble finding people who want to go out with me!<br/>
Especially earlyish. I was thinking about trying to leave Portland<br/>
around 8 or 9 am tommorow morning. I want to be back before it gets<br/>
too hot (like 3pm?) and I'm sure certian places will get crowded<br/>
tommorow afternoon with the holiday.<br/>
<br/>
- I was thinking about going to possibly one waterfall in the gorge<br/>
(Bridel Veil? Ponytail Falls?), a couple parks in Gresham/ Troutdale,<br/>
or Oxbow Park. Or maybe all of them, if there is time. I have<br/>
directions that take me to these places.<br/>
<br/>
So who wants to come? I'll drive, we could pick up sandwiches<br/>
someplace, and then get some fresh air outside of the city! What could<br/>
be better?<br/>
