I'm MiniBullyMom's neighbor and letterboxing buddy! She just told me <br>
about the group and said that since I have "placed" my first <br>
letterbox (in Oregon) that I need to join the list. I have been <br>
reading it vicariously via her emails! <br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy my boxes that I place. I am very busy since I have a <br>
son that is extremely disabled and he takes up alot of our family's <br>
time. So what little free time I get we power letterbox!!<br>
