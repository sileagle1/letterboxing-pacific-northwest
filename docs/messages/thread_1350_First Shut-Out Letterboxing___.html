<br/>
Toast Boy, Loud Eyes, Piper and I headed out in search of the Native Plant<br/>
series near Issaquah, Washington. There are 3 letterboxes in all. We<br/>
couldn't find a danged one of 'em.<br/>
<br/>
I think we may have walked by the first one. We didn't double back after we<br/>
figured out we'd missed it. Didn't wanna walk back down and then up again.<br/>
<br/>
But we searched quite diligently for the next two with no luck. Has anyone<br/>
visited these boxes lately? We couldn't find any land marks listed in the<br/>
clues which pinpointed the letterbox locations. Lots of trees in the area<br/>
have been blown down; so this may have made the clues harder for us than<br/>
expected.<br/>
<br/>
At least we got out on a beautiful day onto some trails we'd never have<br/>
found on our own. Thanks for that!<br/>

Camp Fire Lady and I got out today and found the Wedding Memorial box and<br/>
picked up one in the Mom, Mexico and Me series we didn't get on our last<br/>
trip through! Nice hike and a great way to start the morning.<br/>
