<br/>
I'm writing this because I feel the need to apologize<br/>
for my emails to you.  They were upsetting and out of<br/>
line.  You are correct in saying that you have<br/>
assisted me in many ways and I thank you from the<br/>
bottom of my heart for all you have done.  Your<br/>
carving class brought me to the next level.  IB's<br/>
boxing class made me think about a lot of different<br/>
techniques.  Your willingness to accept a newcomer<br/>
into the fold is admirable and your offer to have<br/>
coffee together despite how little you know about me<br/>
was a shocker.  I respect your opinion as a LBer who<br/>
has been in the hobby far longer than I have.  Your<br/>
experience and knowledge isn't to be scoffed at but it<br/>
to be revered and respected.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you will accept this apology and understand<br/>
that my intention was never to hurt your feelings but<br/>
to express what I was feeling. I've always known the<br/>
saying "The only stupid question is the one you never<br/>
ask." and then to ask the questions and be flamed by<br/>
several people was shocking and a bit disconcerting. <br/>
However, I understand why you said what you did and<br/>
have pondered it further and have taken it to heart.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You again, Pandora for being so willing to share<br/>
of yourself and knowledge about a fabulous,<br/>
intriguing, and way too much fun hobby that my entire<br/>
family (well, except hubby who remains allusive to the<br/>
coolness of LBing) has thoroughly enjoyed thus far.<br/>
<br/>
This is my last week that I can partake in the hobby<br/>
(tomorrow's my last day) before I will have to step<br/>
out of the picture and finish my education after a<br/>
long 5 years of taking classes, moving, losing credits<br/>
only to take the same classes again.  It's been a long<br/>
haul.  My daughter will also be admitted into the<br/>
hospital this week so I have had a LOT on my mind as<br/>
of late and that hasn't helped with my fingers flying<br/>
on the keyboard.  Nonetheless it's not excuse for my<br/>
behavior and for my treatment of you. <br/>
<br/>
Please accept my apology as I would like to keep you<br/>
as a LBing friend and fellow trail duster.<br/>
<br/>
LILY<br/>
aka Ruann (which is my real name)<br/>
