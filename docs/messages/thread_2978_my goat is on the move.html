                    <div class="plaintext-content">The goat mentioned in the clues to my Dry Gorge Silhouettes boxes (goat was seen in hike for box #2) has moved on.  Dept. of Fish and Wildlife say he is now in the Newberry Caldera, where (as coincidence may have it) I left a letterbox Labor Day Weekend, "Kaboom by Calli-K" and have found other letterboxes by birder and team midget hampsters as well as another I left there last year at the Big Obsidian Flow.  Do a search for boxes near La Pine, Oregon, to find the clues.  <br>
<br>
Most likely place to spot him, if you go, is on the north face of the rim.  They said he was on the upper rim but has moved down more into the caldera along the rocky slopes, which are supposedly good goat habitat.  AND he is definitely not the one funhog sited near Three Finger Jack; that one hasn't been collared, only ear-tagged.  Just some interesting goat facts for the morning news, ha ha.  The caldera area won't be open a whole lot longer as the weather will get cold and it will snow, so go now if you want to try to find the goat or just enjoy a fascinating part of Central Oregon and bag several letterboxes to boot.<br>
