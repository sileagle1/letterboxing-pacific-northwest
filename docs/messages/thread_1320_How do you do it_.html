<br>
We're relatively new to this fun.  My husband and I both have Palm<br>
Pilots, so we download clues there, and work off that.  But I have<br>
been talking about it to my friends, many of which are not the techno<br>
geeks that we are.  How do most of you keep track of clues?  Just<br>
print and bring in a backpack?  Do you get many clues ahead of time,<br>
or just the ones you're going for that day? Doesn't that get to be<br>
quite a lot of paper? <br>
<br>
Also - Anyone know anything about Lion of Lions Park, in Lacey?  We<br>
didn't have any luck there, and never heard a response from the owner<br>
of the box.  <br>

Thanks for the help!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Everyone has their own way. I like being able to stuff a little piece of paper into my <br>
pocket if someone happens along the trail. I always like to try to be inconspicuous. <br>
Generally, I only print the clues that I intend to use during the current boxing venture <br>
but there is a standing collection of ones that I want to search out that are in my <br>
backpack at all times. <br>
<br>
I do know of one letterboxing day that was saved by a Palm Pilot. The sun had set and <br>
the only available light was the eerie glow of a Palm. It was the one most necessary <br>
tool for finding that pesky Rock Creek Troll. I have also received a letterbox update <br>
directly from the site of one of my boxes in IA via wireless internet connection. Very <br>
Cool Geekiness!!!<br>
<br>
As for wasting paper, I am a recycling maniac. First, I NEVER print the clues directly <br>
from the LbNA site. I always cut and paste into a word processing app, make the font <br>
smaller, eliminate stuff I don't need and then print on the back of junk mail or other <br>
used paper. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Funhog<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">As we travel fairly regularly, we keep a binder in the car with <br>
clues to letterboxes from the state, organized by region.  We also <br>
have binders for surrounding states as we sometimes learn about <br>
trips at the last minute and don't have a whole lot of time to spend <br>
tracking down clues.<br>
<br>
For example:  we've got a WA binder--broken down mostly by counties <br>
and then a section for mysteries (unsolved--otherwise the solved <br>
ones go in their respective sections).  We've got an OR binder that <br>
is twice the size of WA's.  We also have a CA & ID binder (combined) <br>
because it only includes Northern CA.  Then we have a VA/MD/DC <br>
binder that also contains some clues for PA, NJ & NY as that's <br>
another area we get to at least once a year.  Then there's the <br>
Cincinatti binder (check out the website and you'll see it needs its <br>
own GIANT binder thanks to one Mr Franzsolo) although this isn't a <br>
place we get to very often.<br>
<br>
I thought about dumping clues to my PDA but haven't gotten around to <br>
doing it yet.<br>
<br>
As for the Lion Letterbox--if it's the one near the playground since <br>
there was another box in that park, too.  The clues are not very <br>
specific and I doubt you'll ever hear from the kid who placed the <br>
letterbox.  To avoid looking VERY SUSPICIOUS as an adult playing in <br>
a playground, we found the box buried about 1-1/2" deep in the bark <br>
beneath the slide.  As you stand beneath it (the wooden platform <br>
just before it connects with the metal of the slide) facing the side <br>
where you climb up it (back to the part of the slide where it would <br>
take you once you slid down), the box was buried on the left side <br>
almost directly beneath the joint where the wood and the metal meet <br>
(if I remember correctly).  The clues were awesome up until that <br>
part--as it wasn't very specific as to where in the bark one needed <br>
to dig.  Talk about a needle in a haystack!!!<br>
<br>
Oh, going back to clue binders.  I also keep a section in each <br>
binder with park maps, newspaper articles of local areas of interest <br>
for letterboxes I've considered placing in the region, etc.  This <br>
way, when you visit the area, you've got some 'ammo' to help come up <br>
with some interesting clues if you decide to place a last minute <br>
letterbox while you're there.  I also have an entire kit of <br>
letterbox supplies (including pre-built letterboxes minus the stamps <br>
& finished logbooks) that I carry in the car for all <br>
those 'emergencies'.  ;)<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>

Also, when I'm travelling, I'll save a bunch of the LbNA files to a <br>

to hand to kids or stuff in a pocket, but hate extra stuff when on <br>
the road.<br>

 especially in the dark and brush and etc., the largest font possible allows<br>
me to see it at a glance, rather than staring at a sheet of paper trying to<br>
read the 8 point font, making it obvious I am trying to read something.  <br>
<br>
On the back of the sheet of 8-1/2 x 11 paper I put a map.  Many places have<br>
online maps of the park or the area or the city.  Using the clues I can<br>
track where it likely is, saving time and confusion while searching.  (also<br>
helps when I get lost :-)  If not a site specific map, an area map to get to<br>
the starting point.<br>
<br>
I fold the paper so I am looking at the specific clues I am following, so it<br>
is not an 8-1/2 x 11 sheet, but a 2-3/4 x 8-1/2 sheet, which can quickly<br>
slide into a pocket when necessary.<br>

For the low price of a couple of cases of printer paper, you, too, <br>
can save a tree.  It just might be that very tree by which you hide <br>
your next letterbox...  ;)<br>
