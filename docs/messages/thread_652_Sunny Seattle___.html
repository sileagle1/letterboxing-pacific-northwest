Dvn2r, your neighbor bothers to water his lawn?  I<br/>
guess you're lucky enough to live in one of the few<br/>
areas where the ground dries up enough to grow grass<br/>
rather than cattails.<br/>
<br/>
No, California has a much more pleasant climate, and<br/>
as bburk indicates, you can always drive up during the<br/>
couple of weeks of tolerable weather and leave your<br/>
money at the tourist traps before the rain comes back.<br/>
