Come to think of it, it rained all night long--I awoke to dew on the <br>
grass--or was it just my green-grass obsessive neighbor who waters <br>
his lawn 24 hours a day?<br>

Dvn2r, your neighbor bothers to water his lawn?  I<br>
guess you're lucky enough to live in one of the few<br>
areas where the ground dries up enough to grow grass<br>
rather than cattails.<br>
<br>
No, California has a much more pleasant climate, and<br>
as bburk indicates, you can always drive up during the<br>
couple of weeks of tolerable weather and leave your<br>
money at the tourist traps before the rain comes back.<br>
