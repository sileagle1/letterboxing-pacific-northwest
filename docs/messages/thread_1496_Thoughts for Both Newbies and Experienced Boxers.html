                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was perusing the new box list on the national site.  One box name <br>
was particularly interesting to me, however I don't think I'll be in <br>
Michigan anytime soon, but that's not my point.  In the clues to <br>
this box, the placer (Bindle Babe) wrote the following message.  I <br>
think it is worthy of sharing on this list, and may serve as a <br>
reminder to all of us, new and old.  <br>
<br>
ATTENTION NEW, OR BEGINNING LETTERBOXERS:<br>
If you you are new to this activity because of the article in Time <br>
magazine, or have come to it in some other way please read this <br>
first.<br>
<br>
New participants are always welcome, but before you begin searching <br>
for letterboxes, please take a moment to consider this  think of <br>
the effort that goes into carving a stamp, maybe even hand making a <br>
logbook, and then to find a secure spot to hide the box in the <br>
vicinity of a certain area or site. All of that effort spent for no <br>
other reason that to bring some enjoyment into the world.<br>
<br>
Be aware of your surroundings; enjoy the view from where you are. <br>
Letterboxes are often place in areas for a certain reason, spend a <br>
moment to consider why the placer may have chosen to share this area <br>
with others, by drawing them here with the lure of a letterbox find.<br>
<br>
Survey the area for people who may be watching what you're doing. <br>
Remember, a common activity is "people watching"... someone may be <br>
watching you! Please don't give away the hiding spot to others who <br>
might not share the appreciation of this activity. If you will use <br>
care when you replace the box in it's hiding space, you can be sure <br>
you won't contribute to a box being lost, stolen, or destroyed. <br>
<br>
Consider that there would be no letterboxing, if there were no boxes <br>
to find. Missing boxes not only deprive other boxers of the same <br>
sense of enjoyment you just experienced, but the person who created <br>
the box has lost all the time they spent and sadly, may someday <br>
choose to stop placing boxes.<br>
