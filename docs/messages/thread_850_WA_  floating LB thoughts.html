Not a lot to the Langley story.  I did get an email about the find, <br/>
and ended up talking to the finder on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
I make a couple comments about it on the LBNA list...<br/>

&gt; M--I'm curious, did somebody contact you from the base after they <br/>

Whats this? Recent floods in the NW? I've been away on business in <br/>
sunny CA.  Well it looks like my Railroad Bridge/Adna Tressle <br/>
Letterbox may be all the way to Aberdeen or beyond by now.  Too bad <br/>
there havent been any finder on that one yet.  Then again, I did have <br/>
it pretty well secured on that bridge.  Maybe I had better go down <br/>
that way and check on it again....<br/>
