Not a lot to the Langley story.  I did get an email about the find, <br>
and ended up talking to the finder on the phone.<br>
<br>
I make a couple comments about it on the LBNA list...<br>

Whats this? Recent floods in the NW? I've been away on business in <br>
sunny CA.  Well it looks like my Railroad Bridge/Adna Tressle <br>
Letterbox may be all the way to Aberdeen or beyond by now.  Too bad <br>
there havent been any finder on that one yet.  Then again, I did have <br>
it pretty well secured on that bridge.  Maybe I had better go down <br>
that way and check on it again....<br>

workable floating letterbox scenario. Maybe cast it on a very <br>

it'll be washed up at such and such beach and gone by the time the <br>
tide comes in? <br>
