I just had an update from family that I have just introduced to LBing in Salem. <br>
Our first box with them was your Woozy Goldfish box. Yesterday they went <br>
back to get it on their own and they said the river has risen and that it is under <br>
water now. We tucked it in really well when we were there but it may be gone <br>
with those strong currents. We'll keep you posted if the river drops and they <br>
can check it again. Sorry for the bad news.<br>
