                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings all! I am hoping that some of you will be able to stop by<br>
Saturday afternoon to meet and greet the very first graduating class<br>
from the Kelso-Longview Parks and Recreation Letterboxing class. For<br>
details please refer to Fudrick's post from 6/16/04 #3704.<br>
<br>
The venue for this event is called Wake Robin Environmental Learning<br>
Center. To get there, you go west from Longview on Ocean Beach<br>
Highway, route 4, along the Columbia River. Watch for the large Shell<br>
Station on the left. The next light is Coal Creek Road where you will<br>
go right. Two miles up the road, there is a little general store on<br>
the left. Just past the store is the Earl Reed Shelter. A short<br>
distance past the shelter, go left at the Y on Carlon Loop. As soon as<br>
you cross the bridge, Wake Robin is directly in front of you. The gate<br>
should be open for parking. <br>
<br>
Let's meet at the Earl Reed Shelter about 2 o'clock to get a map and<br>
say "Hi!" There is a trail, about 1/4 mile long, from the parking area<br>
to the shelter. The clues for the new letterboxes hidden here will be<br>
distributed about 2:30 to all comers. The class participants get first<br>
dibs. Come join the fun... Funhog<br>

(no bridge closures this weekend):<br>
<br>
If you go left (west) on Industrial Way just after you cross the <br>
bridge, you can follow that road (it changes names a couple of times <br>
but just keep going straight) all the way to route 4 and go straight <br>
across 4 onto Coal Creek Road (another name change!). Follow <br>
Funhog's directions from there.<br>
