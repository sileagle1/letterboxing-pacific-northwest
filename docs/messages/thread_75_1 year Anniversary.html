<br/>
In honor of the event I counted up our stats - something I don't <br/>
ordinarily keep track of - and found we are F70P23X11.<br/>
<br/>
I think our ratio of about 1 box planted for every three found is <br/>
pretty good!<br/>
<br/>
Note to Amanda - I checked your list of your 501 finds and saw that <br/>
other than one hitchhiker you haven't found ANY of our boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Of course a lot of the Portland folks need to get out of the big <br/>
city sometime and look for our boxes. Of course we do have at least <br/>
4 boxes in Forest Park too (which have been a bit lonely). Meanwhile <br/>
we need to get into the big city to find a lot of the new ones that <br/>
have been springing up!<br/>
<br/>
One other note: to our knowledge five of our boxes have never been <br/>
found: Nehalem Bay, Alaska Souvinier, Wedding Mystery, Hummingbird <br/>
Bonus, and Chief Kno-Tah. <br/>
