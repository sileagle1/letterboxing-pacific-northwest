                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well..we took trip #5 to Pt.Defiance to find some Gnomes. This time <br>
with a strategy...we checked pace counts, coordinates at every <br>
single trail marker. It paid off with us finding Ailill but <br>
Gwendolyn still proved elusive!! We spent another hour backtracking <br>
in search of her after finding Ailill but she must of been out on a <br>
walkabout today. So, all in all, we have found three out of four <br>
Gnomes. We also stopped and checked in on the Gnome Ranger HH who <br>
hasn't moved since the middle of February. We didn't move the Ranger <br>
along today.<br>
<br>
We can report that The Forest Gnome has had several visitors! They <br>
must of stumbled upon him. Some of the visitors even visited on Leap <br>
Day..they came from Edgewood. Then twice since then (as early as the <br>
last two weeks) a entire crew of about 12 or more somehow found him <br>
and signed into the logbook. <br>
<br>
We once again attempted to find the Narrows Bridge box via clues <br>
from what our miniscule brains could remember. Got the marker count <br>
right but couldn't remember the paces and degrees. Nothing really <br>
popped out as being the right tree! But that's okay.<br>
<br>
We checked on the Fantasy box to see if it was still in it's <br>
location and sure enough it is. Didn't have time to check inside it <br>
due to travellers on the trail. Didn't want their dog to find the <br>
box and pee on it you know.<br>
<br>
All in all we checked in several boxes and found them in great <br>
shape. Thinking back we probably should of opened several of the <br>
boxes we checked on to see if there were any hitchhikers we could of <br>
helped on our way. Don't recall anyone mentioning that they <br>
deposited any at the LeapDay Event.<br>
<br>
Till another time,<br>
