I posted this on the Letterboxing USA site last night but thought it<br>
also belonged here. It is in response to a message by CSCM: <br>
<br>
I thought this just might fit in with your "Dartmoor in 2004" plans.<br>
<br>
I have been in contact with Graham Howard aka 'The Moorland Wizard' of<br>
the UK, on exchanging and planting letterboxes with us. He and his<br>
son 'Dancing Dragon' have offered to place and monitor boxes on<br>
Dartmoor on behalf of LbNA members. Since just Graham and his son are<br>
involved, the number of boxes sent to him should be limited. He has<br>
suggested that he and his son:<br>
<br>
"... can do a "placement run" and produce a map and photo set for each<br>
of the contributors and set them out on Dartmoor as a "Tribute Walk"<br>
and create and monitor a (many?) special US/LbNA walk (Our term for a<br>
set of boxes usually in a circle or figure of 8 pattern in say a 5 to<br>
8 mile walk..) ..a Dartmoor tradition...The hunters have a walk list<br>
which can be as hard or easy as you wish...Often the stamps are<br>
themed..eg Letterboxing terms...Local Heros...Book tiles..(?) You may<br>
know that Agatha Christie was a Dartmoor Lady who letterboxed & Sir<br>
Arthur Conan Doyle was another author letterboxer....and so there have<br>
been boxes of their books and characters...but the options are vast !"<br>
<br>
So what do you think, is anyone interested in exchanging boxes with<br>
Graham & his son in Dartmoor?<br>
