If you are heading along the coast in California then check out San <br/>
Francisco and San Luis Obispo areas. Two drive by boxes along I-5 in <br/>
Ca. are Wild Goose near Willows, and Tule Elk near Buttonwillow<br/>
(north of Bakersfield).<br/>

&gt;Tule Elk was there as of 9/1/2004. If you are going to Pasadena you <br/>
might want to contact Buzzard on the SoCal list for an up to date <br/>
status on those boxes.<br/>
