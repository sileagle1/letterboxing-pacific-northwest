                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just FYI, I updated Jay Jeopardy's Tool Box clues to show which tools are<br>
currently residing in it. I know several people that are coming to the<br>
gathering were planning to stop there on their way in or out, so I wanted<br>
them to know which tools were represented. (If you haven't visited this box<br>
at all, or recently, it's worth the trip!)<br>
<br>
I also updated the Instant Gratification Holiday directions. Bookworm<br>
pointed out to me that I left out a turn and my spell check changed one of<br>
the names.<br>
