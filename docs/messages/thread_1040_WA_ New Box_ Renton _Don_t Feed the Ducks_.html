<br>
I love visiting family in the PNW.  Since I've moved away I really <br>
miss my family, and also....the great seafood!  I make it a point to <br>
visit Ivar's as often as possible while I'm visiting :-).  As an <br>
excuse to visit yet another Ivars for lunch, I put together a <br>
letterbox, "Don't Feed the Ducks", to leave in Coulon Park on Lake <br>
Washington, near Renton.  What a great combination!  I'm not sure <br>
the box will stay alive long. When more kids come out to play in the <br>
summer it will probably disappear.  In the meantime, enjoy the walk!<br>
