I found the Opal Creek letterbox yesterday!  It is such a beautiful area,<br>
with its own lovely blue-green creek and plenty of old growth, just imagine<br>
how positively SHOCKED I was to discover that nobody else has been there<br>
since the box was planted over a year ago!  Everyone should visit this place<br>
at least once, so put on your hiking shoes and get on down there to Opal<br>
Creek!<br>

I've visited it once!!!  I even went with a cute looking girl.  =)<br>
<br>
But it long before I even heard about letterboxing and sadly, long <br>
before Opal Creek ever had a letterbox.  But I have visited the <br>
place before, so I'm off the hook!  *whew!*  =)<br>
