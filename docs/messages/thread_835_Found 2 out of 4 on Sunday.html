                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went out on Sunday looking for 4 different letterboxes around the <br>
Olympia area.  Our oldest son who is almost 16 decided he would join <br>
in to see what this was about.  <br>
The first one we went to was Yashiro Pagoda Letterbox but was not <br>
able to locate it.  Not sure if we just were not looking in the right <br>
place or it was gone.<br>
The second one was Hedwig's Journal.  This was a nice journey around <br>
the capitol campus a little.  Clues were easy to follow and found the <br>
letterbox in good shape.  <br>
The third one was World's Most Boring Letterbox in Lacey.  At first <br>
we had a little trouble finding anything.  The kids just kept saying <br>
the only thing they could find was trash.  They didn't think of that <br>
the "trash" was a container for the letterbox.  It was a fun surprise <br>
for them.<br>
Then the last one was out at Lake St. Clair.  I can't find where I <br>
printed out the clues for the exact name of the letterbox.  But we <br>
were not able to find this one.  We found where it should have been <br>
but nothing was under the flat rock.  We thought we might go out to <br>
this one again when the sun isn't going down and maybe we just <br>
couldn't see it.<br>
Hope everyone had a great weekend.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am so sorry to say that the Chuck's Tacklebox boxes at Lk St Clair <br>
have been pulled.  I intend to add them and 3 others that are still <br>
at a couple of other lakes in Pierce County to the 7 that currently <br>
reside at Miller's Sylvania, a park run by the State (notice the <br>
creative and indirect reference to the park so as not to draw a <br>
ranger's attention on a random web search).  This series will have 12 <br>
total boxes within that park.  Since no one had even attempted to <br>
find the St Clair boxes to my knowledge, we decided to pull them and <br>
bring them together with the rest of the series.<br>
<br>
I am glad that you are enjoying the local boxes though.  I would <br>
encourage you to seek out the boxes at another state run park called <br>
Tol mie.  These are especially fun this time of year as the trees are <br>
turning and the rains return.  Also, check out the boxes on the <br>
Chehalis Western Trail and Woodard Bay Nature Trail.  Olympia and <br>
surrounding area has lots of great boxing opportunities.  I hope that <br>
you and your family will continue in the fun.<br>
