We all certainly hope to see you there at Battleground. I am glad you were<br/>
able to navigate your way over to this list, and I am equally glad you are<br/>
enjoying this hobby so much. Last night pandora mentioned to me that you<br/>
found several of our boxes and had e-mailed her. So we thought we would keep<br/>
you in mind and see if we can't track down some of your boxes today. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I bid you well. <br/>

and I hit her Forest Fantasy Series the other day and it is absolutely<br/>
wonderful!!!  I am so impressed - the clues were creative, the stamps were<br/>
very cute - and to tell you the truth, these being your first carvings and<br/>
so well done and so cute, I just can't wait to see what you are carving and<br/>
planting for us in 6 months. Smiley you are high on my list of people to<br/>
meet, I do hope you are able to make it for Stamp Camp - or if not perhaps<br/>
we can meet up somewhere else sometime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you enjoyed the Peter Pan Series - and I am looking forward to<br/>
seeing more from you!<br/>
