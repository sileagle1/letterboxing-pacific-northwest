<br>
FYI - Wood-aug has gotten several reports that the Ritzville box is missing.  <br>
:-(   Too bad as it's a nice break spot in the trip.  Maybe he'll replace it <br>
this summer??<br>
<br>
Sorry we'll miss you as we'll be out of town the day you are in the Portland <br>
area. <br>
<br>
As far as drive-bys - Wood-aug has a <br>
drive-by (nothing special location) just out of Kennewick called Horse Heaven <br>
Hills.  If you're ready to eat when you get to The Dalles, OR there's a box called <br>
Cousin's there. It's fun place, good for kids they have real milk shakes, and the food is home-cooked <br>
style.  We like the Rooster Rock box in the gorge.  There's the ever popular Jay's Toolbox (Troutdale, OR).  I like the stamp in Monte's Suds in Kennewick (short stroll in a nice park).  Sorry that many of these are our boxes . . . it's what comes to mind.  <br>
<br>
Enjoy your trip!<br>
Kurious Jo & Wood-aug<br>

Thanks for the tips. We had almost all of those boxes pinned already, good  <br>
to know about Ritzville (sorry to hear it is probably missing) but we would <br>
hate  to waste time looking for something that isn't there. <br>
 <br>
I did have any of Amanda from Seattles boxes tagged until you recommended  <br>
Rooster Rock . . . that maybe one we could do -- we will have our 3 and 5 year  <br>
old girls with us and want them to be able to enjoy the hikes with us.<br>
 <br>
Thank you all for your input. I have noted each box mentioned and now have  <br>
about 175 boxes we will be driving by. That of course is only a fraction of the <br>
 number of boxes in the area . . . I only have 3 tagged in Portland!<br>
 <br>
We are one week away and are still thinking Monday afternoon for Portland.  <br>
We would love to meet up with you guys, if only briefly, on our way  through.<br>
 <br>
Thanks again for all your help <br>
 <br>
Hart x6<br>
