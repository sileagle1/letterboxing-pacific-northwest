<br/>
FYI - Wood-aug has gotten several reports that the Ritzville box is missing.  <br/>
:-(   Too bad as it's a nice break spot in the trip.  Maybe he'll replace it <br/>
this summer??<br/>
<br/>
Sorry we'll miss you as we'll be out of town the day you are in the Portland <br/>
area. <br/>
<br/>
As far as drive-bys - Wood-aug has a <br/>
drive-by (nothing special location) just out of Kennewick called Horse Heaven <br/>
Hills.  If you're ready to eat when you get to The Dalles, OR there's a box called <br/>
Cousin's there. It's fun place, good for kids they have real milk shakes, and the food is home-cooked <br/>
style.  We like the Rooster Rock box in the gorge.  There's the ever popular Jay's Toolbox (Troutdale, OR).  I like the stamp in Monte's Suds in Kennewick (short stroll in a nice park).  Sorry that many of these are our boxes . . . it's what comes to mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip!<br/>
Kurious Jo &amp; Wood-aug<br/>

&gt; There's an abundance of excellent boxes along I90, the trouble is you'll never <br/>
&gt; get them all. In Montana you can't go wrong looking for any of Judy's boxes.  <br/>
&gt; Don &amp; Gwen have also planted not too far off the freeway, their box "On the <br/>
&gt; Trail" will take you back to the Corp of Discovery days.  In northern Idaho <br/>
&gt; Sondog's boxes are not to be missed.  We especially like the "Mullan Road" <br/>
&gt; letterbox and it is not far off the freeway.  As far as Spokane goes, I'd head <br/>
&gt; to an area with several boxes near by.  Finch Arboretum on the west side of <br/>
town <br/>
&gt; has several by Storm Crow and 2 placed by Pied Piper, all are excellent boxes.  <br/>
&gt; The Flying Squirrel Squad has one not too far off the freeway, "The One that <br/>
Got <br/>
&gt; Away" and it is a nice walk besides.  My plant, "Riblet's Goddess", won't take <br/>
&gt; too long to get to and the view is cool.  When you get to Cheney you could <br/>
check <br/>
&gt; out the several boxes at Turnbull Wildlife Refuge.  All Excellent. There's not <br/>
&gt; alot until you get to Ritzville, there's a pretty cute drive-by by Wood Aug &amp; <br/>
&gt; Kurious Jo once you get there.  Have a great trip!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hello Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   My name is Hart x6. My family, well half of us anyway (our 18 month old <br/>
&gt;   twins will be staying with G&amp;G), will be driving out to Oregon from <br/>
&gt;   Illinois later this month.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   We have been boxing since Nov. 25th of last year, just past our F100 a <br/>
&gt;   couple weeks ago and look forward to hitting the west coast boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Figured we would join this group, at least for a time, just to listen <br/>
&gt;   in and get to know some of you (I find it more fun when we find a box <br/>
&gt;   if we have an idea as to the personality of the placer).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thanks for letting us listen in, we are looking forward to getting out <br/>
&gt;   to your neck of the woods.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hart x6<br/>

Thanks for the tips. We had almost all of those boxes pinned already, good  <br/>
to know about Ritzville (sorry to hear it is probably missing) but we would <br/>
hate  to waste time looking for something that isn't there. <br/>
<br/>
I did have any of Amanda from Seattles boxes tagged until you recommended  <br/>
Rooster Rock . . . that maybe one we could do -- we will have our 3 and 5 year  <br/>
old girls with us and want them to be able to enjoy the hikes with us.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your input. I have noted each box mentioned and now have  <br/>
about 175 boxes we will be driving by. That of course is only a fraction of the <br/>
 number of boxes in the area . . . I only have 3 tagged in Portland!<br/>
<br/>
We are one week away and are still thinking Monday afternoon for Portland.  <br/>
We would love to meet up with you guys, if only briefly, on our way  through.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your help <br/>
<br/>
