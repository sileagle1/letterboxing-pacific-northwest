I just wanted to thank everyone at the event. This was a first for my <br/>
boys and I. They had a blast! Too bad I was ill prepared, but it still <br/>
worked out great. Thanks Colls for letting us use your stamps. Thanks <br/>
Homeschool Mommy for everything. Be on the lookout for new stamps from <br/>
us. The boys are so excited about it. Thanks again-<br/>

Sounds like y'all had a lot of fun.  Wish we could have joined you but <br/>
we're currently separated by the world's largest ocean.  Hopefully, <br/>
we'll be able to meet you at future Spokane area gatherings.<br/>
