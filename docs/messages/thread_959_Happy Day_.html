<br/>
Happy LB Day.  My neice and I went out today for a day of LB'ing.  Though I <br/>
think I may need to take some courses on reading and understanding clues.  <br/>
*grinz and chuckles at myself*  We went up to the Dupont Museum after <br/>
hearing dvn2r talk about it at the SE event.  We really enjoyed it, and my <br/>
neice found the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Hey dvn2r?  What does the stamp represent?  I notice the Hudson Bay logo, <br/>
but not sure what the other part means.<br/>
<br/>
Then we found the powder works, but were unable to locate the Fort <br/>
Nisqually.  It may have something to do with the fact that we had no idea <br/>
what a rose tree looked like.  My neice had fun looking though.  *smiles*  <br/>
It was a nice walk and didn't start raining till we were back in the car.  <br/>
Had a great time.  Thanks All!<br/>
<br/>
Jessi<br/>
