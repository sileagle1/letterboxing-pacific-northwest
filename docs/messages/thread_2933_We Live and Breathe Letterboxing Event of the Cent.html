the "locals" have not registered yet but have listed themselves as <br/>
attending the event on the AQ event listing.<br/>
Please keep in mind folks that this event is not one of those where you <br/>
can just 'drop in for the afternoon'. This is a fee area and everyone <br/>
attending will need to register beforehand in order to attend. This is <br/>
not a public campground that we are holding this event at, this is an <br/>
honest to goodness CAMP. Similar to one that your child would go to <br/>
summer camp at. We will have to put a deadline on registrations, <br/>
probably a week before the event so that we can have all or your <br/>
accomadations taken care of so you can have a comfortable stay. WE  <br/>
CANNOT TAKE YOUR RESERVATION OR YOUR FEE AT THE DOOR. Alot of hard work <br/>
and planning has gone into this event and we would not want to have <br/>
anyone unhappy when they get there and find that they cannot attend. If <br/>
you are putting off registering, wait no longer. Contact Marmalade if <br/>
you have any questions and/or go to the webpage and get yourself <br/>
registered. <br/>

See you there!<br/>
