Close, Siegfried and Roy, and Oaks Bottom.  Bishops Close was closed <br>

getting late so......off we will go on Saturday again!!!!  The <br>
flutterby still has me fluttered!!!!!  AARRGGHHHHH!!!  Hey we did <br>

<br>
I'm afraid you'd be looking for Siegfried and Roy for a loooong time--I'm <br>
convinced it's missing (tho I don't think Canada Goose--the placer--has yet <br>
confirmed this).  When you're looking for Oaks Bottom this Sat, you'll also be very <br>
near Sol Stamper's "Nature Book 1" and Paisley Orca's "Bike Route."  Also not <br>
far is my "Wallace Books"--but that one will probably require you to do a <br>
little work before leaving home to puzzle out its exact location. <br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
