weekend.  Sounds like everyone had a delightful time.  It would have<br/>
been a perfect event for our grandkids to enjoy, it sounds like!  Sorry<br/>
we couldn't make it but we are glad to hear that folks Boogied out and<br/>
enjoyed themselves immensely!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

yesterday at FF2: Boogie in the park.  I just wanted to take the time to<br/>
thank everyone that attended and made the event something to remember.  It<br/>
was even better than last year!<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is dried out after the rain and hail they went through<br/>
yesterday! It just goes to show you that some letter boxers have the<br/>
devotion of the US Postal Service. Neither Rain nor sleet nor hail shall<br/>
stop them.<br/>
<br/>
Iron`Bear and I will be posting our clues soon.  <br/>
<br/>
A special thank you to Team Rayvenhaus for co-hosting such a wonderful event<br/>
- I can't wait until next year guys!<br/>
<br/>
Just as an added note, I noticed that the event got referred to by the<br/>
copyrighted name of Fright Fest and just wanted to remind everyone that this<br/>
event was not named Fright Fest, it was named FF2: Boogie in the Park -<br/>
Echos of Times Past. FF2 stands for Family Fun 2 and next year will be<br/>
Family Fun 3.  After all when you get a group 50 people together and 20 or<br/>
more of them are kids it is definitely a family affair. and guess what. they<br/>
weren't all the nail family kids, contrary to what I thought they didn't<br/>
have THAT many :) Thought the Head Nail did tell me they are cheaper by the<br/>
dozen. (laughing) <br/>
<br/>
Sorry some of you couldn't make it, we really hope to see you next year.<br/>
