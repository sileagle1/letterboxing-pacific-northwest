great time.  Maybe next time I go there I will actually score some boxes<br>
instead of sit around and B.S. with everyone!  It was such a good time.  <br>
<br>
Fudrick -- You were missed, Buddy, but you carved a wonderful event<br>
stamp to come in your stead, I must say!  <br>
<br>
Also, I was going to place a letterbox at Paradise Point State Park this<br>
weekend, but the place is not a paradise in any way, shape or form.<br>
Therefore, I decided to NOT place because it's not even worth the $5 to<br>
get into the park and my stamp wasn't good enough to warrant it.  I'll<br>
try to go to some nicer parks and place.  Places like Wake Robin.<br>
<br>
Next time Funhog teaches a class I will certainly take it if I can.  I<br>
would love to learn how to make those beautiful handmade logbooks!<br>
<br>
