Yes, my son did make it to the playground where he was supposed to wait for<br>
me, but decided to come back and find me after his back quit hurting.  It<br>
didn't surprise me that he did this, it was just the wrong place and time of<br>

I just wanted to take the time to let you know that a thank you is not at<br>
all in order.  While I appreciate the heartfelt sentiment I just want you to<br>
know that what we did, we did as a community and that I think is the<br>
beautiful thing that we all saw come forth in the final hours of the<br>
Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp. -- From the moment the hosts were<br>
informed your son was missing, we had volunteer after volunteer and someone<br>
actively working on getting him back to you safely at all time.  While I<br>
know personally that Iron`Bear, Camp Fire Lady, Maiden, Bookworm and I did<br>
this instinctually out of a love for our community and fellow boxers and<br>
because we were hosting the event and had walkie talkies and phones ready<br>
just in case a situation arose, I want to also mention how an experience<br>
like this shows the best aspect of our community, the aspect of<br>
togetherness.  Within moments of our group being informed that a child was<br>
missing, we had Der Mad Stamp and Bethany step up and hit the trails in<br>
addition to all of the hosts. We had Charlie Trail Duster back at Base Camp<br>
running a walkie talkie and keeping us all in sync.  We had several other<br>
people ready to form search parties in a moments notice, Team Garlic keeping<br>
an eye on the campfire that had been started for our next little shindig,<br>
and several others who where waiting at base camp to make sure everything<br>
had a happy ending before they left for the day.  <br>
<br>
One of the wonderful things that Iron`Bear said to me before going to bed<br>
that night, and though it sounds dramatic will be a moto of mine at any<br>
group function from this day forward, was that there was a line in a Mel<br>
Gibson movie where they were going to war and the soldiers were told that<br>
their leader would be the first person out on the battle field and the last<br>
one in. <br>
<br>
Thank you for being their Keli, and thank you for leaving us all with an<br>
experience that shows you what kind of caring and togetherness this<br>
community is capable of in time of need.<br>
<br>

You are quite welcome - however as pandora already mentioned there is no<br>
thanks necessary from you. After you told me to go ahead and return to my<br>
campsite - that you didn't want to spoil my time at the event; I told you at<br>
the very beginning of those frightening moments for you - that I wasn't<br>
going anywhere - or doing anything else until I knew your son was where he<br>
should be once again. I am sure everyone else felt the same way during that<br>
time as well. What pandora said is absolutely correct - I think it taught<br>
everyone there something that they will cherish forever more.  You mentioned<br>
that it was above and beyond the call of duty but I don't see it that way -<br>
we all were just some letterboxers that were helping out a fellow<br>
Letterboxer. I would have done the same for anyone else - as I am sure the<br>
same goes for everyone else that helped out. It was one of those times that<br>
you have attained the skills of search and rescue - hoping to never have to<br>
use them. But you are very glad to yourself that you have them when such a<br>
situation like this one arises. <br>
<br>
I personally didn't get a chance to thank properly those that did give a<br>
helping hand. So thank you all for stepping up - and being part of a<br>
wonderful community of letterboxers. Der Mad Stamper and Bethany - thank you<br>
hitting the trails south - while I went north. Charlie TrailDuster thank you<br>
for being at base camp for us- working those radios; we could not have<br>
passed the information rolling in without you. Maiden - thanks for hitting<br>
the trail with me the second time. Campfire Lady and Bookworm - what can I<br>
say you two are awesome thank you as well.  And to everyone else that was<br>
there during this time - thank you for the part that you carried out. <br>
<br>
We walked into this event with not knowing all of you. But we walked out<br>
with wonderful lasting impressions. Thank you for coming Keli - and I look<br>
forward to meeting you and your children again - and hopefully one day<br>
finding one of your boxes. <br>
<br>
I bid you well. <br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortuante as this incident was, I think it is good to note that while letterboxing is a passion, it's still a sport, a game. Everyone dropped it to help find this child: some by hiking trails in the dark, some by talking to rangers, some by going campsite to campsite to talk to people, and some by staying put and not adding to the chaos. I think that everyone was ever so diligent in watching their own children and the children in their charge at this time. It just shows how much passionate people can drop their passion to do what is right at the moment. <br>
Although, I am still laughing over the comment made by one large, bear like creature in our own camp - that if someone had just thought to plant a letterbox on the boy, the entire crowd would have found him and jumped him in seconds!<br>
