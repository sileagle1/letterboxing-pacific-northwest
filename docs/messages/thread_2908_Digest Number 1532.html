I have been checking on mine recently and can tell you that:<br/>
The Shell Game<br/>
Where Pigs Fly<br/>
Batman Returns<br/>
and Jacks are all in place as of the last week. That was 4 out of 4 I  <br/>
checked so I'm pretty happy about that!<br/>
<br/>
I will be checking soon:<br/>
Pie Rats Ahoy<br/>
A Kids Favorite Fairy<br/>
Cardinal Alert<br/>
<br/>
I know Cat &amp; Mouse is missing and plan to replace soon.<br/>

&gt; Welp, you ain't gonna like this one, but the same thing is happening<br/>
&gt; in Connecticut fer shure. Not to sound paranoid, I don't think these<br/>
&gt; folks are that organized, but here's an unhappy note we recieved<br/>
&gt; tonight at LbNA. Good luck! Jay in CT<br/>

&gt; We have gone to multiple letterboxes close around tualatin tigard and<br/>
&gt; beaverton, every one we go to, all the boxes are missing.... I think<br/>
&gt; there is a little butthead going around stealing all the boxes! Maybe<br/>
&gt; you can put up a notice or send out an email stating this so everyone<br/>
&gt; checks their planted ones....<br/>

We also found Iron Mutt, Motel 6, and one of my  boxes that I planted last<br/>
year and forgot to ever post the clues for. (They are now posted)<br/>
