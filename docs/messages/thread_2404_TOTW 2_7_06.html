question all morning - thinking about exactly the same issues you<br>
mention and also came up with no better answer than you did. <br>
Difficult question to be sure!  I personally favor the words spelled<br>
out but get the feeling I'm in the minority about that, at least you<br>
and funhog have expressed your opinions against it, and I don't feel<br>
strongly about it as you apparently do.  I will probably base my final<br>
vote on color/design rather than whether or not the words are spelled<br>
out if it comes down to that.  As to what to do with Thunderbird's<br>
patches in terms of a runoff (and I certainly hope at least one of<br>
them is in that runoff), I have absolutely no good answer to offer. <br>
Since I didn't dream up this whole poll and patch idea myself, I will<br>
defer to the person who did and be happy with whatever funhog decides.    <br>

 I would combine the two Thunderbird designs, but my vote would go for<br>
the one with just LBPNW.  When I first looked at them, I thought they<br>
were the same.  I wasn't sure which to pick of the two until later.<br>
<br>
Who'd 'ave thunk it would get a little heated to just chose a patch? <br>
If any want to contribute ideas, you can send some our way for the<br>
Rocky Mtn list.  We talked about a patch, but only one idea was<br>
actually put out there.  We need to find some people with some<br>
artistic talent.  You wouldn't think that would be hard since there<br>
are some amazing carvers in the region, but we still hit a wall.<br>

<br>
Actually, I kind of like that idea, but as a long-term project. For<br>
now, I'd stick with one patch since most places require a minimum<br>
order of either 50 or 100 patches, and either way, someone's likely to<br>
be left holding a lot of excess patches. I know the folks on the<br>
Southeast board purchased 200 of them and still have over 150 of them<br>
laying around collecting dust. <br>
<br>
So from a financial standpoint, one patch would be much perferable.<br>
Even with the minimum order, they'll likely still be some left over.<br>
With two different patches, you'll wind up with even more extras.<br>

Actually, I could probably get smaller 'batches' of patches made (since <br>
this is something we have to deal with a LOT for work) as long as we <br>
can get the concept submitted and delivered before the end of spring.  <br>
After that, you'll have to find a different source because mine will be <br>
moving on to distant shores as will we, too. <br>
