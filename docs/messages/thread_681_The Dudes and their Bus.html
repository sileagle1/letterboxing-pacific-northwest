I saw their Bus this weekend while checking out other boxes.  I had <br>
stamped into the bus at the get together so left the Feeling Groovy <br>
MicroBus for someone willing to tow it along.<br>

It is a great theme series for the HH's and really brought back a lot <br>
of silly feelings about that era.<br>
