<br>
I was curious about Ron saying he Blogged some more boxes and so went to his<br>
website. It was fun reading what he had written. I was intrigued by his<br>
comments about "Great Moments in History: June 8, 1959" so I went to check<br>
it out. I am so proud of figuring it out. What a great moment in history! My<br>
husband enjoyed the moment also :)<br>
<br>
Now if I am ever in the area where this box is hidden. I might be able to<br>
actually find it. I don't travel as much as many of you. Can't imagine 9000<br>
mile on my car over a couple of months, not even when I lived in California<br>
and commuted into LA to work!<br>
<br>
Still new to the group, but intrigued by the conversations :)<br>

Mama Jade Cat, this encyclopedia article should answer most of your questions:<br>

The rubber stamp is good, and fitting as well.<br>

Hope you can make it.  It's a pretty hike, and not very hard.<br>

I have been enlightened. If I hadn't asked I would have gone on assuming the<br>
wrong thing.<br>
<br>
And I will work on convincing my family it is worth the drive. I did see<br>
some of the pictures in your blog and know what tree not to look in :)  Also<br>
looked at some of the other stuff you blogged. My life would be very dull to<br>
blog.<br>
<br>
Wanted to letterbox today because there was no school, but my kids bagged<br>
out on me. It was raining kind of hard here. I paid them back though by<br>
dragging them shopping. They should have taken my offer to letterbox.<br>
<br>
