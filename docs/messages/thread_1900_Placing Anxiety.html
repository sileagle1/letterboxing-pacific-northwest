We are fairly new to letterboxing. We found this sport a couple of <br>
years ago but had a baby and quit for awhile. We are very hooked and <br>
look forward to every opportunity to go out hunting. Anyways, my <br>
question is I have been thinking of placing letterboxes and even <br>
scouted out areas that would be good for placing, but my concern has <br>
been how often does one have to check on your placed letterboxes? I <br>
have anxiety about them being lost.Or not being able to get to them <br>
to check on them. Like I want to place one in rememberance of my mom <br>
but it would be at the beach which we don't get to often. I am not <br>
good at tricky clues as many of you all are so I would be afraid to <br>
place them and then lose the work I have done as I have seen some of <br>
you guys lose some good stamps.Whenever we go out we take extra care <br>
to make sure we leave it better than we find it(replace bags if <br>
needed,clean up the area to make it looked less traveled, even hide <br>
it more naturally than we found it sometimes,we have found some that <br>
anyone walking along could see and I am sure that wasn't the intent <br>
of the placer if I have learned things right)So please my more <br>
experiences letterboxers any advice would be great.I really want to <br>
start placing but just dragging my feet about it. Thanks for all the <br>
help you could give me. Happy Hunting.<br>

I understand your concern about your letterboxes. They tend to become <br>
our "babies" so to speak and letting them go is somewhat stressful. <br>
Beleive me, the more you place, the easier it is to let go. I know <br>
there are a lot of letterboxers out there that feel the same way that <br>
you do and they tend to treat the letterboxes that they find like one <br>
of their own and take good care of it. They are also very good at <br>
contacting the placer and letting them know that their baby is fine <br>
and in some cases that there needs to be some repair (which they <br>
generally take care of themselves) or if it goes missing. Just make <br>
sure that the box is hidden well and that is pretty much all that you <br>
can do. Thank you for taking care of other boxes that you find. I am <br>
sure that the owners appreciate all that you have done.<br>
All I can say is, just jump right in and hide your boxes and see what <br>
happens. You will be surprised at how long some can stay hidden from <br>
view. Happy Planting!<br>

     All I can say is this on that score....  When we placed our first<br>
letterboxes, it was in a place that was very close to home, like less<br>
than 5 miles away.  We planted a series called the Snow Dogs and we<br>
checked them every day, then twice a week, then once a week, then<br>
once a couple of weeks, then once a month, then.....<br>
<br>
     One day, after they'd been there for awhile, we went to check on<br>
then, having quite some time pass since our last check. At that point<br>
we discovered that we had lost approx 40% of the boxes we planted. <br>
It was then that I decided to treat letterboxes as children and<br>
prepare them as best as I could for the real world and then send them<br>
off on their own.<br>
<br>
     Nothing will ever replace a lost/damaged/misplaced letterbox.  This<br>
is a chance you take by placing it out in the wild for others to<br>
search for.  Even sending them through the Mail to specific people<br>
does not stop them from becoming lost, as we came to learn on the ill<br>
fated Aztec Gold PLB.<br>
<br>
     Take pleasure in the crafting, take pleasure in the finding, take<br>
pleasure in the simple fact that you're outside doing something and<br>
seeing something you prolly wouldn't have seen had it not been for<br>
letterboxing and remember this one simple thought......<br>
<br>
<br>
Even if your golden rule is to do unto other's letterboxes as you'd have<br>
them do unto yours, many won't.  It's a sad and simple fact in many<br>
aspects of life and even more prevalent here in this hobby for some<br>
strange reason.<br>
<br>
<br>
     We check our boxes whenever we get a chance to. If they are there, we<br>
are overjoyed. If they are missing, then we have a moment of silence<br>
and we move on.  (I'm kidding, we just move on! (grin))  We plan the<br>
replacement, we get to search a new location, we get to research and<br>
build new clues, we find the silver lining and we embrace it.  If you<br>
worry about the what ifs, you'll never get out and plant one.  And we<br>
plant so others can find, so they'll plant so we can find, do we not?<br>
<br>
P.S.  We keep an image of every stamp we've created, in our own little<br>
stamp gallery we carry with us so we'll at least have that, if nothing<br>
else, should it go missing.<br>

You don't actually ever HAVE to check up on your boxes.  I've planted<br>
some in rather remote areas (two in Africa jump into mind in my case)<br>
that is likely to see the end of the earth before seeing me again. <br>
Such boxes I "maintain" remotely based on feedback from people who try<br>
to find the box.  If I think the box is likely missing, I'll mark it<br>
as such.<br>
<br>
As for anxiety about losing boxes--it WILL happen.  No box will last<br>
forever.  Eventually, somewhere, someday, your box will go missing.<br>
<br>
There are things you can do to help reduce the likelihood of a box<br>
going missing.  The more remote it is, the less likely it'll go<br>
missing.  The fewer people who look for it, the less likely it'll go<br>
missing.  If you can hide it indoors behind a counter somewhere, it's<br>
less likely to go missing.<br>
<br>
But in the end, there's nothing you can do to guarantee the safety of<br>
a letterbox, so try not to grow too attached to it.  Losing a box gets<br>
easier with experience as well.  =)<br>

I have been fairly fortunate to have only lost one box. I thought it <br>
was hidden well at in a crack in an enormous boulder covered in lots <br>
of smaller rocks. it was in a beautiful spot at the end of a <br>
magnificent canyon with with a river running through it, a popular <br>
rafting river, on a sandy beach where I often stop to rest on rafting <br>
and boat trips, well I didnt stop to think of the millions of other <br>
rafters that do the same thing every day of the summer and assumed it <br>
would be safe buried in a crack under rocks. I was wrong. But hey, no <br>
biggie right? it wasnt the most wonderful carving Ive done, it was a <br>
spur of the moment sitting-on-the-beach-frying-in-the-sun kind of <br>
stamp of a chinook salmon. Its ok, its all part of letterboxing, Ryan <br>
is right, the more remote of a place, the less likely it is to go <br>
missing but sometimes I like to put boxes in busy places for the less <br>
adventurous letterboxers who maybe cant hike as far as others. I keep <br>
a stamped image of all my carvings so I will always have that :o) and <br>
if I want to recreate the stamp, I have the original for a template. <br>
