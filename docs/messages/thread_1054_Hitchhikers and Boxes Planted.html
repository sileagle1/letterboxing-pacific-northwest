                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a fabulous weekend.  We sought out 5 boxes, found 3 of them. I also got three new boxes planted at Oxbow today.  It was FREEZING, but absolutely beautiful.  We did run in to several foolish fisherman, but no other hikers.  Over the course of the weekend I found two hitchhikers and managed to get them both moved.  I LOVED the stamp in the second one and the book was adorable as well.  I sincerely hope it passed your way soon.  <br>
<br>
Please let me know if and when you get a chance to find my new series at Oxbow.  I did the clues a little differently from others I've done so far and want to make sure it's doable! <br>
<br>
Also, for those that were interested, it looks like I'm going to have the Beating a Dead Horse Postal Box this Saturday, so Camp Fire Lady and I will figure out where we're going to meet up and anyone else that would like to meet us and stamp in is welcome!<br>
