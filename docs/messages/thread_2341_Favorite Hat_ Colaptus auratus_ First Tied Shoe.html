Yes, September is a very quiet time there.  Most kids are back in <br/>
school, but the weather is still good.  I've camped there in <br/>
September many times.  Mosquitoes are gone by then, too.  Any <br/>
earlier than mid-August -- lookout.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We planted our first box there when we were up there.  It's very primitive, <br/>
being spur-of-the-moment.  I hadn't planned to plant any boxes, since we had <br/>
never even hunted before that trip.  But we were so inspired by the several <br/>
great boxes we found (including yours, I believe!) that I scrounged around in <br/>
our school supplies and was able to put one together.  I imagine it's buried <br/>
under several feet of snow right now!<br/>
<br/>
I 'm hoping we can spend another week up there next Sept.  The cabins are <br/>
SO cheap during Sep/Oct.<br/>
