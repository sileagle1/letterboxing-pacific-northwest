<br/>
I went to check on "The Duel" Letterbox in Lewis County, WA the other <br/>
day and had to pull it due to long-term construction in the area.  <br/>
Because we're soon departing the area for the LONG HAUL I've decided to <br/>
retire it--at least until we return to the area in 6 years or so...<br/>
<br/>
Please pull your clues to this letterbox.  I've annotated in the clues <br/>
and all the LB clue websites (I know about) that it is retired--don't <br/>
find yourself in the same shoes as other boxers who have travelled long <br/>
distances to look for clues to a letterbox that says ***retired*** in <br/>
the name/subject/status line.  Yep, it's happened...<br/>
<br/>
Have a great April!<br/>

We did run out of daylight too soon, though, and it looked like the place where it was hidden (at least, where we thought it was hidden) had been well-prowled through by maintenance people and so forth, so I didn't have much hope that it was still even there.<br/>
<br/>
  Only a couple of weeks after that, he informed me that his company was called out to that site for concrete testing and that half the park was torn up.  Sad...  But what a small world it is...<br/>
