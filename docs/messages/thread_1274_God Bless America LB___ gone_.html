I switched out the stamps, so he got both just for fun!!!)<br/>

I would really like to replace this, just need to find a different <br/>
spot now, that was pretty much the only spot in that park to place <br/>
something, but I like having a box to honor our service..men and <br/>
women!  I will think of something soon!<br/>
