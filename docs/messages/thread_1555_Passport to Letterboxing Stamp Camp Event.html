                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to take the time to say a few words about the Passport to<br/>
Letterboxing Stamp Camp Event.<br/>
<br/>
This event was by far the most fun I've had in an extremely long time. I am<br/>
so proud of the turn out we had and I think Iron`Bear, Camp Fire Lady,<br/>
Maiden and Bookworm deserve a huge pat on the back.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to send a special thank you to Der Mad Stamper -- Mitch, whether<br/>
you realize it or not, meeting you had to be hands down, one of the most<br/>
memorable experiences I have ever had in letterboxing.  Meeting you was an<br/>
honor I will never forget. Though I heard you had an encounter with Bigfoot<br/>
and had something to show for it that I forgot to ask for - so I hope to see<br/>
you again soon!<br/>
<br/>
Team Garlic -- You are such a unique family and your kids are all so very<br/>
special. I cannot thank you enough for the kind birthday present you gave<br/>
me, the wonderful gift of your bagpipe playing and the opportunity to get to<br/>
know you guys.<br/>
<br/>
Bethany - As usual you had something to do with yet another memorable moment<br/>
in letterboxing for me.  When I saw your son passed out on the ground, sound<br/>
asleep, using a letterboxing bag as a pillow Saturday night I could not help<br/>
but think -- wow -- this is one of the moments you love the fact that<br/>
letterboxing is a family hobby, and a Kodak moment you don't want to miss!<br/>
<br/>
Team Nashoba -- I am so grateful for getting the opportunity to meet you and<br/>
have gained such and understanding of your group.  Pupp said something this<br/>
weekend that just tickled me pink -- that if she carved a stamp you could<br/>
get for cleaning her house our group would come get it! I think your right<br/>
-- so you let me know when to come do the dishes and I'll be there! And<br/>
thank you for the birthday card! It was just perfect!<br/>
<br/>
Slo Mo, Wood Splinters &amp; Ladybug -- I cannot tell you how special the three<br/>
of you made me feel. You were all so excited, so eager and so full of<br/>
compliments that you made me feel like a star when all I was really doing<br/>
was giving to you the gifts of knowledge other letterboxers and some<br/>
extraordinary carvers had given to me.  <br/>
<br/>
ISignasLily -- It was a pleasure to meet you and to be a part of introducing<br/>
you and your family to the wonderful experience of letterboxing events! You<br/>
are truly a delight and the carving you did during our carving workshop was<br/>
just awesome! I can't wait to see the stamps you will be putting out in the<br/>
future!<br/>
<br/>
KeliKana - Thank you so much for attending and for all the gracious<br/>
compliments you gave our little group of hosts. I hope to see a lot more of<br/>
you and your family in the letterboxing community and I'm excited to see<br/>
where I run across your signature stamp in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Cathy -- It was awesome to watch you as you experienced your first<br/>
letterboxing event - I can't wait to see what you end up selecting as a<br/>
trail name and the signature stamp you come up with to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
Goofy &amp; Critter -- Watching the two of you work together in the workshops<br/>
was so fun! It is always touching to me to see a mother and daughter have so<br/>
much fun together.  With my mom being in California it always makes me smile<br/>
to see mothers and daughters that have such good relationships.  And Goofy,<br/>
that book you did came out better than mind did the first 10 times I did it!<br/>
Way to go! You're the bookbinding queen!!<br/>
<br/>
Willow, Heartsy &amp; Daisy -- Thanks for coming and thanks for attending my<br/>
birthday party, nice to see you again.<br/>
<br/>
Maiden &amp; Tarnished Knight - Thank you for helping to host one of the most<br/>
fun events I have ever attended.  You bookbinding workshop was awesome and<br/>
defiantly the only way I will ever made log books again! And thank you for<br/>
bringing my Birthday Cake!<br/>
<br/>
Bookworm &amp; Seahunter - Thank you for all your help and assistance making<br/>
this event the best it could be -- and Bookworm, a special thank you to you<br/>
for rescuing my Leaf of Lorien Hitchhiker from a less that desirable fate! I<br/>
just adore you sometimes!<br/>
<br/>
Team Rayvenhaus - Having you at this event was by far one of the high<br/>
points.  I was so glad to actually get to participate in boxing with you<br/>
again. I know the last several months have been really hard on you guys and<br/>
it was so good to see you and the kids out having fun again! And Steve --<br/>
you and Iron`Bear mystify me with your ability to orchestrate such perfectly<br/>
synchronized snoring symphonies.  Next time I'll make sure your camp site is<br/>
just a little bit farther away! Or I have earplugs -- either way I can't<br/>
wait to camp with you again!<br/>
<br/>
Old Vet - every time I see you I am amazed at your enthusiasm, your sense of<br/>
humor and your ability to make all of us smile and awe -- I wish my dad<br/>
would get into letterboxing and participate in such a cool hobby with me.<br/>
Bethany is sure a lucky daughter!<br/>
<br/>
Charlie Trail Duster -- as always it was an absolute pleasure to be around<br/>
you, and an honor to share the same birthday with you. Thank you again for<br/>
the cool coffee mug - I'm a big coffee drinker and now I finally have a<br/>
coffee mug I really like and all my own so I don't have to steal Iron`Bear's<br/>
Harley Davidson ones anymore! You are such an amazing person Charlie -- even<br/>
if you lie about your age and complain about the hat they made me wear too!<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least -- Camp Fire Lady - I don't think this event would have<br/>
been half of what it was without you and it was yet again a reminder to me<br/>
how lucky I am to have such a wonderful friend.  Iron`Bear and I love you<br/>
dearly and we cannot thank you enough for putting together this wonderful<br/>
event.  The present you gave me was so absolutely perfect and beautiful that<br/>
I cannot tell you how special it will always be to me.  It will find its<br/>
permanent spot on my desk here real soon and make me think of my friend and<br/>
smile every time I get a tool out of it.<br/>
<br/>
If I missed anyone it is completely unintentional and I do apologize, with<br/>
such a busy weekend and so much going on it's hard for me to remember<br/>
everything.  Everyone that attended Passport to Letterboxing helped make the<br/>
event the spectacular event it was and I thank each and every one of you!<br/>

course, we took the 'road less travelled' on the return trip and hit <br/>
a couple of rarely visited gems of letterboxes along the way.  <br/>
<br/>
Gigantic kudos to the folks who planned Stamp Camp!!!  My kids and I <br/>
had a wonderful time and learned a bunch along the way.  Honestly, <br/>
any event that gets my father (Ole Vet) doing something artistic <br/>
(carving stamps!!!) is a resounding success just by itself!  I can <br/>
honestly say that I've NEVER seen him do anything artistic in my <br/>
entire 30+ something years!!!  I presume the last time he carved <br/>
anything would have been the 'surgery' phase of med school sometime <br/>
in the 70s.  My kids absolutely loved the event--as evidenced by the <br/>
previous comments about them falling asleep on the ground at the <br/>
birthday party!  They keep asking when the next one will be.  It was <br/>
so neat meeting all the letterboxers from the area, too.  It's great <br/>
to be able to put names and faces with stamps &amp; trail names.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for planning such a neat event!  Can't wait for the next <br/>
one.  I felt like it was a giant Scout Camp for adults--with every T <br/>
crossed and every I dotted!  We had so much fun!!!<br/>
