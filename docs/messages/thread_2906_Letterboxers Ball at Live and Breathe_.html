Speaking of Live and Breathe...I had the chance to walk some of the <br>
trails a bit more this weekend with some of the other committee <br>
members, and we were blown away by how perfect this place will be for <br>
us!  The trails, trees, cabins...everything...down to the dining <br>
halls!  Our host there is truly a letterboxing kindred spirit, and will <br>
be part of our wonderful little hobby I'm sure!<br>
<br>
There is so much creativity and forethought being poured into this <br>
weekend...I can't wait to be in the middle of it!  So many little <br>
surprises and wonderful things are in store for us all.  <br>
