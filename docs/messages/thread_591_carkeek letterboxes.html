i went out with a friend to carkeek the other day to show him what <br/>
this letterboxing thing was all about. we started with this letterbox:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=3761&amp;boxname=Carkeek<br/>
(not the salmon series or the fairy tale series). i see the site says <br/>
that it has been abandoned. well, the whole trail has been maintained <br/>
and so almost all of the clues are irrelevant. i did find the log <br/>
that's mentioned at the end but there are so many tree limbs and <br/>
other plant matter from them cleaning up the trail piled there that <br/>
finding the box was impossible. i'm sure it's gone. has anyone else <br/>
found it or been by? what's the best way of dealing with this? does <br/>
anyone know who originally created this box, as it no longer says on <br/>
the website? it should probably be removed, considering how much the <br/>
trail has been changed.<br/>
<br/>
on a lighter note, the salmon series was great! we had a great time <br/>
and loved the clues. we even bumped into our first geocacher! and <br/>
tried to convert them! it was a group of 4 kids plus their dad with a <br/>
gps. i had seen them near the 2nd box and then they were near the <br/>
3rd. he asked me whether i had found "it" yet, although when i told <br/>
him we were letterboxing, he had never heard of it. i normally don't <br/>
mention what i'm doing to random strangers but i felt sorry for the <br/>
kids, trailing behind the dad. after we found the 3rd box (loaded <br/>
with geocacher's finding it by accident amd it was not at all hidden) <br/>
we wandered back towards the sounds of their voices. i've never seen <br/>
a cache - i was curious. as we got closer, all of the kids were on <br/>
the trail and they accosted me with questions. what is letterboxing? <br/>
do you have to tromp through the woods? are there spider webs? you <br/>
get the picture. they were all under 10 and were not at all having <br/>
fun geocaching. dad was tromping around in the woods off the trail, <br/>
obviously very irriated at not finding it with the quickly setting <br/>
sun. i showed the kids the stamps we had found and told them about <br/>
it - they were very excited about it, for obvious reasons. i hope <br/>
that they have a chance to get involved with it, rather than standing <br/>
around bored on the trail, asking dad every 2 minutes whether he had <br/>
found it yet...<br/>
<br/>
can i say that i've been out letterboxing 5 times in the past 7 days <br/>
with 4 different people? i've only just begun but am very addicted! <br/>
the next challenge will be to hunt for the black rock desert mystery <br/>
box... wooboy. does THAT look challenging or what?!<br/>

<br/>
I volunteered to "adopt" this box, but never got any reply.<br/>
<br/>
It was there a couple of months ago, but I haven't been back since the <br/>
trail cleanup.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I am leaving on vacation tomorrow morning.<br/>
I will check it when I get back, and if it is all right with the placer,<br/>
redo the clues (I hope they didn't get rid of the 'dragon tree') if <br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
I can try to re-carve the stamp, but I haven't done anything that <br/>
intricate yet.<br/>
It's a beautiful stamp so I hope it is still there under the debris.<br/>
<br/>
I will check on it after the 27th when I'm back in town.<br/>
