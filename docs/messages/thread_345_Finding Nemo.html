One of the first things that Ryan had to do when he came off the <br>
trail in Waynesboro, was go to see Nemo! He is also a big Pixar fan. <br>
<br>
It would definitely make a great series. Especially since it has <br>
a "finding" theme! Maybe one of those series where you have to go to <br>
one box to find the clues to the next. Find Martin and Dory first and <br>
then off to find the Shark, then the Sea Turtle, then Gill and <br>
finally little Nemo!<br>
