North Fork Dry Diggins, Wheres the fire, and US I-40.<br>
I really like the idea of using the magnetic boxes, I might try one. <br>
But with "Wheres the fire" I was a little worried I looked like a <br>
terrorist replacing it under the postal drop in front of that <br>
particular building at such a busy intersection. I was a little <br>
concerned one might think I was placing a bomb there haha  so I just <br>
pretended to tie my shoes and sneakily replaced it. <br>

When we posted the note from Officer Ed and included the note in the <br>
clues we did receive a few negative notes from some folks via "Contact <br>
the Placer", but since Officer Ed replaced the letterbox in it's <br>
hiding spot it seemed to us that he understood the nature of the game. <br>
We figured that the box may be short lived due to it's urban setting, <br>
but during it's lifetime it will get some adrenalin pumping. The <br>
entire Auburn Police Dept. probably keeps watch on that spot just to <br>
keep tabs on the letterbox.<br>

Well then this must be the best protected LB anywhere!!  :o) I wish all <br>
the cops kept tabs on my letterboxes to discourage vandalism... just <br>
kidding! :o) <br>
dvntrckr has talked to me alot about the horrible vandalisms done to <br>
her boxes and ones she has found. Many were stolen, destroyed, <br>
vandelized, put porn in them, or wrote murder stories in the logbook <br>
and syringes and other bad stuff. Hmm, thats very mean of someone to do <br>
that, but I guess there is always gonna be those kinds of people out <br>
there no matter what we do. <br>
