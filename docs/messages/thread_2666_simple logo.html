                    <div class="plaintext-content">One of the classiest color combination I've seen is a small dark brown &amp;<br/>
white image on a muted, medium green shirt.  This also has a nice, woodsy<br/>
appeal.  If anyone is interested I can upload the image (not sure I have<br/>
access?).  It's not the Lb logo just an example of color combo.<br/>
<br/>
I love the simplicity and look of Wildhair's simple logo.  The tear-drop<br/>
shape is so fitting of the PNW (especially lately, huh?.  If you guys want<br/>
to stay with the lime green and orange - what color would set it off?  Hmmm<br/>
Possibly a dark green?  I did a little independent test in my closet and<br/>
found that a dark, forest green seems to fight the least with the lime<br/>
green.  Browns should work with orange but I couldn't find a brown that<br/>
complimented the patch colors as well as the dark green.   Maybe someone<br/>
else  (Wildhair?) with a good sense of colors has a better idea?<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long time since I've done a T-shirt design but I imagine this is<br/>
all contingent on what color long sleeve shirts are available. So the above<br/>
may be all for not.   ?<br/>
<br/>
As far as cost - if it's not appealing it doesn't matter how inexpensive it<br/>
is - I won't buy it because I wouldn't wear it.   Long sleeve T-shirt prices<br/>
are all over the place, but as of late, I've spotted some as low as $20 . .<br/>
. at an airport, no less!  Of course that's retail, with a logo - we should<br/>
be able to get shirts for less.  Some crafts stores carry blank T-shirts for<br/>
crafters that are surprisingly low priced.  Mostly white though.<br/>
<br/>
I keep telling myself I won't post on this again.  Well, it seems I can't<br/>
resist!   * laugh *<br/>

  Just saw the simple logo in the File section. Works for me.<br/>
<br/>
  But would a single color be better ? Just black ink on any color<br/>
  and just white on a black shirt. This might also be more "guy<br/>
  friendly".<br/>
