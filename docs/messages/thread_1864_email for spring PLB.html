Hi, <br>
If you signed up for the spring postal letterbox could you please <br>
private message me with your e-mail. As I got the mail I deleted <br>
messages and have no idea which email goes with which person. My <br>
plan is to e-mail each person when it is time to send it to the next <br>
person to make sure you still want it. This way we can keep it <br>
moving. Obviously this is my first box. I am so organized. :-) This <br>
would be a big help. Please email me your address and name. We as of <br>
now have 49 names on the list.<br>
