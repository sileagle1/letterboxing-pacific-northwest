I've missed it!  Lacamas Creek is alive and well, although it hadn't <br>
had a visitor since early November.  Has anyone adopted this box (one <br>
of Der Mad Stampers)?  It's in good shape (except for a ton of sap on <br>
the outside of the box) but the log book is full.<br>
<br>
Big thanks to Sleepy Whippet for planting some boxes out in East <br>
County that I could get in the dark on my way to work.  Sometimes <br>
that's all the boxing I can get in, and I can't wait for the sun to <br>
come up sooner.  You Betcha is a terrific stamp and the clues lead <br>
you right to it (love those!).  Olive & Stine are great, but just a <br>
hint for those of you who box in pantyhose...watch out for the <br>
blackberry bushes!  They are small but mighty stickery (kind of a <br>
Audrey II kind of thing going on there).<br>
<br>
Minibullymom, Sleepy Whippet and I met up ringside at the dog show on <br>
Monday for a quick exchange.  I just realized that we should have <br>
gotten your dog's footprint while we were there!  I hope you found <br>
PDX Equus okay.  You'll have to come back to Portland so we can box <br>
together.<br>
<br>
Hope everyone else got to get out and find a few boxes.<br>
