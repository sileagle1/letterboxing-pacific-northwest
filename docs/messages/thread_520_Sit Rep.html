A SitRep is a military non-word meaning "Situation Report".  Since I spent 10 years in the military it came across as a natural way for me to share my exploits with the list.  SitRep is the same as [STATE] Box Report, or whatever subject the person cares to use in my NOT so humble opinion.<br>

Hah!  I just thought we were protesting the word SitRep.  Your posts are <br>
fine!  If someone doesn't want to read them, then ya know what?  They don't have <br>
to.  Keep posting your SitReps, and phooey on anyone who doesn't like them.  At <br>
least the posts are on topic.  :o)<br>

The nonsense that is going on about the SitRep thing on the national list is<br>
just the kind of thing that prompted the creation of the LbPNW list,  we on<br>
the West side were just fed up with their petty bickering.<br>
<br>

><br>
When posting to the national list, begin your subject line with the State<br>
Abbreviation of the location of the lrtbx.<br>
As WA - letterbox status report; or OR - new letterbox; or ID - Lost HH<br>
found;  or CA - new letterbox attire report.<br>

Refer to second paragraph in this original post.....<br>

The bottom line: this activity and participants are creative enough that we<br>
should be able to come up with terms that are not *stolen* from some other<br>

That being said, I'll shut-up and crawl back into my hole and prepare for<br>

I thought the whole point of the talk pages was to give updates on boxes.  Whether they need attention; wet, full log, missing, landscape changes.  I read the pages to get that kind of info; whether people liked what they found or had difficulties, what to watch out for, like nettles or pioson ivy/oak is of great benefit.  It's the chit chat that bogs down the talk pages not the updates and adventures and stories of the boxers.  That is what it is all about.  I like reading what you write Rayvenhaus.   <br>

I gain info about interesting and sometimes challenging boxes.<br>

I get a glimpse of the personality of the members.<br>

It gets me inspired to try to get out on weekends and box.<br>

I loved the story about flapping arms at trains.  Silly fun that <br>
reminded me that the former bridge on Hwy 99 over the Puyallup River <br>
in Tacoma is known in our family as the Pipe Ears bridge or the Tick <br>
Tock bridge.  <br>
<br>
We need to smile in our day to day world and if these reports don't <br>
do it then :-p  .<br>

My time my fun. Make and take of anything what YOU will, but leave <br>
me the ingredients to make my own delight.<br>

Well, who's to say what clutters up the list and what doesn't? I for<br>
one enjoy reading your sitreps Team Rayvenhaus and hope you continue<br>
to post them. In fact I enjoy reading just about all of the reports<br>
posted on the list and I fail to see why anyone would suggest that<br>
only certain posts could be made. And I am really sorry that there are<br>
posts that have turned ugly to the point of hurting feelings over a<br>
subject so trivial as which words to use in a header.<br>
<br>
I say potato you say pahtato,<br>
You say tomato I say tahmato,<br>
Tomato, tahmato, potato, pahtato,<br>
Lets work the whole thing out.<br>
<br>
Or something like that.<br>
