<br>
Gosh Iron`Bear and I are sorry we would love to carpool with you - if only<br>
we had a bigger car.  We have a full load already with Sim Kitty and one of<br>
her good friends. :) -- I know a few people headed that way though and I<br>
will mention to them that you are looking for a carpool -- I do know that<br>
even if you have to make the drive alone there will be tons of friendly<br>
wonderful people at the gathering and you definitely won't have to letterbox<br>
alone.<br>
<br>
Iron`Bear and I will talk to some people though let us know if something<br>
else pans out for you :) I can't wait to get that beautiful new signature<br>
stamp of yours I have been seeing around.<br>
<br>
