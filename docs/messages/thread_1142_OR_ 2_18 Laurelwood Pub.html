wonderful little neighborhood gathering place. The fact that the art on the walls is <br>
somehow related to my household has nothing to do with my opinion.  <br>
<br>
Laurelwood is a half block north of Sandy Blvd on NE 40th, within hollerin' distance of <br>
the Hollywood Theater and about four blocks north of the Hollywood Max station. It <br>
seems that the He Who Hikes the AT and She With Wings will be traveling from points <br>
north for the occassion. A couple of the local crew have said they'd be there, too. <br>
Anyone else I don't know about? Funhog<br>
