So I headed out today to grab 4 of the 8 boxes in the Spokane <br/>
area:)....All are alive and well:<br/>
<br/>
Snow Days (great spot, nice view)<br/>
<br/>
Pine Rock (still there, hope the neighbours were not watching)<br/>
<br/>
100 Years at Montrose (great clues, nice view)<br/>
<br/>
Forever in Bloom (good clues, quick grab)<br/>
<br/>
Note I found the "E" hitch hiker in the Forever in Bloom box however <br/>
folks appeared to stop indicating where it was found and hid in <br/>
June/July.....so I am not sure how it got to Spokane WA from the <br/>
Western WA area....it has gone as far as Shasta though...so the Nail <br/>
family it has been travelling! Just a reminder to make sure to <br/>
document where hitch hikers are found and dropped off....and by whom:)<br/>
<br/>
Also Mouse in the House is alive and well.<br/>

Canada Goose<br/>

What a treat to find out that someone found our first planted box, 100 Years at Montrose!  We checked on it for the first time on Sunday and found Canada Goose's stamp there.  We also added another box in the same park and posted the clues Sunday night.  Sorry CD, if we'd gotten our act together just a little bit earlier you would have had 2 to find.<br/>
