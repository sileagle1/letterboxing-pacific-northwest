                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got home last night from a very loooooong weekend in the high desert. While I <br/>
was basking in the sun there, I managed to track down some boxes that have been on <br/>
my list for some time. <br/>
<br/>
The Fleshman's Haystack Resevoir box has a lovely stamp in it (did I expect anything <br/>
less?) and the view from the hiding place is stunning, especially with the late <br/>
afternoon light. Birder's Dry River Canyon boxes in Powell Butte presented a challenge <br/>
or two. The location of these two wonderful letterboxes is deep in the heart of posted <br/>
private property. I suspect that it was open range when these were planted since the <br/>
barbed wire and signage looks new an shiny. Since there was no one about but me <br/>
and one hereford with huge horns, I decided to put on my scofflaw hat and find the <br/>
boxes anyway. I made it out unscathed, not in legal custody and with two intricate <br/>
stamps in my book. The spot is beautiful but I can't recommend the legality of the <br/>
finds.<br/>
<br/>
Another of my recent discoveries was a great trail on Crooked River Ranch. It is <br/>
naturally now home to some new letterboxes. Just think, you can come to Central <br/>
Oregon and collect my very first stamps (really bad) and my most recent ones (not so <br/>
bad) in the same day! Then there are the other treats from Amanda, the Fleshmans, <br/>
birder and the Nail Family awaiting you... <br/>
