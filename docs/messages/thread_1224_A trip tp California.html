My family and I are leaving for Spring Break in a week, are there <br/>
any easy boxes along I-5?  We are leaving from Vancouver, WA towards <br/>
San Francisco and them on to Disneyland.  I will not have time for <br/>
hours of boxing and my husband has never got to experience the love <br/>
of Letterboxing yet.  Since time will be short I was hoping for a <br/>
few quick finds along the way.  Any help would be greatly <br/>
appreciated.  Willow.<br/>
