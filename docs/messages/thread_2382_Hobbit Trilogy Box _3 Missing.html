of my Hobbit Trilogy series is missing.  I went to check it out on our <br>
2 day break from the rain and it is definitely not there.  Will try to <br>
replace it as soon as the weather gives a break.  If anyone attempted <br>
it after it was lost e-mail me and I will happily send you the stamp <br>
and your share of the treasure for completing the journey.  H-A-F<br>
