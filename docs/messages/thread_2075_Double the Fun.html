In case anyone has missed seeing the clues, <br>
I want to point everyone in the direction of the <br>
new Great Outdoors series. After several days of letterboxing,<br>
I have managed to track down all the goodies in this very cute<br>
and very long series. I even managed to experience my first<br>
letterboxing at midnight experience along the way. Well... it<br>
was only 11 PM but I do think that's close enough. <br>
<br>
Kudos to Double Tree. The stamps look very cool in my <br>
book; the clues have a clever twist; and the locations are <br>
fun to visit. I know this was a ton of work so I don't want <br>
to appear too greedy but...  I AM a Pig, after all. <br>
Gimme More! <br>
<br>
Many thanks, Funhog<br>

You are kind to say such things about the boxes, Funhog.  But, the <br>
pleasure truly was all mine.  I'm hooked.<br>
