                    <div class="plaintext-content">ooh, I went there, too!  I was visiting an aunt and uncle who live just a couple of miles from the dog park.  My aunt and I found one box in the area, and that's all it took to get my uncle intrigued.  (She still didn't really get it....but then I don't get quilting all that much, either!)  He insisted that we try to find the dog park box(es?) late that night and found the biggest flashlight he owned.  We never did find the box, but we accidentally found a geocache.  Or maybe it was a letterbox with no stamp...?  Anyway, we found the bunch at the hatchery, too.  My uncle lamented the fact that he hadn't brought his fishing pole (as if he could even use it.....).  Glad to hear they're still around, since we had fun when we were there.<br>
   <br>
  I took advantage of the nice weather, too, to find a few boxes here in South Puget Sound area.  Gold Medal Winner, Circle of Life, and BYOHFS were all on the agenda.  Found the Gold Medal just fine.  It's been ages since I last heard of the Quanns!  I went to school with them, but Megan was a couple of years younger than I was so she was friends with my younger sister.  Neat to hear their fame lives on!  Finally found Chrysotile's Circle of Life, after proofreading her clues nearly a year ago while she tagged along and made notes.  Unfortunately, some Geocachers got confused or something and left some band-aids for the stamp, so the box was down and out for a time.  It's fine now, though!  After finding THE DISH for the hot fudge sundae, I got a little too hungry, myself, and broke for lunch and to wash my car (IT NEEDED IT).  The rest of my sundae will have to wait for another day, perhaps one when my little sister (who's just gotten into letterboxing) is free to go with.<br>

  I can't imagine you guys not eating during a whole day of 'boxing!  When my friend and I (both rather unemployed for a summer during college) went for full-day 'boxing adventures a week at a time, she drove and I planned the lunches.  We nearly ate an entire package of E.L.Fudge cookies while 'boxing in Golden Ears Provincial Park one day!  But we left my house at 7 AM and left the park at sundown (running to make it before the gates closed!) so it wasn't THAT bad of us....haha....  Ah, the good ol' days of 'boxing 'til we dropped!<br>

Yeah, that starts to happen after the 'newness' of letterboxing wears<br>
off. You're willing to take more breaks for things like resting and<br>
eating. ;o)<br>
