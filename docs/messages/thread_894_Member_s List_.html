<br/>
There you go Ryan excellent choice I think, I was going to give my <br/>
two cents worth anyways and say that people should already be aware <br/>
of the potential for their e-mail address to be made available to the <br/>
general public, and if you 'join' a public group even more so. In my <br/>
opinion it is no different from your phone number or your house <br/>
address it is a given fact that each of those will be a matter of <br/>
public record unless you make precautions to not have that occur. In <br/>
today's world everyone has an e-mail address it seems, and if you <br/>
want your e-mail address to be protected then there are certainly <br/>
precautions that can be taken. Having the members list available is <br/>
of benefit I think and should be done. <br/>
<br/>
Once again good forethought Ryan<br/>
<br/>
I bid you well. <br/>
