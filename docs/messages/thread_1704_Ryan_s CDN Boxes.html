Hopefully it won't take us that long to follow them. By the way, in our neck<br/>
of the woods - any reference to "ears" would automatically send folk off to<br/>
"Golden Ears", good thing you were more specific. :0)<br/>

Subject: An OLD Der Mad Box - The Raptor?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Halloo to All,<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to get a little help regarding a box DMS placed somewhat <br/>
near me back in 2000. (And thanks, Mitch, BTW, for doing that recent <br/>
interview with Mark. I really enjoyed learning more about you and <br/>
about the hobby. Especially here in the PNW.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, about a month ago I sent out a request on the main talk list <br/>
to ask if this box was still active. (I didn't realize DMS wasn't <br/>
active at the time. =) I did receive a reply from someone who said <br/>
they had found the box in 2003, and it was safe and sound. I figured <br/>
it was worth a shot and headed out to find a couple boxes yesterday <br/>
afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
I was completely skunked by the clues to "The Raptor" letterbox - I <br/>
walked them through completely twice(just paces and compass <br/>
bearings), and my ending points were at least 50 feet apart. Neither <br/>
place looked to have a prime spot for placing a letterbox. So, I <br/>
have no doubt it was my interpretation of the clues giving me fits. <br/>
I WAS carrying my 15-month-old and trying to watch for snakes and <br/>
gopher holes (both of which I found!) This no doubt made my paces <br/>
uneven and I had trouble finding enough landmarks to make sure I was <br/>
keeping the correct bearing in the first place. I think this is one <br/>
I need to do with a partner.<br/>
<br/>
After all this preamble, I'll get to my question...=) Could someone <br/>
who knows about this box please email me offlist and cofirm for me <br/>
whether or not I was in the correct area? I don't want any <br/>
additional clues, but I do need to know if the box is beyond the <br/>
barbed-wire fence as that area is off-limits to foot traffic at this <br/>
time. You CAN get back there through gates, but they are trying to <br/>
preserve that area for native plants and I don't feel right tromping <br/>
out there just because *I* have a good reason. =) I did find one set <br/>
of rather distinctive rocks I felt could be near the hiding place. <br/>
If I'm warm, I'd appreciate some confirmation. I'll just put it on <br/>
my list to check in another 6 months or so. If that doesn't sound <br/>
right, I'll just keep looking! But, I'll take a baby tender next <br/>
time. =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Took me awhile to get to it, but I finally wrote up the clues for my<br/>
Canadian boxes.  =)<br/>

Dear Grifos,<br/>
<br/>
I hope you'll forgive me for answering you on the list, rather than <br/>
in private.  If I'm going to share info with you, I might as well <br/>
share with everyone....<br/>
<br/>
No, the Raptor letterbox is not beyond the fence in the protected <br/>
area.  Nor is it at a set of distinctive rocks.  As far as I know, <br/>
the box is still alive and well.  Please confirm, if you find it.  <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, look out for those snakes and gophers!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>

<br/>
I finally got around to revisiting my letterbox at Lacamas Creek, in <br/>
Washington state today.  I have revised the clues to reflect changes <br/>
in the local terrain.<br/>
<br/>
http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/lacamas.htm<br/>
<br/>
As you may know, I have a long-standing commitment to helping pass <br/>
along my devious and merciless ways to the next generation of <br/>
letterboxers.  Consequently, I took my latest understudy, Sim Kitty <br/>
of Team Chaos, along with me today.  While we were there, we managed <br/>
to place a second letterbox along the same creek.  We make a wicked <br/>
team, Sim Kitty and I... we truly doubt if ANY of you will EVER be <br/>
able to find this one!  Go ahead... knock yourselves out!  We dare <br/>
you.<br/>

&gt; Gee Ryan, easy to see why it took you so long to write up the<br/>
&gt; clues!!!!<br/>
<br/>
*hehe*  Hey, those clues took a lot longer to come up with than you<br/>
could imagine!  I didn't want to hide just a run-of-the-mill box<br/>
(nobody would believe it was really me hiding the boxes if I did<br/>
that!), but I didn't stay at the park long enough to make diabolical<br/>
clues either.  So I sat looking at my notes wondering how I could<br/>
possibily make them more cryptic.  Didn't have any pictures of plaques<br/>
for another infamous walking tour.  Didn't bring a compass to make<br/>
another Applegate Rest Area.  I didn't have nothing for a good clue.<br/>
<br/>
Took me until yesterday to finally figure out a somewhat<br/>
crptic--though not especially difficult--clue.  =)<br/>
