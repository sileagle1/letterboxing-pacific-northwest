                    <div class="plaintext-content"> The Silver Falls lunch crowd was so very welcoming! We were feeling a<br>
bit nervous, like most would, approaching a picnic table with a bunch<br>
of people, not knowing a soul and not even sure we're in the right<br>
place! Right away the open log books signaled that we were in the<br>
right place and Wild Woman welcomed us into the fold.  I was so happy<br>
to meet some of the people whose beautiful boxes we've found at lovely<br>
and interesting places in the past two years (August.) Seeing all the<br>
stamping kits and stamp carving tech talk was fun.<br>
 Thanks to Pungent Bob for organizing the event, sorry we didn't get<br>
to meet you, but loved those Krispy Kremes! Thanks also for the<br>
beautiful event stamp from Der Mad Stamper. That was worth the trip in<br>
itself! And Amanda Briles, the Paisley Orca, (I love your North Head<br>
Lighthouse stamp, by the way, one of our cherished early finds)--<br>
Mandy! It was great to get reaquainted, whoever brief. Your spirit is<br>
as bright as I remember, from 20 years ago! Very happy also to meet<br>
Doublesaj and Old Blue from CA! Did you get your 500?  We hiked the<br>
quiet and beautiful Shellburg Trail, found Funhog's great boxes, a HH<br>
and had a rejuvinating afternoon. Then off to the St. John Rodeo (talk<br>
about a contrast.)<br>
 We had a really nice time!! <br>
