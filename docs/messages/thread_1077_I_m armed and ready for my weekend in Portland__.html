                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yup..with lots of help from Sleepy Whippet and Bookworm I'm ready to <br>
attack several Portland boxes. I'm also going to try ...schedule <br>
permitting...some boxes in the Hillsboro/Beaverton area. <br>
<br>
I think I have solved the PDX Equus clues and I have it narrowed down <br>
to two locations. If all goes well I'll be able to eliminate one of <br>
the possiblities on Sat or Sun and that will leave me MOnday evening <br>
to get the other possibility checked. HOpefully one of them will <br>
be "paydirt". <br>
<br>
I'm going to meet up with SleepyWhippet (and possibly BookWorm) at <br>
the Dog Show on Monday! We are going to exchange some stamps and <br>
visit. <br>
<br>
I'm thinking about attacking the Audobon Nature Sanctuary boxes. DOes <br>
anyone have a current status of them? And which boxes are actually <br>
located there. I know that Willard Stump and What's for Dinner are <br>
locate there...are there any others?<br>
<br>
Since I will be at the Expo Center I'm going to be able to do Smith <br>
and Bybee easily. I may get a local map and attack a few others time <br>
permitting. I'm going to also try to catch a Red Squirrel too. <br>
<br>
I will also be launching some hitchhikers my kids and a couple of <br>
their friends have carved. Please make allowances when you come <br>
across them. Their logbooks are very rudimentary (them made them <br>
themselves) but their stamps are pretty cute for being mad by 10-12 <br>
year olds. I also have a HH that I found this past week that I'm <br>
going to send across the border. <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

I haven't been out to check on my What's for Dinner boxes there recently. There are <br>
tons of others in that area since there was a gathering held in Macleay Park, adjacent <br>
to the Sanctuary in August 2002.<br>

You will be very close to the interstate bridge. There are several boxes just across the <br>
river in Vancouver. Have fun! Funhog<br>
