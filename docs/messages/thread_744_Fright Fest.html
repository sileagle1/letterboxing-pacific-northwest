<br/>
You need to only bring yourself and a covered dish of some kind. Nothing<br/>
else is required, though anything else is greatly appreciated.  Bring your<br/>
current personal stamp for exchanges, but nothing else is needed. If you<br/>
want to carve a new traveler, by all means, dive in, the more stamps the<br/>
merrier I say.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what we of Team Rayvenhaus are doing, other than the food and the<br/>
fellowship, is....<br/>
<br/>
We are carving a new 'Themed' series to be placed for that day, with a<br/>
bonus. Find all of the hidden ones and show proof and there's a double<br/>
secret probation letterbox that you'll be privy to.  We are also taking<br/>
boxes that others from around the country in the letterbox community want to<br/>
create and send along and placing them in the area as well.  We are carving<br/>
a new Hitchhiker to release that day AND have carved a new sig stamp for<br/>
Rayvenhaus which is, in my opinion, just too funny and fitting for this<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if there are any other activities that anyone else thinks might be a<br/>
great idea, please don't hesitate to let us know now so we can coordinate<br/>
them.  We'd be happen to add anything that we can to this gathering to make<br/>
it more fun for all.<br/>
<br/>
Please, if you have ideas, drop us a line off list and let us know.<br/>

traveling letterboxes, plus we are brining a few boxes from the East <br/>
Coast that have landed in our possession since I have been sick...<br/>
<br/>
The Colorado Explore with a traveling pet named Sudsie<br/>
The Massachusetts Chickadee Hitchhiker<br/>
Franzolo MMII Microbox Hitchhiker<br/>
<br/>
Plus we will be brining the Boredom Buster Letterbox just to show <br/>
everyone and let them take a look at since the box is so cool.<br/>
<br/>
These 5 boxes are pretty nifty since they are from all over the <br/>
country.<br/>

Plus the new Team Chaos releases are pretty damn cool if I do say so <br/>
myself.<br/>
