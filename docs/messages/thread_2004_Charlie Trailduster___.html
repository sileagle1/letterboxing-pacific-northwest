Hey folks,<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick shout out to Charlie Trailduster as I can't figure out his <br/>
website URL or email address right now as we scramble to head out the <br/>
door to catch a flight.  Charlie--we're heading to Chejudo in a couple <br/>
of hours.  We'll think of you and your funny stories from the region <br/>
when we're down there.  Thanks for sharing them with us!  Definitely <br/>
part of the inspiration for us to take the trip there!<br/>
<br/>
We'll keep you posted on our experience when we return.  Still can't <br/>
believe you got to go there for WORK!!!  ;)<br/>
