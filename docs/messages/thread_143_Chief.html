And I had talked to my husband several times about that darned <br/>
box--(including how Heather was obsessing about it so much during the day <br/>
that she was dreaming about finding it at night.  He'd even suggested I talk <br/>
to a friend who grew up in Hillsboro and might be able to figure it out...  <br/>
So after he nonchalantly informed me where it was--and  after I'd stopped <br/>
sputtering and was able to demand why he hadn't thought to mention this <br/>
before--his response was a shrug and "I don't think you ever told me the <br/>
clues."  "THERE ARE NO CLUES," I yowled--as if I had not mentioned this <br/>
salient fact about Chief Kno-Tah repeatedly !!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Obviously what hubby &amp; I have had here is a failure to communicate.<br/>
