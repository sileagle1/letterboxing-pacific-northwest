is missing.  As I'm essentially out of the letterboxing net for most <br>

interested in looking for it.<br>
<br>
Other boxes of ours that are missing or most likely missing include:<br>
<br>
Dolphin Mystery (confirmed missing from its hiding spot--although it <br>
could very likely be embedded in mud all around the area?)<br>
<br>
Kite LB (Ilwaco--most likely missing, not verified)<br>
Big, Bare Foot in Burfoot (Boston Harbor, possibly MIA, not verified)<br>
Goldfish (Lacey, possibly MIA, not verified)<br>
West Point Mule (Seattle, possibly MIA, not verified)<br>
Crystal Creek Falls (CA, most likely MIA, not verified)<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are others--these are just ones we've heard about <br>
recently.<br>
<br>
Ones that have been confirmed recently as still alive & well despite <br>
myriad missing reports include:<br>
<br>
Eggceptional Mystery<br>
Ecola (Oregon)<br>
Cold Moon over Puget Sound<br>
Bastion (VA)<br>
Charles' Jazzy STreetcar (New Orleans, LA)<br>
It's Raining Animals (Olympia--all 4 are alive & well)<br>
Mushroom & Fern (both were alive & well)<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are a bunch of others in this category, too, but my <br>
memory escapes me at the moment.<br>

Hope to see you on the trails in the Fall,  :(<br>

the Polar Bear box as well. Camp Fire Lady, Iron`Bear, Cat's Meow and I all<br>
went for it when we were down there for the Mystery Meet.  We spent a long<br>
time looking for that box to no avail, but we also gathered some wonderfully<br>
large and beautiful sea shells in the sore down there, in tack, unbroken,<br>
what a wonderful place! Thank you so much for taking us there we had a ball!<br>
I just love sea treasures and watching Iron`Bear and Cat's Meow hunt them<br>
down was one of the highlights of that trip!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I'd love to go again and hope you replace the Polar Bear! <br>
