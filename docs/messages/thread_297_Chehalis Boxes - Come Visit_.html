<br>
Seminary Hill is a hill!  Nice and quiet, very wooded, good views of the city.  Tweet and Sylvestre are doing well, but need visitors, I was the first.  Left a little something to help Syl dine, check it out.<br>
<br>
Went Buggy!  Had to wait until the prospectors (two gents with metal detectors) gave up and moved on, then found the elusive bug.  Thought I had firsties, but no :-(  Two boxer's new to me had graduated from Trial and Error's Advanced Letterboxing Class, they had stamped in in the wrong end of the log.  At least they found the box.<br>
<br>
Schaefer County Park is nice, small but cute.  Found the Lost Train while the Big Train went by.<br>
<br>
If you are passing thru the Centralia area, stop for a rewarding visit.<br>
