afford to have a laptop to travel with and I rely on free internet <br/>
service at Public Libraries all over the country. If you find <br/>
yourself someplace without letterbox clues. The Library is a great <br/>
resource! (the Libraries on the West Coast are especially <br/>
accommodating! In Las Vegas you can get up to 2 hours on the <br/>
internet...in North Carolina on the other hand, they only let you <br/>
have 15 or 30 minutes at the most!)  One library I went to on the <br/>
East Coast had dozens of computers available, but because I was a <br/>
visitor (without a local library card), I could only use one specific <br/>
computer. There was a wait for it! Even though half of the other <br/>
computers were available!! Weird!<br/>
