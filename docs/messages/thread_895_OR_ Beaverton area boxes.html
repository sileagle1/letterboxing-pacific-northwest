Hello,<br/>
I work in the Natural Resources Department for Tualatin Hills Park and<br/>
Recreation District.  I monitor Geocaches in District parks and recently have<br/>
begun monitoring letterboxes in our parks as well.  My main concern is for the<br/>
safety of our park patrons, including those seeking Geocaches and letterboxes. <br/>
As such, if I note a Geocache or letterbox in a place that poses a hazard to<br/>
the seeker I will ask that the hider remove it, or move it to a new location<br/>
pending our Department's approval of the new location.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I have found approximately 25 letterboxes listed as hidden in 19<br/>
District Parks.  I spent today attempting to verify the locations of several<br/>
Geocaches and to find 5 letterboxes.  Two letterboxes were not located, but<br/>
both locations were hazardous to seekers due to potential animal encounters,<br/>
dangerous stream banks, or dangerous stream crossings (Fanno Creek Greenway<br/>
Letterboxes).  When I attempted to contact the letterboxer that placed the box<br/>
about these hazards, the email came back as undeliverable.<br/>
<br/>
This brings up several questions:<br/>
1) How often do the old letterboxes get deleted from your system (i.e., those<br/>
that are inactive or missing)?<br/>
2) How often do you ask letterbox hiders to monitor and maintain their boxes<br/>
(there is nothing mentioned about this in the waivers section of your webpage)?<br/>
3) Especially in light of heightened security worldwide since 9/11, there is<br/>
great concern for safety of public buildings and structures.  I see nothing in<br/>
your waivers section that suggest that letterbox placers do NOT place boxes in<br/>
public buildings, in or near utilities or utility structures, or where a<br/>
letterbox may be suspected as a threat to the public (e.g., on bridges).  What<br/>
do you advise letterboxers when reviewing letterbox locations?<br/>
4) There is no mention in the waivers section of contacting the public property<br/>
managers about letterboxes placed on lands which they manage.  What do you<br/>
advise letterboxers when their locations are on lands managed by public<br/>
agencies (e.g., parks)?<br/>
<br/>
I have a very good working relationship with the Geocaching community and would<br/>
like to establish such a relationship with the letterboxing community.  To that<br/>
end, I ask that all letterbox hiders, who wish to place a letterbox in one of<br/>
our parks, contact our office prior to letterbox placement so we may review the<br/>
location and the clues.  Most of the letterboxes I discovered online, listed<br/>
the park name and location (e.g., Hyland Forest, Beaverton, Oregon).  This is<br/>
quite helpful and allows me to quickly review the local letterboxes to see<br/>
which ones are in our parks.  I trust you will ask the specific location of the<br/>
letterbox when it is entered as a 'mystery' location (e.g., The Imposter, ???,<br/>
OR) so that you will know to request that we are contacted by the letterbox<br/>
hider prior to its placement.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your consideration of these matters.  I look forward to working<br/>
with the Letterboxing community.<br/>

Now that's twisted.  He actually got paid to solve crytograms before <br/>
he got paid to actually find those boxes!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should let him in on the fact that the box over the creek is <br/>
missing.  The "dangerous stream banks" one is still there, though, as <br/>
far as I know.  But it's a typical, hard-to-reach and easy-to-miss <br/>
DMS box, so I'm not surprised he missed it.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose my Murder at Gabriel Park series might be under the gun, <br/>
but those are the only ones I've hidden in any Portland city parks.  <br/>
What territory, exactly, does the Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation <br/>
District cover?  The whole Portland metro area?  The <br/>
Beaverton/Hillsboro area?<br/>
<br/>
Ho hum, ho hum....  At least they seem open to the idea of <br/>
letterboxing.  That's a good start.  =)<br/>

Are you kidding?!  Rattlesnake is a killer!  Even the Great Turtle <br/>
had to rest a couple of times heading up that trail!  I'd rate that <br/>
hike as "moderate", I think.  =)<br/>

I wonder why he doesn't have an official  THPRD mail address?  <br/>
