<br>
You are the first person today to mention Elvis... I was so excited to not <br>
hear 'bout him today... All my life I've shared Elvis' bday, and as a child, <br>
I never understood why the news and everyone<br>
mentioned his bday and not mine... *grinz*<br>
<br>
And to answer your other question... I've been working on my houseplants... <br>
it's been a great distraction... and today I was able to get back to work... <br>
so no more cabin fever!<br>
<br>
Jessi<br>

making popcorn balls, and sliding on our front yard like otters.  Both kids<br>
discovered they couldnt' walk but they could crawl on their hands and knees<br>
to the top of the incline then slide on their bellies down into the street.<br>
Great fun has been had by all but I'm very ready to call it quits.  School<br>
has already been called off for tomorrow so it looks like I'm going to be<br>
doing some more carving.<br>
<br>
The upside of this whole thing, I've greatly improved the quality of my<br>
boxes that I created this weekend.  I've spent much more time and energy<br>
into putting the "whole" together.  My books are much better and my stamps<br>
are better.  Hopefully it will thaw out soon so I can go hide them.<br>
<br>
I also recieved the Dead Horse Letterbox in the mail today, so Sunday is<br>
still on.  If you want to come and stamp into it (It's a wonderful stamp),<br>
before I send it on it's way, email me and I'll fill you in on the details.<br>
