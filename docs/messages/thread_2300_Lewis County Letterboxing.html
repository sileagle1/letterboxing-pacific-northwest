                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, all!  I just ventured south-ward for a little bit of letterboxing yesterday afternoon.  Hopefully I'm not spoiling anything here, but if you're worried I might, don't read on!  On the agenda were...<br>
   <br>
  Fallen Rainbow (dvn2rckr) (http://www.leecomputers.com/letterboxing/cgi-bin/boards/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=17&t=2)<br>
  I think the three boulders might be moved or missing, but we did find the box.  Unfortunately, the book was rather covered in mold and I didn't venture to even take it out of the bag.  Cute stamp, though!!<br>
   <br>
  Railroad Bridge Letterbox (The Nail Family) (http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=5400&boxname=Railroad_Bridge_Letterbox)<br>
  Got right to where the box should be, we think, but my boyfriend wouldn't let me do the climbing, so I have to trust his word that the box wasn't there.<br>
   <br>
  The Duel (dvn2rckr) (http://www.leecomputers.com/letterboxing/cgi-bin/boards/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=17&t=11)<br>
  We think we found the place, but we weren't certain of which post was actually Northernmost.  We checked behind a bunch of them, and where we think it should be may no longer be a good place.  They've decorated for Christmas, and some extention cord excess is coiled up there, so they may well have found the box and taken it.<br>
   <br>
  "Egg"ceptional Mystery (dvn2rckr) (http://www.leecomputers.com/letterboxing/cgi-bin/boards/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=17&t=10)<br>
  Found the egg (yay us! apparently, I went there when I was little, but I don't remember it!) and the park and even the turquoise 4, but we had some trouble past there.  Some discrepancies regarding the 27 steps, and we looked by a lot of roots, but didn't find the microbox.  It was getting a little darker by then, though, so visibility was low.<br>
   <br>
  1 out of 4; not great odds, but at least I worked off some Thanksgiving eets!  Thanks for the fun!<br>
