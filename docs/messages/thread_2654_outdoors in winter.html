<br/>
We are two parents and two little kids (2.5 and 5), and so far have done Ballard Bark Box and Go Sonics. Our kids had a blast and so did we, mostly watching them! We figure we can do more physically and mentally demanding ones as they grow...I think we've found a family activity with something for each of us to love.<br/>
