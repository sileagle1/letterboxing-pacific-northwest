<br/>
A charming, mature, ancient passtime started by a man<br/>
in 1854 involving censorship, rubber stamp artistry,<br/>
elements of hiking, treasure hunting, which involves<br/>
individuals searching the moors for hidden containers.<br/>
 It was brought to the usa (sic) from england (sic)<br/>
and discovered in a bathtub in april (sic) 1998. <br/>
(Sorry, am I making you all sic?)  It is an old<br/>
english passtime combining orienteering and <br/>
treasure which can be enjoyed by anyone, in<br/>
families/small groups, and is contageous.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is also a 'collection', although it is<br/>
not always the best solution.  But it is the most fun<br/>
with a companion anyway.  Regardless, letterboxing is<br/>
still the exception rather than the rule.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  I think I got most of it.  Thanks Dvn2rckr...<br/>
