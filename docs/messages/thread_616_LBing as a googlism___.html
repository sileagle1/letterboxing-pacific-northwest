<br>
A charming, mature, ancient passtime started by a man<br>
in 1854 involving censorship, rubber stamp artistry,<br>
elements of hiking, treasure hunting, which involves<br>
individuals searching the moors for hidden containers.<br>
 It was brought to the usa (sic) from england (sic)<br>
and discovered in a bathtub in april (sic) 1998. <br>
(Sorry, am I making you all sic?)  It is an old<br>
english passtime combining orienteering and <br>
treasure which can be enjoyed by anyone, in<br>
families/small groups, and is contageous.<br>
<br>
Letterboxing is also a 'collection', although it is<br>
not always the best solution.  But it is the most fun<br>
with a companion anyway.  Regardless, letterboxing is<br>
still the exception rather than the rule.<br>
<br>
Okay.  I think I got most of it.  Thanks Dvn2rckr...<br>
