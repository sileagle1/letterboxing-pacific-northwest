Thanks again for all that you did to make my trip so wonderful. I <br/>
can't tell you how great it was getting to know you and your kids.<br/>
<br/>
I uploaded some pictures and one of them is of those Zodiac clues we <br/>
found at the zoo. If you want to save that to your computer and let <br/>
me know you have a copy of it, I'll take it off the picturetrail <br/>
site so we don't potentially give it away. (Did that make sense?)<br/>

More later ... doing laundry and packing for FLA.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
