                    <div class="plaintext-content">(This is about the Molly Looking for Ginger Hitchhiker<br>
for those who may be confused)<br>
<br>
Today Brett and Ginger met Molly at the Vernonia Lake<br>
Letterbox. (Great stamp Chuck!) She and Ginger are<br>
having lots of fun. Molly plans to attend the Portland<br>
Summer gathering before heading back home.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, a family of first time<br>
letterboxers had just gotten to the letterbox when we<br>
walked up to the location! These lucky boxers got<br>
their first box, first hitchhiker, and first exchange<br>
all at once! I'll bet that hasn't happened many times<br>
before, if ever. It also made for my first exchange<br>
not at a gathering.<br>
<br>
FYI for all you PNW boxers - this new boxing family<br>
has already figured out my Bugle Mystery Box and plan<br>
to get this weekend. As far as I know, only Mark and<br>
Beth have gotten that one. All you other lazy boxers<br>
need to get on the ball! :)<br>
<br>
Thanks for the HH and entertainment, Chuck!<br>
<br>
PS for those wondering about the status of the Ginger<br>
looking for Molly HH, as of last week it was in New<br>
York somewhere waiting for a ride to Connecticut.<br>
