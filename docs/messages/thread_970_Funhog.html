They're not from us, but I wouldn't mind taking credit for them!  LOL  Last <br/>
year's stamp was beautiful!! (Haven't found the first one yet.)  I believe they <br/>
are from The Forest People.  Hopefully while they are out there planting the <br/>
Thanksgiving box they'll be inspired to plant a few more! :-)  <br/>

Hi, in reply to the below letter, I wanted to apologize if I upset <br/>
you in anyway with talking about your gender in the previous posting <br/>
I made. I hope all is ok. I certainly dont want to tread on anyones <br/>
feet and I am sorry I didnt realize you like to remain "genderless", <br/>
most people aren't bothered by this so I didnt stop to think that you <br/>
might be, sorry. :o/ *hugs* *hugs*  :o)<br/>
