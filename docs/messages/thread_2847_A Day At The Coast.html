<br>
John and I went to the Coast for SOLV's Fall Beach Clean Up on <br>
Saturday and got a little letterboxing in while we were at it.  <br>
<br>
We tried for a few.  We think Fishing Rock might have gotten "cleaned <br>
up" during the event, as we think we were in the right place and <br>
there were rocks and tree duff, but no box where we looked.  Fogarty <br>
Creek Treasures of the Sea #1 is no longer there, but there certainly <br>
is a big ammo box geocache with nothing much to offer.  I looked <br>
later and found I already had this series in my logbook anyway.  We <br>
couldn't really look for Fogarty Flower as there was a big wedding <br>
reception going on in the pavillion and there was no way of getting <br>
around that.  We couldn't really blend in and look like guests as our <br>
attire was early beach clean up rather than evening formal.  Maybe <br>
next time.  It was dark by the time we sought out Tranquility in Taft <br>
and came away empty-handed on that one, as well.  It might be there, <br>
but the lack of light and abundance of blackberry brambles made us <br>
give up easily on that one.  <br>
<br>
We were successful at Chris the Crab @ Cape Foulweather (stamp is <br>
broken in two, but still completely stampable and box is not very <br>
well-hidden (I did the best I could to rehide).  We got Sailing the <br>
High Seas.  Delightful clues and the original stamp on the logbook <br>
looked like it was awesome!  Too bad some dork traded it for a Star <br>
Student storebought piece of crap (There is also a geocache in the <br>
same spot as this letterbox).  If it ever gets replaced with a new <br>
stamp like the old I will happily try for it again.  What a sweet <br>
piece of art!  Last but not least we were able to locate the Bella <br>
Beach LB.  Very clever hiding spot!  We would have come away without <br>
that one if it weren't for John, the very clever love of my life. <br>
<br>
In the future we will try to bag Ozzy's Box, Kernville, and Mossy <br>
Creek, but couldn't do it this time around because the timing and the <br>
tides weren't in our favor when we were over that way.  It's nice <br>
there are so many letterboxes to seek over this way these days. <br>
<br>
While in the vicinity I also carved and placed "Son of Devil's Punch <br>
Bowl: Ode to Rock 'n Roll".  Clues will be posted soon.<br>
<br>

How are Penny, Grace and Nicholas doing these days?  The past couple <br>
years I've been spending a lot more time kayaking than letterboxing so <br>
sorry I've been out of touch.  A couple of good friends are just <br>
discovering the sport and it has renewed my interest a little bit.  <br>
Maybe I'll become more active.  Lord knows I need to!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good for you Paisley for being part of the clean up crew! Good idea to combine with letterboxing (although I imagine the crowds were bigger in some areas). Someone asked me if letterboxes got "cleaned up" at such events and I said that most of the clean ups were on the beach, and boxes are generally not hidden that close to the water. I was disappointed to hear Fishing Rock was among the missing. We found it on Labor Day it was such a great find. I'm sure you were in the right place - it wasn't tricky. I don't know if there were finders between then and now, but we did carefully re-hide the 12 boxes we found (you probably saw our stamps as you went - Yiker, K4 and KuKu).<br>
<br>
Fogarty Creek Treasures of the Sea is surely missing; we also found the geocache. In addition, we found Fogarty's Flower, tossed near the geocache (out in the open). We thought it was the Treasures box at first. It was very strange to find it so far from it's home and so near where the other letterbox should have been. We followed the clues and hid it where we hoped was it's hiding spot (using the revised posted clues since the original tree is marked for removal).<br>
<br>
We found Chris the Crab in the open, and re-hid it using a bunch of bark and tree duff. The stamp was broken but it's such a great image. The owner wrote to say they'd try to replace it. We noticed a lot of non-letterboxers find this one (including the Park Ranger who wrote a note). Extra bonus, we saw a whale while there.<br>
<br>
We could not find Sailing the High Seas and we were SURE we were in the right spot. Later we found out the stamp had been replaced, so we weren't to disappointed to miss it but I'd sure like to know where we went wrong in looking! We also could not find Visit the Aquarium and neither could the last 4 finders. They had cleared out the underbrush so it was likely cleared out as well. The other obviously missing box was at Beverly Beach Duo Box #1. It was hidden in an area used by exploring children as well as partying teens. It was doomed. We found 2 of 4 stamps at Beverly. Allow plenty of time for these boxes if you go.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to another stamp near the Devil's Punch Bowl. The Daughter of Devil's Punch Bowl is hidden on one of my favorite all time trails (we've spent a lot of time at the Inn at Otter Crest and I used to walk that path when I worked over there... 25 years ago).<br>
<br>
Thanks for the informative e-mail, Paisley Orca. We saw your stamp in one of the letterboxes and it's a great signature stamp!  - Yiker<br>
