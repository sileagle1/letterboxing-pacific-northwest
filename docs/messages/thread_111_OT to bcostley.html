the Intel picnic at Cedar Ridge in Vernonia last Summer?  If you did, <br/>
my company, Party Outfitters, provided the interactive inflatable <br/>
games for the kids.  Just curious if you were there and what your <br/>
thoughts on the picnic were.  Our company lost the bid for this <br/>
year's picnic but we are trying to get in on next year's.<br/>
