boxes here, 3 were ones we placed so we went straight to them (in a <br/>
desperate act to avoid being stuck in traffic for 2 hours) and 1 was <br/>
one we'd found 2 years ago (along the path to another).  The others <br/>
were all situated fairly close to the same highway that loops around <br/>
Seattle.  With gas hovering around $2.25 a gallon we had to conserve <br/>
fuel and 'go for broke' in one fell swoop.  We'd been saving many of <br/>
these boxes for quite a while and finally had a break in work &amp; <br/>
medical situation to explore some more.  The sneaking part was <br/>
because I was supposed to work yesterday.  Thank goodness that fell <br/>
through at the last minute!  We got a chance to see Van Gogh before <br/>
he 'went' (go/went? poor attempt at humour) and to seek out some new <br/>
boxes.  Now, it's back to the 'boxless' daily grind for a while, <br/>
unfortunately...<br/>
