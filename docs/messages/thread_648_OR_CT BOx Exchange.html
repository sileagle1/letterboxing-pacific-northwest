<br>
Since many boxers never get the chance to see stamps from boxers on <br>
the opposite coast, Alafair and myself have exchanged letterboxes <br>
for a few months. <br>
<br>
My Oregon box has been planted near Beacon Falls, New Haven<br>
County, CT and Alafair's wonderful box is in Hoyt Arboretum near <br>
Portland, OR. Both letterboxes have hand-made logbooks. The <br>
beautiful stamp in Alafair's box will be a welcome addition to any <br>
logbook. <br>
<br>
The respective clues are in "What's New." We'd like to invite as <br>
many people as possible to come out and visit these boxes and share <br>
their stamps and good wishes before we send them back to their <br>
respective coasts for our friends there to enjoy. <br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
