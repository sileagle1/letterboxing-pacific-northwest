Illinois - Iowa - South Dakota - Montana - Washington - Oregon - California  <br/>

We will be on I-90 from South Dakota all the way to Washington, cutting  down <br/>
on 395 to Kennewick for the night. Cross over to Oregon and follow 84 to  <br/>
Portland and I-5 all the way down to Bybee Springs where my parents and  <br/>
grandparents live.<br/>
<br/>
Coming home we will go via Reno where Mrs. Hart's sister lives and I-80 all  <br/>
the way home.<br/>
<br/>
We have printed the clues for over 150 boxes in every state along the way,  <br/>
will be lucky to find a fraction of that number. Hoping for between 50 &amp; 100  <br/>
for the whole trip.<br/>

In Montana you can't go wrong looking for any of Judy's boxes.  Don &amp; Gwen have also planted not too far off the freeway, their box "On the Trail" will take you back to the Corp of Discovery days.  In northern Idaho Sondog's boxes are not to be missed.  We especially like the "Mullan Road" letterbox and it is not far off the freeway.  As far as Spokane goes, I'd head to an area with several boxes near by.  Finch Arboretum on the west side of town has several by Storm Crow and 2 placed by Pied Piper, all are excellent boxes.  The Flying Squirrel Squad has one not too far off the freeway, "The One that Got Away" and it is a nice walk besides.  My plant, "Riblet's Goddess", won't take too long to get to and the view is cool.  When you get to Cheney you could check out the several boxes at Turnbull Wildlife Refuge.  All Excellent. There's not alot until you get to Ritzville, there's a pretty cute drive-by by Wood Aug &amp; Kurious Jo once you get there.  Have a great trip!<br/>

I see on Mapquest it is about 3 1/2 hour drive to Portland from Kennewick  <br/>
and we have with about a dozen lb's in between.<br/>
<br/>
I think we could linger a couple of hours, we hope to find a handful of  <br/>
boxes in Portland as well -- perhaps a guided tour? LOL<br/>
<br/>
We are planning on eating at my favorite fast food restaurant of all time  <br/>
(Popeye's Chicken - mmm) in Troutdale . . . sorry I ramble.<br/>
<br/>
Late afternoon-ish maybe?? wont be to long because we want to make it to my  <br/>
parents house sometime on Monday and they are about 5 hours south of  Portland.<br/>

Oh, by then you'll be back in Burgerville territory.  You can get <br/>
Popeye's anytime but there aren't that many Burgervilles around the <br/>
world and by the time you're in Troutdale you'll be smack dab between 3 <br/>
