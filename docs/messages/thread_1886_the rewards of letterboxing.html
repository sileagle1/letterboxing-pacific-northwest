yippee, we had a wonderful experieince of checking on a newly planted<br/>
orphan box of ours in Palm Springs<br/>
yippee, <br/>
what a reward<br/>
4 new visitors in less than a month!!!!<br/>
much more activity there then here in Southwest BC,<br/>
our boxes here were planted months ago, <br/>
and still only one visitor (boo hoo)<br/>
alas I shall be thankful the boxes have not gone missing<br/>
transported Flying Hog HH to Palm Springs and it is now on it's way...<br/>
to who knows where<br/>
in it's place another HH was left<br/>
<br/>
well my younguns were incredibly pleased to see so much response<br/>
after so many failed attempts of letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
my wonderful husband also enjoys this sport and adds a different<br/>
dimension each time...<br/>
he took photos of the HH for me to send off to the original owner<br/>
(didnt bring the HH back here as teh request was to have it travel<br/>
eastward in the US and..<br/>
considering Flying Pig HH sat idle for 2 years here in Canada,<br/>
didnt want that to happen again<br/>
blessings to you all<br/>
thanks again for intorducing us to this wonderful sport<br/>
