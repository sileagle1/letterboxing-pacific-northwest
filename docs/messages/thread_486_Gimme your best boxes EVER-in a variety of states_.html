(?), NM, north TX, OK, AR, MO, and AL. Whew! While this little <br/>
adventure is still 6 months away it's never too early to plan when <br/>
your anal-retentive, so I'd like your wealth of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
My DH has agreed to 1 letterbox a day, which means roughly 1 per <br/>
state (CA will be northern and southern.) So hit me with your not-to-<br/>
be-missed boxes in any applicable, or nearby, state on our route. I <br/>
plan to steer our course through interesting boxes, so if say CO has <br/>
one we just HAVE to get, I could change our route a little. <br/>
<br/>
I'd post this on the main list but it's just TOO big.<br/>
