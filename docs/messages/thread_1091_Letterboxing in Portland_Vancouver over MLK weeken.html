                    <div class="plaintext-content">WooHoo...Got to meet up with SleepyWhippet and Bookworm at the Dog <br>
Show on Monday. Exchanged stamps and I gave them a couple letterboxes <br>
to place for me and a Hitchhiker to launch somewhere down there for <br>
me. <br>
<br>
Found "Smith and Bybee" in great shape and after a little logistical <br>
research found the Equus Mystery Box. It does require some <br>
forethought and research but it is actually easy to find/get once you <br>
got that all done!! I was in and out in about 5 minutes flat!! <br>
<br>
I forgot the clues to all the letterboxes I wanted to hunt down but <br>
the dog show took up more time than anticpated after all. In doing <br>
all the running around for dog club related activities I have become <br>
familiar with where some of the other local boxes are: Reed College, <br>
Oregon City, Escatada and of course all those out on the Sunset <br>
Highway!<br>
<br>
I can't wait til summer's longer days are here! My letterboxing buddy <br>
and our collective kids plan on making a day trip or two down there <br>
for a day's worth of boxing!! WooHoo!!<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to meet up with me Kris and Rinda!<br>
<br>
Til later,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are glad you located the Equus!  We checked on it Saturday A.M. just to be sure it was in place for your visit.  We don't like to disappoint.  Sounds like you did well at the show.  Congrats for your accomplishments!  Our dog was good at agility but too wired to compete.  Now she has settled down but has problems, she cannot even go on most of our hikes.  <br>
