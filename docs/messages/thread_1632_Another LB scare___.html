We hightailed it out of there (2 little kids towed by Mom's <br/>

another interesting 'experience' along our letterboxing adventure!!!<br/>

<br/>
Hmm....  Haven't heard about the drug users using those restrooms <br/>
before.  Might be interesting to check out.  =)  (As long as I don't <br/>
have any little kids around....)<br/>
<br/>
I heard on the news that sometimes those restrooms open up, err, <br/>
unexpectedly while people are still on the pot.  The city claims it <br/>
was 'user error', but the people in it weren't too happy when the <br/>
door opened unexpectedly!<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll wait until they have all the bugs worked out before <br/>
using it.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; which by the way is still missing yes Ryan?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah....  I don't get into Portland as often as I used to!  =(<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We got asked if we wanted to purchase marijuana once, ran into<br/>
&gt; people smoking pot twice and ended up in a place that seemed to be<br/>
&gt; a makeshift homeless bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I love that city.  I miss Portland.  =)  Though the worst I've <br/>
had happen to me is some homeless-looking person begging and pledging <br/>
for a cigarette from me--they'd even pay a few bucks for it, they <br/>
said.  Didn't seem to believe me when I told them I didn't smoke and <br/>
didn't have cigarettes, but I considered that I should start carrying <br/>
them around town after that.  Might make a good profit.  =)<br/>
