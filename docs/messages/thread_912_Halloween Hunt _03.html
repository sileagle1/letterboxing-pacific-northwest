PNWLB Fright Fest '03.  We planned to go letterboxing but the <br>
weather didn't cooperate.  So we decided to go today.  We met at <br>
Pittock Mansion and discovered we had a on the spot gathering going <br>
on.  Pandora, Iron Bear, Wingnut, Emily, Transplanted Cowboys, <br>
Bookworm and See Shore all showed up.  Pandora even carved an event <br>
stamp for this mini gathering. I also got Transplanted Cowboy's <br>
Traveler - just ask them if you can see their brand (as in livestock <br>
brand)<br>
<br>
After everybody stampd in we all headed out to gather boxes.  We <br>
gave up on Sleight and we figured we had the clues Sleight'ly wrong <br>
and weren't getting very far.<br>
<br>
Seeing as how I had a meeting at church I had to get to I knew I <br>
needed to head back to Estacada at a decent time.  Bookworm, See <br>
Shore and I decided to get some of the Hoyt area stamps.  Yeah right <br>
with Veterans day upon us the place was jammed and driving a big 4wd <br>
f250 isn't conducive to parking in tight places.<br>
<br>
We gave up and decided to head to Clackamas Community College and <br>
see what we could find.<br>
<br>
First was to take See Shore to find the Oregon Trail box - the box <br>
has been smashed and has many holes in it.  Not wanting to leave it <br>
vulnerable in the wet weather and with people stamping in from so <br>
long ago that log book is a piece of history itself. Lots of people <br>
stamped that it was their first box to be found.  We triple baged it <br>
and hid it back carefully - can't see it even without foilage around <br>
it.<br>
<br>
Second was the 'department of redundancy department' in fine form if <br>
I do say so, fine form indeed.<br>
<br>
On to CCC where we found the 'duck pond' series.  Wow were those <br>
ducks (and one chicken) friendly - they were following us down the <br>
trails begging for food.  We were forced to surrender a few precious <br>
cinnamon chip cookies to them.  Mallards taking cookie pieces from <br>
my hand - scarey!<br>
<br>
We then found Perseus in great shape - a little wet inside but we <br>
dried it out and nothing inside the sealed baggie was damp! The tree <br>
has been cut down that is in the clues but the clues still tel you <br>
where the box is.  We could see the box plainly when we got to the <br>
area and hid it better when we left.<br>
<br>
onward to the Boxed Set.  We had fun with the challenging clues and <br>
finaly decided that this LB'ing from the car was great fun - did <br>
that series in record time!  Had to the sun was going down and I had <br>
a meeting to get to.<br>
<br>
I made it to my meeting with 7 minutes to spare - wow!  <br>
<br>
So glad we all got together today!  What a great time.  <br>
<br>
When can we do it again??  I haven't hunted in Vancouver area yet - <br>
when and where do we meet ?? :)<br>
<br>
Thanks all for the great time - great to see people I recognize from <br>
the Fright Fest 03!<br>
