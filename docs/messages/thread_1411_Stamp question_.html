I've carved 3 stamps so far but haven't really come up with our true "signature stamp."  I hope to become creative enough at carving that I can create a masterpiece like many many of the ones we've seen.  But until then, I just use our normal stamp.<br/>

Each of the kids have their own stamps, but if they're not attending to<br/>
what's going on, they don't stamp in. A lot of the time it's more about the<br/>
hike and the find for them than the stamp, so I don't push it.<br/>

  We started with a stamp for the whole family. Since then we each have our<br/>
  own stamp, but you are right it is time consuming stamping in with 3 or<br/>
more<br/>
  stamps. We use our family stamp when we are all together and time is<br/>
short,<br/>
  otherwise we still stamp in individually. Even our family stamp has<br/>
