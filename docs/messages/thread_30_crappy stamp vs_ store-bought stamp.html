Flaming Geyser is NOT a crappy stamp.  It's cute.  And, certainly, the stamp is better than the actual flaming geyser itself.  HA! HA!  <br/>
<br/>
I must confess, myself.  Any CARVED stamp is far superior to something store bought.  I know it sounds dumb, but when I came across a store-bought stamp in a letterbox the first time I was profoudly disappointed.  You'd think a stamp is a stamp, but it isn't.  Hand-carved is just very special, and in my opinion more appropriate for the sport of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
