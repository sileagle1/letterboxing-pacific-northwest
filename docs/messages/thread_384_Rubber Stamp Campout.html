<br/>
I've been kind of out of the list-serve loop for a while and I <br/>
wasn't sure if we were supposed to tell Amanda if we are coming or <br/>
not, but Barry and I are planning on coming to the campout next <br/>
weekend--definitely for one night (hopefully both).  Is there any <br/>
sort of list to see who is coming?  I would love to know who I could <br/>
look forward to meeting!!!  <br/>
<br/>
