weeks -- seems the hotel in question likes to switch around the hole <br/>
numbers.  But the box is there and the clue updated.  Just keep in <br/>
mind, find Jerry's face and you should be able to find the box, <br/>
regardless of the hole number.<br/>
<br/>
Also keep in mind, the hotel in question likes outdoor concerts.  <br/>
Lotsa people around.  Might want to avoid the grounds during such <br/>
concerts.  Especially considering, there is temporarily a big ol <br/>
spotlight nearly on top of Jerry.  Hint!<br/>
