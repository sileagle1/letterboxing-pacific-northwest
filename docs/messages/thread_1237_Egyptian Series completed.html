They are located in Vancouver, Washington, so you might try just <br>
looking under the SW Washington area on the map.  I'm not sure why <br>
they aren't coming up for you.  When I put in "Egypt" it comes up for <br>
me.  Let me know if you are still having trouble and I'll send you <br>
the clues off line.<br>
