<br>
We are fairly new to this group, but have had the priviledge of <br>
meeting a couple of you at the Corvallis meet back in October.  We <br>
will be travelling from the Eugene area up I-5 to Portland next month <br>
for barlowgirl's birthday and were wondering if there were any <br>
particularly wonderful boxes that were also easily acessible along the <br>
way. We want to take a little bit of time on the way up to hunt some <br>
(maybe half the day???) and since it's for her birthday, barlowgirl <br>
says "best of the best, please".  Anyone have any input?  We <br>
appreciate it.  This will be the first time we've hunted since last <br>
summer and we are so excited!<br>
<br>

*who wishes she had enough time to hunt all of Murray7's boxes...wow, <br>
that one's a planter isn't she?*<br>
<br>
p.s.  we wouldn't mind going a little off I-5 for a really great box, <br>
but we do have a loose schedule to keep to. thanks.<br>
<br>
