into CAnada and I don't think that they asked me for any ID.  But maybe that<br>
was because we crossed at 3am. <g>  Anyway, Getting back into the US took<br>
longer... I haven't evern been search.  I just had my birth certificate and<br>
Naturalization papers and my SSN.  I don't think that they really even<br>
wanted to see them  but better safe than, not able to get home... :-)<br>
