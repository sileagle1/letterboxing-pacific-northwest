enthused, and going to give his wife a letterboxing kit (complete <br/>
with hand-carved stamp) for Christmas.  What could be a nicer <br/>
present????<br/>

He mentioned that he saw a Letterboxing Class in the Olympia Parks <br/>
and Rec catalog.  Here is the info from their catalog on their <br/>

Quest Northwest: A Letterbox Adventure Ages: 7 and up<br/>
Are you a detective? A spy? A code-cracker? Can you solve a mystery? <br/>
Come join us in the<br/>
great outdoors and learn about letterboxing, the international sport <br/>
for adventures. Carve a<br/>
stamp to leave your mark, write clues for others to follow, crack <br/>
codes left by other explorers<br/>
and find the perfect hiding spot. This class will introduce kids and <br/>
adults to the increasingly popular<br/>
adventure of "questing." Remember, anyone can find Tupperware in the <br/>
kitchen, not everyone can find<br/>
it in the wild! Instructors: Kristine Sogn and Eileen Yoshina.<br/>
<br/>
This is on the Adult page of their Winter/Spring activities brochure, <br/>
at http://www.ci.olympia.wa.us/par/rec/winter_spring/Adult.pdf<br/>
Up two levels bring you to Olympia Parks, Arts, and Recreation.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has more details, please let everyone know.<br/>
