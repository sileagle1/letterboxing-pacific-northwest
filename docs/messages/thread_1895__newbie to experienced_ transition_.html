&gt; Question for the group:<br/>
&gt; When does a letterboxer advance from newbie to experienced?<br/>
<br/>
Who knows? After 2-1/2 years of letterboxing, some 900+ finds, some<br/>
190+ planted, etc, we still learn something new EVERY time we're out<br/>
there! Then, that learning curve increases EXPONENTIALLY at every<br/>
gathering we're able to attend! It's incredible what remains<br/>
undiscovered about this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
HISTORY:<br/>
<br/>
First, the history of it (Dartmoor &amp; US) is rather intriguing in<br/>
itself--even just the fact that just a few folks interested in the<br/>
Apr 98 Smithsonian Mag article have been able to create such a<br/>
letterboxing phenomenon in this country is incredible!<br/>
<br/>
MECHANICS OF FINDING A LETTERBOX:<br/>
<br/>
Then, the mechanics of letterboxing itself--from orienteering (which<br/>
I do for a living with my job--and I still learn something new<br/>
while letterboxing), to following directions, to deciphering clues,<br/>
to actually finding &amp; carefully replanting/recamouflaging well<br/>
hidden items in the woods, to learning some history and visiting a<br/>
place you otherwise would never know about had it not been for<br/>
somebody else participating in the hobby and planting a letterbox<br/>
out there to seek out. Anybody familiar with the LBNA FAQs or a<br/>
similar letterboxing Code of Conduct out there?<br/>
<br/>
MECHANICS OF PLANTING A LETTERBOX:<br/>
<br/>
Creating a unique letterbox--which includes a neat stamp (I<br/>
personally prefer handcarved to storebought but I don't care<br/>
how 'rustic' the handcarved ones are--I treasure the 'effort &amp; time'<br/>
somebody invests into the project over the final product), a great<br/>
clue (love it when history is woven into the clue or the verbage is<br/>
able to teach something new, regardless of subject, to the finder)<br/>
and a visit to either a beautiful or historically rich area. We<br/>
even love 'kitschy' type places. Just find a unique venue in which<br/>
to plant the letterbox. How many folks out there aren't aware that<br/>
the little 'bulb' end of the Speedball carving tool actually comes<br/>
off so you can store your carving nibs within? What containers do<br/>
you use--tupperware, rubbermaid, vhs cassette cases, altoid tins,<br/>
film canisters, magnets, velcro, baby sock christmas ornaments, fake<br/>
book, puzzle boxes in a cafe? Do you use pre-made notebooks, hand-<br/>
crafted logbooks, scrolls, hand-bound fabric covered books, etc to<br/>
include in your boxes?<br/>
<br/>
MECHANICS OF CLUE WRITING:<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes in clues, less is more. Other times more is better. Just<br/>
create something interesting &amp; unique. Puzzles, cryptogram,<br/>
anagrams, foreign language, substition style codes--word stories<br/>
with clue bits hidden within, etc--something fun &amp; informative<br/>
always does well. Photographs with no text, pictures with embedded<br/>
text--fake websites, GPS coordinates, the ideas are limitless. <br/>
Where do your ideas for writing clues come from? Newspaper articles, <br/>
historical society publications, bits of info found in 'fine print' <br/>
in museum displays,blurbs on trail kiosks, etc? Sometimes clue <br/>
distribution/location is a challenge and art all unto itself. Clues <br/>
to letterboxes are EVERYWHERE. Many clues are embedded in messages--<br/>
some are links to files, some hidden in photos/movies/lyrics to <br/>
songs, some show up in your postal box--you just never know. How do <br/>
you distribute clues to your boxes out there? Will it be a <br/>
straightforward clue or a mystery clue?<br/>
<br/>
MECHANICS OF STAMP CARVING:<br/>
<br/>
Where do you come up with your ideas for new, unique stamps? Clip<br/>
art, an idea that popped into your head, doodles on a restaurant<br/>
napkin, images you see on billboards/travel brochures/yahoo ads?<br/>
What carving medium do you use? School erasers, Mars carve,<br/>
speedball pink/white crumbly stuff, PZ Kut, dollar store erasers, 3-<br/>
D puzzle foam pieces, etc? How do you transfer the images?<br/>
Acetone, iron/heat transfer, pen/pencil transfer? What carving<br/>
tools do you use? Xacto knives, Speed ball linoleum carving tools,<br/>
scissors tips, hypodermic needle tips, wood carving tools, dremel<br/>
tools, dental tools, etc? How do you hold the tools, what do you<br/>
place the carving medium on, do you turn the medium or turn the tool<br/>
as you carve? What techniques do you use--Van Gogh-esque, Picasso-<br/>
esque, Edvard Muench-esque, Grandma Moses-esque, etc? Gouges,<br/>
straight lines, pecks, backhanded, cross hatching, shading, bevelled-<br/>
edges, feathered edging, etc? Lettering--free hand, newsprint<br/>
fonts, Old Gothic, wing-dings?<br/>
<br/>
I'd say there's always room for improvement. Probably to transition<br/>
from newbie to experienced would involve participating in at least<br/>
each 'facet' of letterboxing for a little bit--i.e. to find some<br/>
letterboxes, create &amp; plant some letterboxes of your own, meet some<br/>
fellow letterboxers for exchanges, solve/plant a few mystery boxes<br/>
in your area. I'm convinced that folks really must plant a<br/>
letterbox of their own to really 'appreciate' the work/effort that<br/>
goes into some of the other planted letterboxes out there. There's<br/>
just something about going through the process--logistically and<br/>
emotionally that really teaches folks to appreciate the treasures<br/>
they find planted by others out there. That whole 'letting go of<br/>
your child into the big, bad world' feeling one experiences when<br/>
they plant that first letterbox helps teach folks to truly<br/>
appreciate &amp; respect other boxes already out in the world. Only<br/>
then, will folks understand the 'anger/sadness' that planters<br/>
experience when beloved boxes go missing.<br/>
<br/>
So, what it boils down to is that there is no official 'threshold'<br/>
for the 'transition' from newbie to experienced boxer out there but<br/>
rather it's just sort of an evolution as folks are exposed to new &amp;<br/>
different things about the hobby along the way. Believe me, there's<br/>
always something else out there to be 'discovered'. Then, add some<br/>
new inventions along the way--Postal Letterboxes, Hitchhikers,<br/>
Cooties with some of the older convetions such as Personal<br/>
Travellers-- there's always room to grow!!! As you can see, the<br/>
possibilities are limitless!!!<br/>
<br/>
Just be sure to slow down &amp; savor the experience along the way!<br/>
