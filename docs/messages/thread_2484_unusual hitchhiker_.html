My daughter is graduating high school next month and will be off to <br/>
college. I want to make a letterbox in honor of this big life event <br/>
but with a twist. <br/>
<br/>
Kristin wants little more than to be a world traveller -- during and <br/>
after her education. What do you think of a hitchhiker that, in <br/>
addition to a tradtional log book etc.., asks finders to send my <br/>
daughter a postcard from wherever the hitchhiker turns up? I think <br/>
she would get a big kick out of receiving cards from all over the <br/>
world while she's stuck studying for finals. <br/>
<br/>
Would this work? Starting the hitchhiker on a path that increases <br/>
its chances of traveling long distances is important to its <br/>
successs. Anyone have any suggestions on how to do that? <br/>

Every Nutt-Job-Crazy will have a new young college girl's address.<br/>
Worse yet, IT'S YOUR DAUGHTER.  You'd have to find a way to "hide" <br/>
her address (and/or yours), but that is a VERY, VERY, VERY cool <br/>
idea.  I'm curious to see what/how you do it :)  Keep us all posted.<br/>

One idea might be to send all the postcards to a PO Box that's set up near campus.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I once received a PLB that the logbook was a bunch of postcards. <br/>
You could send out the PLB, have the participants add a postcard <br/>
from their hometown or maybe somewhere that they have traveled, <br/>
stamp the postcard with their signature stamp and write up a little <br/>
blurb about their card, and send the PLB on to the next recipient. <br/>
That way, she will get a box full of postcards all at once?<br/>
