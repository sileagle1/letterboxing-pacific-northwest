for anyone who wants to come out to Fort Steilacoom tomorrow <br/>
afternoon...Lea and I will be making the circuit around the lake and <br/>
trying to get a whole bunch of letterboxes! We won't get there until <br/>
around 2pm or so (have to make a few stops between the airport and <br/>
there)and we'll be 'boxing for several hours. We'd love to see some <br/>
other letterboxers 'on the trail' as it were. Most of you already <br/>
know what I look like and I'll be carrying my backpack with all the <br/>
patches on it. Also, since I already have all the letterboxes from <br/>
Steilacoom already, I'll just be strolling around with Lea, trying <br/>
not to lead her astray. :-)<br/>
