                    <div class="plaintext-content">Myriad mea culpas to Dave from Beaverton who also attended the <br>
event. I meant to include his name with his sister's family in <br>
the 'roll up' & then forgot to add him.  As I'd met him at a couple <br>
previous gatherings, I didn't have his stamp in my log this time <br>
around.  I know there's another entire family who attended but I <br>
can't remember their trail names.  Hopefully, somebody else can <br>
chime in with folks I've omitted.  Again, thanks for coming & can't <br>
wait for the next big get together for letterboxing enthusiasts in <br>
the region.<br>
