weekend.  They were *so* thrilled to hear from you<br>
all.  And I can't wait to tell them tomorrow AM about<br>
the HH that was (briefly) in one of their boxes.<br>
<br>
I've been reading this list for awhile, but this is my<br>
first message.  Miss Kitty, Snuggle Bunny, Tractor<br>
Boy, and I are very much enjoying our new hobby (we<br>
started in September).  I have a feeling that we're<br>
very fortunate to love in a area with so much<br>
activity.<br>
