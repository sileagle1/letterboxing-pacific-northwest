                    <div class="plaintext-content">well, as I posted at LBNA we have had the last in our series<br/>
sabatoged. The stamp went missing. (The Tempter) At least with this<br/>
one, we found  the box and book intact on the ground.<br/>
grrr, this one was one you could not have found without the clues,<br/>
that is unless, as I said you were a rat, weasel, or mouse. hmmm.<br/>
So we will repair it, then decide what to do, since it seems someone<br/>
has deliberately taken all of the letterboxes from this series.<br/>
take care all. Hopefully these pirates aren't lurking in your woods.<br/>

sorry Clio, <br/>
I didn't mean you, I actually meant a real rodent too start, then<br/>
realized that the 'rat' terminology and weasel would have fit.<br/>
Sorry, do you forgive me?<br/>
besides all the mice we have around here are pretty cute.<br/>
but seriously, for where the box was hid, in the small(very small<br/>
crevice along the side of a burned out nurse tree...<br/>

Do people really crawl around in the woods, peeking into stumps?  I can imagine some children get curious, but so many boxes gone......who finds them???<br/>
<br/>
  And if there IS a person out there whose purpose is to sabatoge letterboxes, I say "Get a hobby!!"  I mean, what kind of a life is that???<br/>
