I bet you expect us to put out a 'few' more boxes for you all to find, so<br>
you won't change your mind and leave :-)<br>
<br>
We will see what we can do for you.  I have a few ready to go, now to find<br>
the time and weather.<br>
<br>
It probably also means we will have to change the topic of the Early Summer<br>
WA SS LB QF to something other than a going-away party, saving that for the<br>
Fall WA SS LB QF.<br>

We just found out we'll be in the PNW for a bit longer.  Now, we <br>
won't be moving until Nov or Dec.  Just enough time to hit every <br>
single park in the state of WA!  Perhaps we'll have time left over <br>
for OR and ID, too!  ;)<br>
<br>
Hooray!!!<br>
