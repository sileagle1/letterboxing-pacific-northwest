  My mother, Purple Iris is currently cruising the Columbia River on <br/>
the Queen of the West Paddle Wheel Boat and will be visiting me and <br/>
Cat's Meow in Battle Ground next weekend. I am planning a small <br/>
gathering on Sunday, May 16 at 11:00am in Lewisville Park at the <br/>
Evergreen picnic area. There is currently a fee of $2.00 a car to <br/>
enter the park. At the park you can find my Happy Postman Series and <br/>
Maiden's Three Blind Mice. In nearby Yacolt, my Lucia Falls, Moulton <br/>
Falls and Chelatchie Prairie Railroad boxes as well as letterboxes at <br/>
Battle Ground Lake. Der Mad Stampers' Marshall Lookout and my new <br/>
Spring Bouquet Series. This is a great opportunity to add 16 finds <br/>
and a few exchanges to your log books! Please email me off list if <br/>
you are planning on attending or need directions to the park. Hope to <br/>
see you there!<br/>
