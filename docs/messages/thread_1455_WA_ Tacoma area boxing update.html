check up on a few of our boxes around town.<br>
<br>
We updated clues or replanted the following boxes:<br>
<br>
Sea Otter<br>
Musk Ox of the Defiant Animal Mystery Series<br>
Polar Bear<br>
<br>
Please ensure you have the current clues before you seek these out.<br>
<br>
In and around the chaos, we planted Grizzly Bear Breakout.<br>
<br>
We also visited MiniBully Mom's Pt Pagoda and it was doing very well.<br>
