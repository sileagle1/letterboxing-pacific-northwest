                    <div class="plaintext-content">I remember way back when...Rattlesnake Ledge was the ONLY letterbox up<br/>
in Northwestern Washington.  (I sound so old, don't I?)   So, remember,<br/>
the supposedly "Good Old Days" ain't always so good compared to now when<br/>
you have lots of great letterboxes up there to choose from.  <br/>
<br/>
Trial and Error and Evil Glenn got the ball rolling up there.  No matter<br/>
what folks may think of them, I'm thankful they came along and got<br/>
things underway in the Tacoma area. Then Amanda from Seattle came on the<br/>
scene and things really picked up.  And all who have come along since.<br/>
Thanks so much for making Washington such an excellent letterboxing<br/>
state just a few years later.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
