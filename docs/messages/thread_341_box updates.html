                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,<br/>
  My kids and I traveled to Idaho Falls, ID last week and had alot of <br/>
LD fun along the way. I am happy to report "Let'er Buck" is Alive and <br/>
Well. It had to go to lunch with us though. Some people decided to <br/>
sit right next to the hiding spot after we finished stamping in. I <br/>
think it enjoied the company though because we were only the 2nd to <br/>
stamp in. Great place to stop and go for a little stroll and work out <br/>
the sore behind from the drive.<br/>
  Second box was "Welcome to Idaho" It is also alive and well. We <br/>
were the first to find that one. One of the cleanest rest stops I <br/>
have ever been to. <br/>
  Third stop was the "birds of prey" LB in Boise. It too was alive <br/>
and well. We arrived to late to see the birds though. That was enough <br/>
for one day so we headed to the motel to swim and get pizza. <br/>
  Bright and early the next morning we traveled to Star, ID to visit <br/>
a fun litte hometown waterhole on the river. The kids had great fun <br/>
exploring under the bridge. Then we were on our way to Idaho Falls. <br/>
We stopped on the way at Craters of the Moon to explore the lava <br/>
tube. It was a GRAND ADVENTURE for all of us. We also left a few LB <br/>
friends behind. (look for clues in the near future)<br/>
  After a busy weekend at my sister-in -laws wedding we were off <br/>
hunting again today. Found "the Spirit of the West" alive and well. <br/>
Several geocachers had logged in also. We also hid the "Idaho Falls <br/>
LB" near by.(clues to be posted soon) <br/>
  Well now I must go to bed. Getting up early and heading to Jackson <br/>
Hole and will search for several more boxes. I am taking my in-laws <br/>
with and hope to get them interested.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently, we had an Arizona boxer, AZ Roadie, touring<br/>
our beautiful Pacific Northwest and snagging boxes at <br/>
a rate that even rivals Charlie Trailduster. He sent me <br/>
the link to his found list web page:<br/>
http://home.att.net/~azroadie/boxesfound04.html <br/>
I got his permission to post this link so that we can <br/>
check up on which boxes he found and on what dates. <br/>
I always like to have these updates so that I can keep <br/>
my boxes current on the LbNA site and thought others <br/>
would like to have the information as well. Funhog<br/>
