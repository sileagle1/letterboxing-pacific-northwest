I went out in search of a wonderful LB yesterday, like we all do on <br>
the days we skip work and call in sick. (cough-hack-achem!) *wink* <br>
But this time was a new adventure, we encountered 2 black bears along <br>
the way ON THE TRAIL. Ironically, the night before departure I was <br>
reading "Letterboxing info safety articles" and it mentioned what to <br>
do when you come along a bear on the trail. If its a grizzly, well <br>
your screwed, but with black bears it said to yell and roar and <br>
be "bigger" than the bear to scare it away, and what helpful <br>
information that was! One of these furry teddy bears was so close to <br>
me I could have hugged him and pinched his cheeks, and of course our <br>
two trail dogs walked right past it and didnt even notice it!! (I'm <br>
trading them in for new ones tomorrow)So I yelled and roared and <br>
scared all the wild life away and waved my arms (and still the dogs <br>
did nothing) but it scared away the bear, and a very short distance <br>
down the trail there was another bear which the dogs did chase away <br>
(finally!) but we called them back. So moral of the story, if you see <br>
a black bear on your trails, be bigger than it is and dont run away <br>
from it, you have to be the dominant one. (and once it is well gone, <br>
then you can run away in fear). We were in southern oregon in the <br>
Wild and Scenic Rogue Wilderness, prime bear country, but they are in <br>
lots of other places too! So just keep it in mind when your out there <br>
hiking, usually dogs (unless you have mine) will scare them away. Be <br>
careful out on the trails, letterboxers are an endangered species <br>
too, lets not get any killed.  :o) <br>

We saw a Momma Bear and cub on the Olympic Peninsula about a year & <br>
a half ago.  Fortunately, it was a good experience as we didn't <br>
separate Momma from cub!  What I'm probably more afraid of are <br>
cougars--I have my kids wear "bear bells" when we trek out in places <br>
known for wildlife (of course, the cougars may just think the noise <br>
is their 'dinner bell' ringing?).  The bells also came in handy when <br>
we went spelunking for a letterbox, too.  I can't imagine it would <br>
have been much fun losing a 2 year old in a cave.  ;)<br>

Do you know how to tell a black bear from a grizzlie??<br>
<br>
The black bear will chase you up the tree and the Grizzlie will just knock<br>
it down!!! <g><br>

My guess wasnt too far off! The black bears are the ones that run <br>
from you (usually)and the grizzles are the ones that will shred you <br>
(and your doggy) in to itty bitty pieces. And that is why I dont LB <br>
in grizzly country :o) I am alot less worried about a cougar than a <br>
grizzly though, they tend to be alot more elusive. I guess if I ever <br>
come across one, since I dont carry a gun, I'll just have to throw my <br>
biggest and heaviest stamp at his head and run like hell! Congrats <br>
Amy on your dogs placement :o)  Mine is just a mutt, golden retriever <br>
and bull mastiff mix, but if he wasn't free (got him out of an add) <br>
for a dog like him I would have paid top-dollar purebred price. He <br>
couldnt be a more wonderful dog and to make matters even better, him <br>
and my boyfriend both share the same name hahaha  I still cant <br>
believe he walked right past that bear on the trail without seeing it <br>
though, he was too busy playing with the other dog.   :o)<br>
