I carved what I would like to think as my best 2 stamps to date and <br>
am going nuts trying to find a place to plant them!! I want to do it <br>
close to home and along the rogue river but all the places I can <br>
think of with that description, I have already put LB's there and I <br>
dont want to put them in the same place as other ones... oohh what a <br>
crisis woe is me. A little to chilly for really long hikes too, but I <br>
dont want them to be "Driveby" LB's so I guess I will just have to do <br>
some searching of new places I havent been to yet, oh that will be <br>
horrible *grin* I hate hiking :oP  I think my dog is getting just as <br>
anxious as me to get out and do some hiking, especially before it <br>
gets too much colder. (Leave it to a woman to complain that life is <br>
good)haha  :o)<br>

There is a really neat old cabin at Whiskey Creek just down river <br>
from Rainey Falls. It is on river right just off the trail.<br>

Don: As always, thanks for the info :o) Have you ever hiked from the <br>
top of the canyon down to the cabin? aacck! thought I was gonna die! <br>
and it was only like a mile or so. Usually people acess it from the <br>
river. I do know about the whiskey creek cabin, neat lil ol place :o) <br>
my LB sidekick Sandi is married to a firefighter and him and his <br>
partner are usually stationed just a little over a 1/4 mile upstream <br>
of that cabin for fire lookout during the summer. Its not a very <br>
comfy camping spot, mosquito infested and rocks abound, (especially <br>
under sleeping bags) unless you have a hammock with a net over it, <br>
you dont want to sleep there, but thank goodness for all of us that <br>
those wonderful firemen endure it all summer long to keep watch on <br>
our forests. I have not yet placed an LB there because Sandi wanted <br>
too and thought of it before I did, so I will leave it up to her (but <br>
at this rate someone may do it before us haha) :o) So far I have <br>
placed most of the LB's, now its her turn. We are actually planning <br>
several drive-bys in Galice Oregon, I think there will be 5 in total, <br>
which should be out there in the next few weeks hopefully :o) We <br>
thought it would be nice for those incapable of hiking or just for <br>
those who dont want to be out in the cold too long in winter. <br>
