To answer a couple of questions:<br>
<br>
1) Silver Falls is 26 miles east of Salem. URL: <br>
http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_211.php<br>
<br>
2) RVs: not allowed in group camp, there may be regular RV spots <br>
available, check the website listed above for reservations<br>
<br>
3) Sunday camping: there is some interest for Sunday camping and the <br>
groups sites are available as of now. If enough folks want Sunday <br>
night camping and someone is willing to reserve, we can add Sunday <br>
night.<br>
<br>
4) I've tracked responses so far, I'll keep this list as current as <br>
I can. Please review and send me any changes necessary or let me <br>
know if I left you out or you need to be added. <br>

'No camp' means you are planning to come but aren't camping at the <br>
group camp.<br>

Amanda and I would like to go, but I'm not sure we can commit to<br>
"definitely" being there as of yet.  Mostly it depends on if her<br>
airline stays in business.  If not, who knows where we'll end up or<br>
what we'll be doing?<br>
<br>
If we do make it, though, we certainly won't be taking more than one<br>
car and one tent.  (Or maybe a tarp instead?)  If we carpool with<br>
someone else who's already going, we might even be able to ditch the<br>
car.  =)  (We'll still have a tent or tarp, however.)<br>

awful silly for us to camp and take a spot that an out of Towner or someone<br>
not so local to the Park could use when we can just do a day trip, so<br>
probably count us in for being there and not camping. -- If we could get<br>
some details as time draws closer about what time we might want to show up<br>
for the day and what to expect as far as boxes and any workshops or anything<br>
anyone might be doing that would be really cool.<br>
