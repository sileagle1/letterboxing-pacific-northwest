Hi everyone!<br/>
 Sandi and I have been throwing around an idea for a new letterbox <br/>
for about a week now. We are very fortunate to live right next to an <br/>
utterley amazing, wonderful, meaningful, fantastic wildlife <br/>
rehabilitation and education center. For example, when someone hits a <br/>
wild animal driving down the road, you can scoop the injured animal <br/>
and take it to this place for help in recovering, and/or you can call <br/>
this place and have them pick up the animal that is injured. After <br/>
the injured animal is healed, they are relocated and released into <br/>
the wild. Unfortunately there are some animals that have come to this <br/>
place, such as a grizzly bear, a kodiak, several black bears, <br/>
cougars, lynx, foxes, and other animals that will never leave, this <br/>
is their permanent home because they were domesticated as cubs (made <br/>
to be pets that grew to big) or were injured so severely that they <br/>
can never be released back into the wild, like an eagle whose beak <br/>
was ripped off and a wing in a car accident. These animals are not <br/>
like zoo animals, they actually try to give these animals as little <br/>
human influence as possible, to increase their survival in the wild. <br/>
<br/>
The truly amazing part of all this is the fact that this entire <br/>
rehabilitation center is run 100% on donations of kind and caring <br/>
people, but as you can imagine, they never have enough funding and <br/>
are constantly struggling to make ends meet. Every single person <br/>
(with the exception of I think 3 people who are paid employees) is a <br/>
volunteer, and they can never have enough volunteers. Anyways, this <br/>
place gets a huge portion of its donations through free tours held <br/>
for the public. You can call them and make an appointment for you <br/>
free tour which consists of about an hour and a half and is easy <br/>
walking for kids and the elderly where you will meet a huge variety <br/>
of wonderful creatures, some you have never even seen or heard of :)<br/>
They also travel with some of the animals (the permanent residents) <br/>
and do educational tours at fairs and other events. Like I said, its <br/>
not anything like a zoo, you are not charged for entry fee, not <br/>
forced to donate, and their are no vendors other than a small gift <br/>
shop. If you only came here you would see what a wonderful place this <br/>
is. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways...the letterbox idea...Sandi and I want to create a very <br/>
artistic and wonderful letterbox in celebration of this rehab and <br/>
education center. We will post directions on how to find this place, <br/>
only 10 miles off of I-5, and instead of finding the hidden letterbox <br/>
you would go to the counter at the gift shop and ask for it. The only <br/>
catch is that you must donate $1 (or more if your feeling generous) <br/>
to be given the letterbox for stamping, afterwards it would be given <br/>
back to the employee to replace behind the counter. I very highly <br/>
reccomend taking a free tour while you are there also, it is best to <br/>
call in advance to schedule it. remember, the donation even if its <br/>
only $1 does make a difference to these animals. It is food money, <br/>
habitat money, veterinary/medical money. <br/>
<br/>
So my question is I guess, if Sandi and I were to go through with <br/>
this idea, would any of you actually participate in it? would this <br/>
attract any letterboxers (since its not hidden and therefore not much <br/>
of a treasurehunt)? Or are we waisting our time with this idea? We <br/>
certainly would not do this if we didnt think it was a worthwhile <br/>
cause, and I can guarantee this rehab center more than qualifies <br/>
as "worthwhile". So Please, if you can, send me an email or a posting <br/>
with your opinion on this idea. I really hope that you guys think its <br/>
a good idea. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time in reading this long posting.<br/>
Happy trails to all!<br/>

&gt; a worthwhile <br/>

&gt; you guys think its <br/>
&gt; a good idea. <br/>

I'd also participate. Hey, it's no different than paying a day use fee<br/>
at a park. I like the fact of the money going towards the animals. I<br/>
grew up in the Bay Area of California and was a frequent visitor to the<br/>
Marine Mammal Center and loved every minute of it.<br/>

  I say go for it.  I'd participate when I'm in the area.  A great cause<br/>
  and neat place to visit along with getting a letterbox.  Wow, a triple<br/>
  bonus.<br/>

  &gt;Hi everyone!<br/>
  &gt; Sandi and I have been throwing around an idea for a new letterbox<br/>
  &gt;for about a week now. We are very fortunate to live right next to an<br/>
  &gt;utterley amazing, wonderful, meaningful, fantastic wildlife<br/>
  &gt;rehabilitation and education center. For example, when someone hits a<br/>
  &gt;wild animal driving down the road, you can scoop the injured animal<br/>
  &gt;and take it to this place for help in recovering, and/or you can call<br/>
  &gt;this place and have them pick up the animal that is injured. After<br/>
  &gt;the injured animal is healed, they are relocated and released into<br/>
  &gt;the wild. Unfortunately there are some animals that have come to this<br/>
  &gt;place, such as a grizzly bear, a kodiak, several black bears,<br/>
  &gt;cougars, lynx, foxes, and other animals that will never leave, this<br/>
  &gt;is their permanent home because they were domesticated as cubs (made<br/>
  &gt;to be pets that grew to big) or were injured so severely that they<br/>
  &gt;can never be released back into the wild, like an eagle whose beak<br/>
  &gt;was ripped off and a wing in a car accident. These animals are not<br/>
  &gt;like zoo animals, they actually try to give these animals as little<br/>
  &gt;human influence as possible, to increase their survival in the wild.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;The truly amazing part of all this is the fact that this entire<br/>
  &gt;rehabilitation center is run 100% on donations of kind and caring<br/>
  &gt;people, but as you can imagine, they never have enough funding and<br/>
  &gt;are constantly struggling to make ends meet. Every single person<br/>
  &gt;(with the exception of I think 3 people who are paid employees) is a<br/>
  &gt;volunteer, and they can never have enough volunteers. Anyways, this<br/>
  &gt;place gets a huge portion of its donations through free tours held<br/>
  &gt;for the public. You can call them and make an appointment for you<br/>
  &gt;free tour which consists of about an hour and a half and is easy<br/>
  &gt;walking for kids and the elderly where you will meet a huge variety<br/>
  &gt;of wonderful creatures, some you have never even seen or heard of :)<br/>
  &gt;They also travel with some of the animals (the permanent residents)<br/>
  &gt;and do educational tours at fairs and other events. Like I said, its<br/>
  &gt;not anything like a zoo, you are not charged for entry fee, not<br/>
  &gt;forced to donate, and their are no vendors other than a small gift<br/>
  &gt;shop. If you only came here you would see what a wonderful place this<br/>
  &gt;is.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Anyways...the letterbox idea...Sandi and I want to create a very<br/>
  &gt;artistic and wonderful letterbox in celebration of this rehab and<br/>
  &gt;education center. We will post directions on how to find this place,<br/>
  &gt;only 10 miles off of I-5, and instead of finding the hidden letterbox<br/>
  &gt;you would go to the counter at the gift shop and ask for it. The only<br/>
  &gt;catch is that you must donate $1 (or more if your feeling generous)<br/>
  &gt;to be given the letterbox for stamping, afterwards it would be given<br/>
  &gt;back to the employee to replace behind the counter. I very highly<br/>
  &gt;reccomend taking a free tour while you are there also, it is best to<br/>
  &gt;call in advance to schedule it. remember, the donation even if its<br/>
  &gt;only $1 does make a difference to these animals. It is food money,<br/>
  &gt;habitat money, veterinary/medical money.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;So my question is I guess, if Sandi and I were to go through with<br/>
  &gt;this idea, would any of you actually participate in it? would this<br/>
  &gt;attract any letterboxers (since its not hidden and therefore not much<br/>
  &gt;of a treasurehunt)? Or are we waisting our time with this idea? We<br/>
  &gt;certainly would not do this if we didnt think it was a worthwhile<br/>
  &gt;cause, and I can guarantee this rehab center more than qualifies<br/>
  &gt;as "worthwhile". So Please, if you can, send me an email or a posting<br/>
  &gt;with your opinion on this idea. I really hope that you guys think its<br/>
  &gt;a good idea.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
