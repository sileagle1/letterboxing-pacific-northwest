Hi everyone!<br>
 Sandi and I have been throwing around an idea for a new letterbox <br>
for about a week now. We are very fortunate to live right next to an <br>
utterley amazing, wonderful, meaningful, fantastic wildlife <br>
rehabilitation and education center. For example, when someone hits a <br>
wild animal driving down the road, you can scoop the injured animal <br>
and take it to this place for help in recovering, and/or you can call <br>
this place and have them pick up the animal that is injured. After <br>
the injured animal is healed, they are relocated and released into <br>
the wild. Unfortunately there are some animals that have come to this <br>
place, such as a grizzly bear, a kodiak, several black bears, <br>
cougars, lynx, foxes, and other animals that will never leave, this <br>
is their permanent home because they were domesticated as cubs (made <br>
to be pets that grew to big) or were injured so severely that they <br>
can never be released back into the wild, like an eagle whose beak <br>
was ripped off and a wing in a car accident. These animals are not <br>
like zoo animals, they actually try to give these animals as little <br>
human influence as possible, to increase their survival in the wild. <br>
<br>
The truly amazing part of all this is the fact that this entire <br>
rehabilitation center is run 100% on donations of kind and caring <br>
people, but as you can imagine, they never have enough funding and <br>
are constantly struggling to make ends meet. Every single person <br>
(with the exception of I think 3 people who are paid employees) is a <br>
volunteer, and they can never have enough volunteers. Anyways, this <br>
place gets a huge portion of its donations through free tours held <br>
for the public. You can call them and make an appointment for you <br>
free tour which consists of about an hour and a half and is easy <br>
walking for kids and the elderly where you will meet a huge variety <br>
of wonderful creatures, some you have never even seen or heard of :)<br>
They also travel with some of the animals (the permanent residents) <br>
and do educational tours at fairs and other events. Like I said, its <br>
not anything like a zoo, you are not charged for entry fee, not <br>
forced to donate, and their are no vendors other than a small gift <br>
shop. If you only came here you would see what a wonderful place this <br>
is. <br>
<br>
Anyways...the letterbox idea...Sandi and I want to create a very <br>
artistic and wonderful letterbox in celebration of this rehab and <br>
education center. We will post directions on how to find this place, <br>
only 10 miles off of I-5, and instead of finding the hidden letterbox <br>
you would go to the counter at the gift shop and ask for it. The only <br>
catch is that you must donate $1 (or more if your feeling generous) <br>
to be given the letterbox for stamping, afterwards it would be given <br>
back to the employee to replace behind the counter. I very highly <br>
reccomend taking a free tour while you are there also, it is best to <br>
call in advance to schedule it. remember, the donation even if its <br>
only $1 does make a difference to these animals. It is food money, <br>
habitat money, veterinary/medical money. <br>
<br>
So my question is I guess, if Sandi and I were to go through with <br>
this idea, would any of you actually participate in it? would this <br>
attract any letterboxers (since its not hidden and therefore not much <br>
of a treasurehunt)? Or are we waisting our time with this idea? We <br>
certainly would not do this if we didnt think it was a worthwhile <br>
cause, and I can guarantee this rehab center more than qualifies <br>
as "worthwhile". So Please, if you can, send me an email or a posting <br>
with your opinion on this idea. I really hope that you guys think its <br>
a good idea. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your time in reading this long posting.<br>
Happy trails to all!<br>
Erfellie<br>

I'd also participate. Hey, it's no different than paying a day use fee<br>
at a park. I like the fact of the money going towards the animals. I<br>
grew up in the Bay Area of California and was a frequent visitor to the<br>
Marine Mammal Center and loved every minute of it.<br>

  I say go for it.  I'd participate when I'm in the area.  A great cause<br>
  and neat place to visit along with getting a letterbox.  Wow, a triple<br>
  bonus.<br>
