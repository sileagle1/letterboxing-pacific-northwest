Hey everyone :) Maybe if some of you letterboxers are bored you can <br/>
help me out by reading some clues I wrote. I am trying to take that <br/>
next step from beginner to experienced letterboxers (even though I<br/>
have been at it for almost 2 years) but most of my previously placed <br/>
letterboxes arent super creative, mostly a spiral bound pack of index <br/>
cards forthe logbook and very direct straightforward clues. So for<br/>
the last 2 days I have been in super duper creative mode (rainy days<br/>
do <br/>
that to me) so i was hoping that if anyone out there is bored enough<br/>
to read the stories I made up for my clues and throw out an opinion or<br/>
two with mayne constructive critisicm. They are on the LBNA site<br/>
under <br/>
these adresses below or if the links dont work, Oregon, Region 6, box <br/>
names Applegate trail and Myrtle the Turtle. Enjoy them :o) They are <br/>
supposed to be funny. <br/>

Oh Erfellie!<br/>
your clues are beautiful!!<br/>
I know exactly where you have Snowballs 'grave'.<br/>
lovely spot!!<br/>
a family favourite on our long road trips!<br/>
Your clues are so fitting for the setting!!!!<br/>
My daughter really enjoyed the clues too, she is 9 and knows the spot<br/>
recognized the Little House dialogue right away.<br/>
<br/>
wonderful wonderful job,<br/>
as for the other box, your clues are great, very creative, but since I<br/>
am unfamiliar with the spot can't picture it like I did the Applegate one.<br/>
<br/>
yup! I hereby nominate you to be moved up to the next level of<br/>
letterboxers and say you are no longer in the newbies category!(grin)<br/>

I just wanted to let you know that I really do appreciate your <br/>
comments, it was very nice of you, and flattering :) and makes me <br/>
eager to place more LBs. Myrtle the Turtle is easy to locate with the <br/>
directions even if you dont know the area, in fact my sister went and <br/>
found it today, and shes not always the best at locating boxes haha  <br/>
she did leave my "Ivan the inchworm" HH in there instead of taking it <br/>
with her, because we are sisters she didnt feel the need to take it, <br/>
but whoever finds it next is going to get a cute stamp and a super <br/>
cute inchworm HH !  :) Again, thanks for your wonderful comments, it <br/>
makes me really happy to know that you and your daughter enjoyed the <br/>
stories and I hope others will too :) <br/>
Erfellie <br/>
