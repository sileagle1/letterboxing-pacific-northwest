I caught myself a couple of newbie letterboxers out in West Seattle<br/>
yesterday which was kind of fun. They were looking for the Birthplace<br/>
of Seattle letterbox and I had already found that box nearly a near<br/>
before but happened to be passing the area on one of my long, rambling<br/>
walks and saw two people crawling around looking suspicious with a<br/>
piece of paper in their hands.<br/>
<br/>
They could have been geocachers, I suppose, so I checked them out for<br/>
a GPS and didn't see any. And when I got closer I saw the paper they<br/>
had with the block graphics of the curled parchment paper at the top<br/>
and knew the clue had to have come off of LbNA. I caught myself some<br/>
letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
They were having trouble finding the box--which didn't really surprise<br/>
me much because *I* had trouble finding the box the first time I was<br/>
out there, so I tried to help them out and contributed to the search.<br/>
I didn't remember which of those hundreds of nooks and crannies the<br/>
letterbox was located in, so they read me the clues and probably spent<br/>
a half hour trying to find that darned box. The other two--one was a<br/>
local and this was his first letterboxing outing. Didn't even have a<br/>
stamp to show for himself yet, while the other was from Boston and she<br/>
said she was pretty new to letterboxing as well, though this wasn't<br/>
her first box. They were just about to give up on the box before I<br/>
came to the rescue and found it. =)<br/>
<br/>
So they stamped in and I did an exchange with the girl (Susan, I think<br/>
it was?) who actually had a signature stamp. Just so happened that I<br/>
had my letterboxing gear in my daypack--I had never taken it out from<br/>
my last letterboxing outing. =) Didn't think I'd be using yesterday!<br/>
<br/>
But as the boy scouts say, always be prepared.....<br/>
<br/>
Then I continued my walk and they went off to find more letterboxes<br/>
around West Seattle.<br/>
