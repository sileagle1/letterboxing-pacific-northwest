I caught myself a couple of newbie letterboxers out in West Seattle<br>
yesterday which was kind of fun. They were looking for the Birthplace<br>
of Seattle letterbox and I had already found that box nearly a near<br>
before but happened to be passing the area on one of my long, rambling<br>
walks and saw two people crawling around looking suspicious with a<br>
piece of paper in their hands.<br>
<br>
They could have been geocachers, I suppose, so I checked them out for<br>
a GPS and didn't see any. And when I got closer I saw the paper they<br>
had with the block graphics of the curled parchment paper at the top<br>
and knew the clue had to have come off of LbNA. I caught myself some<br>
letterboxers!<br>
<br>
They were having trouble finding the box--which didn't really surprise<br>
me much because *I* had trouble finding the box the first time I was<br>
out there, so I tried to help them out and contributed to the search.<br>
I didn't remember which of those hundreds of nooks and crannies the<br>
letterbox was located in, so they read me the clues and probably spent<br>
a half hour trying to find that darned box. The other two--one was a<br>
local and this was his first letterboxing outing. Didn't even have a<br>
stamp to show for himself yet, while the other was from Boston and she<br>
said she was pretty new to letterboxing as well, though this wasn't<br>
her first box. They were just about to give up on the box before I<br>
came to the rescue and found it. =)<br>
<br>
So they stamped in and I did an exchange with the girl (Susan, I think<br>
it was?) who actually had a signature stamp. Just so happened that I<br>
had my letterboxing gear in my daypack--I had never taken it out from<br>
my last letterboxing outing. =) Didn't think I'd be using yesterday!<br>
<br>
But as the boy scouts say, always be prepared.....<br>
<br>
Then I continued my walk and they went off to find more letterboxes<br>
around West Seattle.<br>
