<br/>
I want to introduce my letterboxing family...we are (trail names) <br/>
Big Dog 1 (dad), Big Dog 2 (mom), Cat (daughter age 10) and Jolt <br/>
(son age 8 1/2).  We are pretty new to letterboxing (just started <br/>
Labor Day Weekend) but have already found 21 boxes plus one HH.  <br/>
Just bought some supplies to plant some of our own in the very near <br/>
future.  I have already found some pretty cool locations that are <br/>
untapped, too!  <br/>
<br/>
We live in the Olympia, WA area (which seems to be quite popular <br/>
from the last few posts that I have read).  I am a stay-at-<br/>
homeschooling mom that runs my own business.  Dad is a sod harvest <br/>
supervisor for a major sod distributor.  We moved to the Olympia <br/>
area 3 years ago from San Diego where DH worked for the San Diego <br/>
Wild Animal Park for almost 30 years; taking care of the numerous <br/>
animals.<br/>
<br/>
We currently use a store bought stamp that shows a family of <br/>
cooties.  It is a nice small stamp so that it won't take up a lot of <br/>
room in the log books. We learned about LBing from the one page <br/>
article that recently appeared in Time Magazine.  I have to say that <br/>
this has been one of the BEST hobbys that my family has been <br/>
involved in.<br/>
<br/>
DH's and my trail names came from the fact that we also have Great <br/>
Danes.  We will be pretty easy to spot if we happen to have them <br/>
along while we are LBing!  If any of you have seen the movie The <br/>
Patriot, with Mel Gibson, then you have already seen one of our <br/>
Danes.  The black one is our girl Miss Charity (long story on how <br/>
that happened and I won't bore you all with the details).<br/>
<br/>
Well, that is enough about us.  Thanks to dvn 2r ckr for inviting us <br/>
to join this group!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing,<br/>
The Cootie Family <br/>
