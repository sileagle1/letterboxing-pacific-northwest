letterbox clues were recently added.  I think they are<br>
the same ones that Amanda From Seattle had adopted<br>
so I guess the original owners have reclaimed them.<br>
Just wanted to let you know that I visited all three<br>
(and Amanda's two) in that park on 11/14/03 and they<br>
were alive and well.  Nice park, too!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yup, Thanks so much to the Seattle Muddle Puddle Trotters for <br>
claiming their letterbox clues. <br>
<br>
I have also had 2 groups of people from NC whose boxes I had adopted <br>
finally come forward and reclaim their clues! Mostly it was folks who <br>
had changed their email addresses from when they first started <br>
letterboxing and then had not been on the yahoo groups board to know <br>
about the whole changeover thing! <br>
 And one NC girl told me she was no longer interested in letterboxing <br>
and that I could just keep the clues up there and delete them if the <br>
boxes ever went missing.<br>
