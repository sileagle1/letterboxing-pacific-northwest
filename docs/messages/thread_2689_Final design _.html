Thanks for heading this up, Murray7.  It seems like a lot of work to <br>
me.  Great job though.  (btw, I got those books in the mail.  Thanks <br>
again.)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So glad you asked! The logo on the front pocket area will be almost<br>
exactly like Wildhair's patch that she submitted to the files a few<br>
weeks ago. The back will have the "wander" verse in a casual<br>
handwritten script with the sluggy slithering off the end (thanks to<br>
Funhog). The ink will be gold which goes nicely with all the t-shirt<br>
colors. <br>
<br>
It's really been a collaborative effort and I think the results will<br>
be great! I could post the art to the files section but I think maybe<br>
I'll keep you in suspense until the shirts get back from the printer.<br>
I've been thrilled to see how many people want shirts! We may get an<br>
additional discount because of the quantity. It has been a bit of<br>
work, but I love projects like this. Thanks, everyone, for your<br>
enthusiasm.<br>
