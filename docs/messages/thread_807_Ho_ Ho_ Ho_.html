                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, well, I really put my foot into it.  Good thing you can't get <br>
pictures of what I look like with both feet in my mouth at the same <br>
time.  =)<br>
<br>
First, I talk plenty about people (both good and bad, I might add)<br>
behind their backs, and I'd be surprised if I was the only one.  <br>
However, due to the poor user-interface on this talk list, I <br>
accidentally posted it public rather than e-mail, which is what I <br>
intended.  (It happens to everyone, eventually.)  E-mails of that <br>
content should never, ever be published publicly, and for that I <br>
truly do apologize.  I noticed my error immediately and deleted the <br>
post from the talk list within seceonds, but--unfortunately for me--I <br>
couldn't take it back from those that choose to get their posts via e-<br>
mail.  Even worse, you were one of them.  The stars, obviously, were <br>
not aligned for my well-being.<br>
<br>
But you should also understand, I hold ill feelings towards you.  <br>
What annoys me is your enthusiam for letterboxing.  In your quest to <br>
be helpful--a noble task where your thoughts are certainly in the <br>
right place--you tend to go overboard.  Like creating a letterboxing <br>
website as an "alternative" to the original (which I feel ends up <br>
fragmenting the original site if you succeed, but is probably a waste <br>
of your time since other attempts at "alternative" sites have <br>
essentially failed).  Rather than that, I wish you'd create a website <br>
that provided more information and how-to tutorials instead of trying <br>
to reinvent the wheel.<br>
<br>
You also tend to break 'Miss Janet's guidelines' about posting too <br>
often, although that doesn't really bother me much since I don't read <br>
most posts on this or the main letterboxing board.  Rather, it's just <br>
another example of "too much" enthusiam that, at times, gets under my <br>
skin.<br>
<br>
But if there's one good thing I can say about newbie enthusiasm, you <br>
guys are great at creating letterboxing gatherings.  I'm thrilled to <br>
death Bethany planned out last year's Steilacoom gathering.  And Sir <br>
B's SLO gathering.  And even your Fright Fest gathering, although I <br>
probably can't make it out to Tacoma in time for that.  You should <br>
have seen my pathetic attempt at organizing Seattle's first <br>
letterboxing gathering.  Puts me shame just to think about it.  Even <br>
worse, I was the last one to arrive for it!  What an embarrassment!<br>
<br>
And if it's any consolation--probably not, but I'll say it anyhow--<br>
I've also told others behind your back that I'd probably like you far <br>
more in person than I do the persona in your posts.  Ironic, huh?  Of <br>
course, that one I actually managed to send as e-mail.  *rolling eyes*<br>
<br>
Anyway....  there's a large following of anti-Ryan supporters out <br>
there--I have little doubt about that--and they'll probably be <br>
sending you an application to join their group soon.  If my apology <br>
won't suffice, they'll certainly welcome you with open arms!<br>

Then the recipent of the email chose to reply to it via this board! <br>
Encluding the offensive email in his reply!!<br>
<br>
So now all 97 people who belong to this board have read the first <br>
offensive email and the replies. Instead of about 12 people who get <br>
individual emails. <br>

If you don't want people to talk about it, then don't reply to it and <br>
don't post it on the board! I mean really, if you don't have any more <br>
computer savvy than that...<br>
