However, due to the poor user-interface on this talk list, I <br/>

But you should also understand, I hold ill feelings towards you.  <br/>
What annoys me is your enthusiam for letterboxing.  In your quest to <br/>
be helpful--a noble task where your thoughts are certainly in the <br/>
right place--you tend to go overboard.  Like creating a letterboxing <br/>
website as an "alternative" to the original (which I feel ends up <br/>
fragmenting the original site if you succeed, but is probably a waste <br/>
of your time since other attempts at "alternative" sites have <br/>
essentially failed).  Rather than that, I wish you'd create a website <br/>
that provided more information and how-to tutorials instead of trying <br/>
to reinvent the wheel.<br/>
<br/>
You also tend to break 'Miss Janet's guidelines' about posting too <br/>
often, although that doesn't really bother me much since I don't read <br/>
most posts on this or the main letterboxing board.  Rather, it's just <br/>
another example of "too much" enthusiam that, at times, gets under my <br/>
skin.<br/>
<br/>
But if there's one good thing I can say about newbie enthusiasm, you <br/>
guys are great at creating letterboxing gatherings.  I'm thrilled to <br/>
death Bethany planned out last year's Steilacoom gathering.  And Sir <br/>
B's SLO gathering.  And even your Fright Fest gathering, although I <br/>
probably can't make it out to Tacoma in time for that.  You should <br/>
have seen my pathetic attempt at organizing Seattle's first <br/>
letterboxing gathering.  Puts me shame just to think about it.  Even <br/>
worse, I was the last one to arrive for it!  What an embarrassment!<br/>
<br/>
And if it's any consolation--probably not, but I'll say it anyhow--<br/>
I've also told others behind your back that I'd probably like you far <br/>
more in person than I do the persona in your posts.  Ironic, huh?  Of <br/>
course, that one I actually managed to send as e-mail.  *rolling eyes*<br/>
<br/>
Anyway....  there's a large following of anti-Ryan supporters out <br/>
there--I have little doubt about that--and they'll probably be <br/>
sending you an application to join their group soon.  If my apology <br/>
won't suffice, they'll certainly welcome you with open arms!<br/>
