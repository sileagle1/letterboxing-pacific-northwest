I agree with you 100% - absolutely!  Especially if I<br/>
know the placer personally or on the boards.  However,<br/>
my post was "generally speaking" - again, rules that<br/>
aren't written and that CAN be broken "depending". <br/>
Really, this hobby is one big grey area.<br/>
<br/>
I actually removed a large and OLD log from a box that<br/>
was left open, exposed and bagless.  I knew I could<br/>
dry it out over a week and return it by weeks end<br/>
without inconveniencing myself.  I did so.  I placed<br/>
paper between each indvidual sheet of log (which<br/>
smelled like cat urine and was slimy!) and changed the<br/>
paper three times a day until it was dry enough to not<br/>
break apart when I touched it.  I then used a hair<br/>
dryer to dry the sheets to the bone.  The book still<br/>
reeked of urine but the book was dry and rebagged and<br/>
still "intact" for the most part.  <br/>
<br/>
However, we recently found TWO logs that were moldy<br/>
and one that was irrepairable.  We contacted the<br/>
placer and have permission to "refurbish" the log as<br/>
they are unable.  We also know they are local - big<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
If you trek out on an 8 mile hike and find a<br/>
decomposing log - yea, I think you do something about<br/>
it. <br/>

Subject: Re: the unwritten rules<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it would've been a nice thing to do. I<br/>
have <br/>
taken a soaked book home and dried it out, later <br/>
returning it to it's home. If a book is totally<br/>
waterlogged, <br/>
I bet most placers would want you to take it out of<br/>
the <br/>
box, dry it and send it to them as long as you left a<br/>
r<br/>
eplacement in the letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Recently, I received an email about one of my boxes <br/>
in the East. The finder discovered the book soaking <br/>
wet, removed it from the plastic baggy and then left <br/>
it in the box to mold. I am only able to get there<br/>
once <br/>
a year for maintenance. I would've much preferred that<br/>
<br/>
they took it with them, returning it to me. This way,<br/>
it <br/>
will be useless by the time I get there. I, for one,<br/>
do <br/>
believe in taking a log with me if that's the best<br/>
first aid <br/>
option. I would never keep it but I would try to<br/>
preserve <br/>
it. Funhog<br/>

If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br/>
