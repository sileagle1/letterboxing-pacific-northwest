Boy, that is sure Canadian, cite the victim, and maybe we should get <br>
counciling for the perp. <br>

When I go hunting I usually leave an empty shotgun case showing, and <br>
no one has broken into my car to take it. That is the only thing of <br>
value that would be showing. <br>

This is good advice as well. My parents and another couple were at <br>
Ballard Locks in Seattle (also the location of a letterbox). When <br>
they parked the car, they placed their purses in the trunk. When <br>
they returned to the car, the trunk had been broken into and <br>
everything inside stolen. Police came and they searched the area by <br>
the parking lot at Ballard Locks. It seems there is a "homeless <br>
village" in the bushes in that area. <br>

Grew up in San Francisco Area -- and you always put the things in the<br>

any thot, so it's never an issue or a problem or a downer.<br>
<br>
I'm constantly amazed at the amount of THINGS people (women in<br>
particular) will put in their trunk, and then walk away to have what is<br>
obviously a long lunch.  Talk about an invitation!<br>
<br>
I go hiking as often as the next one of us -- and usually with my small<br>
-- I've never had a problem while out hiking -- but break ins in parking<br>
lots/trail heads are pretty well known issues...<br>

That reminds me....  When Amanda and I went to the Ft. Steilacoom <br>
event to hide our boxes in the park before the South Sound <br>
Letterboxing Stamp Fest (or whatever the event was called--I'm <br>
getting foggy on it now!), we had driven up within minutes after a <br>
car had been broken into.  I parked next to them then Amanda and I <br>
went off to hide our boxes.<br>
<br>
She was kind of concerned about OUR car--but I told her not to <br>
worry.  The break-in had been reported to authorities and there was a <br>
large crowd forming around the broken-in car.  They wouldn't be THAT <br>
stupid to break into another car right next to them with such an <br>
audience nearby!  =)<br>
<br>
Just glad we didn't park ten minutes earlier and left to hide the <br>
boxes....<br>
<br>
As a side note, the victims of the break in said that the woman's <br>
purse was stolen out from the front seat--it had been left in plain <br>
view.  *shaking head*<br>
<br>
Break-ins can and do happen everywhere.  The best thing you can do is <br>
make sure to hide those valuables!<br>
<br>
I had a friend who, in his younger, wilder days used to break into <br>
cars to steal CDs he saw that he wanted.  (Actually, he finally quit <br>
that habit when he was caught!)  Wasn't even to steal money, but just <br>
a CD that he wanted.  Would crack a baseball bat against the <br>
windshield which he said was VERY cool to watch it shatter.<br>
<br>
But after he was caught, he was required to pay for all the damage he <br>
caused.  Decided a $10 CD wasn't worth paying hundreds of dollars <br>
for....  =)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, the point of my story is this: Even a $10 CD was <br>
considered 'valuable' by this person.  Best bet: Leave nothing in <br>
plain view--even if you don't think it has any great value.<br>

The only time I leave something in plain view is when I'm out with <br>
my Brittany. Then it is an empty case for my shotgun.You might want <br>
to pick up a cheap gun case and leave it showing in the front seat.<br>

The "homeless" village was a bit of concern for me as<br>
I prepared to do a visit to Forest Park.  Due to<br>
situations that have unfolded in the past week we have<br>
postponed this trip until spring when life calms<br>
again....but I understand there to be quite a homeless<br>
population there and I'm not sure where they are in<br>
conjunction with the LB's that are located in the<br>
area.  However, I understand that bad/desperate people<br>
are to blame for bad things and not necessarily one<br>
particular group.<br>
