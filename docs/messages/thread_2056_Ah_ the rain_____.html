Howard at outdoor school.  I'll be there tomorrow and<br>
Thursday afternoon/night.<br>
<br>
Are there ANY boxes out that way?  I take the Corbett<br>
exit off 84 and head to Corbett Hill to Evans to<br>
Gordon Creek to Warriner.<br>
<br>
Anyone????????<br>
<br>
Oh, BTW, after spending all day today interpreting in<br>
the rain.....nothing can stop me from finding<br>
boxes!!!!  Not even a little (or a lot of) LIQUID SUNSHINE!<br>
<br>
LILY<br>
<br>
If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br>
