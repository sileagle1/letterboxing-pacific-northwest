                    <div class="plaintext-content">I paid a visit to box # 2 and 3 of the Foothill Trails series, placed <br/>
by Sunseeker and DZ Desi.<br/>
<br/>
I found # 2 fairly easily but did not find # 3 even though I was sure <br/>
of my location.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote Sunseeker and DZ to see how they are.  They have been fairly <br/>
quiet, I hope we did not loose them.<br/>
<br/>
This is a nice trail running over old railbed.  It could certainly <br/>
use some more boxes.  It runs from Orting to the east side of South <br/>
Prairie.  Did see some good birds, a Red-breasted Sapsucker at nest <br/>
and newly fledged Song Sparrow and American Dipper  being fed by <br/>
adults.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps next month.  I will have more free time then.<br/>
