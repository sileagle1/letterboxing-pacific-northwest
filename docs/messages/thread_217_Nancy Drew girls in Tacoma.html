visiting next weekend (Sat. May 31st). She is from San Francisco and <br>
is relatively new to letterboxing (no exchanges besides me). Her <br>
plane arrives around 1pm and she wants to immediately do some <br>
letterboxing. I was thinking of taking her down to Fort Steilacoom, <br>
just because there are so many boxes there and examples of so many <br>
different area letterboxer's art! :-)<br>
<br>
I know she would love to exchange with area letterboxers, so if <br>
anyone could make it down there Saturday afternoon, we'd love to see <br>
you! You know that I will probably be leaving some hitchhikers <br>
around! :-)<br>
<br>
If anyone wants to make more concrete plans to meet, just email me <br>
off board and we can set something up.<br>
