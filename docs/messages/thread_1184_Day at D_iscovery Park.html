                    <div class="plaintext-content">GREAT NEWS!!!  Although not out letterboxing today, I had a moment <br/>
to check on the Funny Little Man in D*iscovery Park earlier in the <br/>
day.  He was very much alive &amp; well!!!  It appears the clues to this <br/>
letterbox have already been pulled so I am unable to verify if <br/>
recent repairs in the park have affected the clues.  It appears that <br/>
the recent addition of a new bridge/boardwalk may affect the <br/>
interpretation of the clues?  Not sure since I can't locate a copy <br/>
of the old clues to figure out if they have changed any due to the <br/>
recent repairs.  The placer of this letterbox is not from the area <br/>
so I wouldn't know how to contact them at the moment.  Anybody know <br/>
how to contact the placer and have them repost the clues since it's <br/>
still there--very much wanting visitors?  I can review them once <br/>
posted and see how much/if anything has changed along the trail and <br/>
what needs revision.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the other boxes in this area, the little trail changes very <br/>
much from season to season (as I've learned the past several <br/>
months).  It also appears that a major windstorm has felled several <br/>
trees throughout the area since the series was placed and there has <br/>
also been some extreme erosion along various parts of the trail.  I <br/>
have a feeling this has much to do with the proclivity of missing <br/>
boxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks--<br/>

&gt; We then head over to the Wolf Tree Trail to do Candlelight &amp;<br/>
&gt; lp's boxes. Unfortunately, it was a sad sad trip. I looked<br/>
&gt; for the Blizard Boxes before and found two of them missing.<br/>
&gt; Nory wasn't with me that trip but together we found that<br/>
&gt; four of them are gone. Very very sad. And then, to make<br/>
&gt; things worse, we went looking for the Funny Little Man. He<br/>
&gt; seems to be gone too. What is up with the Wolf Tree Trail?<br/>
&gt; It's such a great trail but all of the gorgeous trees seem<br/>
&gt; to be taking all of the letterboxes!<br/>
