<br>
Eliza B carved a new stamp and I was finally able to get him placed.<br>
<br>
I returned "salmon" of Salmon Run box ( box three on this series is a <br>
double stamp box)<br>
<br>
Many people visited this box and did not get their stamp reward.  I <br>
hope some will repay a visit for one of Eliza's best.<br>
<br>
There were many new "faces" in the log book, I hope this is a sign of <br>
a growing LB population cluster in Seattle.<br>
