&gt; PZ Kut is the best product I have found for carving letterbox <br/>
stamps <br/>
&gt; &amp; it's available online--nice for folks who live away from the <br/>
major <br/>
&gt; retailers (wish I had stock in this home business!!!).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Their website is:  www.stampeaz.com/  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recommend purchasing at least 4 sheets at a time--it saves S&amp;H <br/>
$$$ <br/>
&gt; in the long run.  Each sheet runs about $5 a piece after shipping <br/>
&gt; and it's twice as large as the $9/ea 'pink stuff' available at <br/>
&gt; Mike's.  ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">i love the PZ Kut as well -- but even more economical is the White Stuff<br/>
I get at local art shops -- i get a 12 X 12 square of this stuff for<br/>
about 9 bucks -- about 3 sheets of the PZ Kut wide when I lay them on<br/>
each other.<br/>
<br/>
It's a lot heavier and more durable -- great for detail, but harder to<br/>
carve than the PZ Kut.  I use both -- but the White Stuff is cheaper.<br/>
Don't have any idea what it's real name is -- I just ask for carving<br/>
media at the local art store and this is what they give me...<br/>

I 100% agree, this is the media for me.  Economical.  They even have <br/>
seconds, which have some flaws in it but is still carvable.  It <br/>
carves well and you can get a lot of stamps from one sheet.<br/>
<br/>
The Michaels in my old neighborhood never had any carving media, <br/>
