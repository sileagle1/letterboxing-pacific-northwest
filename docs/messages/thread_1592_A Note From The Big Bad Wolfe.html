  After a short but sweet haitus from Grandma's house I am back and <br>
ready to rock! That pesky Little Red Riding Hood made things a bit <br>
difficult for me while she was visiting her grandma for summer <br>
vacation but now that she has gone back to school, I shouldn't be <br>
bothered by her for awhile. Now if I can only get rid of that nosey <br>
Mr. Happy Postman and those annoying Three Little Pigs and thier well-<br>
built little homes,I can have some peace and quiet for a change. Why <br>
don't you stop by for a visit and bring me some of those delicious <br>
brownies you all rave about. (and I don't mean the ones you bake in <br>
the oven, if you know what I mean) HeHeHe.<br>
The Big Bad Wolfe <br>
