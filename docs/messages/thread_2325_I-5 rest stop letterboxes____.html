After Christmas I am heading from Portland to San Francisco.<br>

I was thinking that I would get together a list of all the letterboxes<br>
at rest stops on I-5. Not the ones near the highway, or in the towns<br>
sourrounding the highway, but actually at real rest stops.<br>
<br>
Here are lists of the rest areas along I-5: <br>
California- http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/maint/ra/<br>
Oregon- http://www.tripcheck.com/Pages/RAentry.asp<br>
Washington- http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/biz/RestAreas/restareamap.htm<br>
<br>
It would be an interesting thing to someday have letterboxes at all<br>
the rest stops along I-5. That way you could stop at any one, and know<br>
that there was a box there! Think about how exciting family trips<br>
would be! You would be stopping every hour or so, but it would be fun.<br>
<br>
So far I have:<br>
Applegate Rest Area<br>
<br>
On The Road Again (at the Welcome Center in California.)<br>
<br>
-Moon something.... I printed out the clues to this one, found it, and<br>
then when I got back it had been taken off the website. I will see if<br>
it is still there. I wonder if this one has been abandoned?<br>
<br>
Any others to add to the list?<br>

   <br>
  In case you are interested in an alternate route for either direction, I do have two boxes I hid in one location along Highway 101, north of the Bay area in California.  They aren't at a rest stop, but it's equally as simple (a pull-off many use as a rest stop, I'm sure).<br>
   <br>
  I have received one update about them a number of months ago and they figured they were missing because the spot is a little odd and they said there was poison oak nearby.  (I was just looking to place them at the end of my road trip, had had a crappy couple of days, and just went for the nearest place I could find!)<br>
   <br>
  I realize it's kind of a stretch, but rather along the lines you've mentioned (just a different highway) so I thought I'd mention it.  It'd be nice if they had some visitors!!  Here's the addresses:<br>
