Howdy all, I do hope everyone has gotten a chance <br>
to enjoy the warm, dry weather of late. Just this <br>
afternoon, we headed to Vancouver, WA to have a<br>
look at the heron rookery by Vancouver Lake. If <br>
you haven't been there this year, this is the perfect <br>
time to take a jaunt over there. The nests are filled <br>
with birds, and the trees don't quite have their <br>
leaves yet. In a few more days, after the trees leaf <br>
out, it'll be pretty difficult to see all the avian activity.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Naturally, I had a peek at my letterbox hidden there <br>
and all is well. The log is nearly full but still has room <br>
for a half dozen or so visitors. Have you stamped in <br>
yet? Funhog<br>
