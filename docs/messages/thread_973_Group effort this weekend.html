<br>
*laughing*  Ah, don't worry.  I plan on hiding a few more in the <br>
Seattle area, so you'll have some more chances to nab one of <br>
those 'legendary' boxes of mine.  =)<br>
<br>
And I don't even plan to hide them on very strenuous hikes.  Okay, <br>
that's because most of my favorite hikes are now burried in several <br>
feet of snow, but that makes all the better for you.  ;o)<br>
