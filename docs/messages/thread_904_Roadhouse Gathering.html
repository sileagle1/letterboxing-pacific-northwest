<br>
Are you or is someone else going to carve<br>
the event stamp?  If not I wouldn't mind<br>
trying my hand at it.  Or how about this,<br>
if you already have someone, how about if<br>
I do the Octagonal Barn.  Always been <br>
kinda fond of that structure, for some <br>
reason or the other.  Mebbe it has to <br>
do with my upbringing in western Nebraska.  ;o)<br>

Whomever does this house, don't forget the<br>
ghost rumored to live on the 3rd floor.<br>

of you wonderful Letterboxers that I so frequently see your your stamps in <br>
the logs books that I have found.  And to meet all of you face to face, and no <br>
one had a mask on, HeHe.  We will definitely have to get together and go Boking <br>
someday now that I know so many of you live here so close to us.  And to Team <br>
