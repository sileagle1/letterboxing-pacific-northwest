                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I spoke too soon.  Had plotted out a great adventure to<br>
Northeastern Washington and Northern Idaho for a nice outdoorsy trip in<br>
early May and what happens?  Putting the canoe away last night I twisted<br>
my leg and fell.  I now have a badly sprained ankle with torn ligaments<br>
and a possible fracture.  ARGH!!!  The doc says forget about major hikes<br>
for a while.  I'm in an aircast for at least two weeks and on crutches<br>
for at least one and am not allowed to stand or walk for any prolonged<br>
amounts of time until further notice.  This sure puts the keebosh on my<br>
big letterboxing plans for parts unknown.  <br>
I even have a triptix in the works from AAA for this trip.  <br>
<br>
Fret not, though!  Once I'm allowed to be "normal" again (yeah, right,<br>
like I ever was), I'll see what I can do about getting up to the Spokane<br>
area.  At the very least I can certainly live vicariously for the<br>
adventure by carving stamps for the letterboxes that will hopefully be<br>
placed when I am back in action.  <br>
<br>
Sorry to get your hopes up Hang Glider.  When I know when I'll be up<br>
that way I will certainly let you know and I will certainly try to place<br>
a letterbox or 10 while I'm at it just for you!<br>

Just for you, the Friend's Landing boxes are on a wheelchair accessible<br>
trail, assuming it isn't high tide and parts of the trail are flooded.<br>
<br>
Get all better VERY soon!<br>

out, but about your mishap!  Go put that injured limb up on a pillow, keep<br>
the ice packs on it, and catch up on your reading!  Whatever you do, don't<br>
push the recovery - take time and let it heal completely or you'll be<br>
fighting with it for longer than you need to.<br>
<br>
With best wishes for a complete and timely recovery,<br>

P.S., School is out next week, so maybe I'll have some time to get a few<br>
more boxes planted up this way before you head up this direction.<br>
