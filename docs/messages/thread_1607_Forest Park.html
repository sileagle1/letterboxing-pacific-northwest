about the area before you go boxing each and every time you go.  I<br>
understand it once in a while if you are going really out of your way, a<br>
different state whatever to go boxing, but when it's local c'mon, it just<br>
starts to seem like you don't want to get out there and LOOK for the box,<br>
you just want to get out there and FIND it, and personally I don't want to<br>
be someone else's cheat sheet to letterboxes either.  The owners of all the<br>
Series you mentioned are current and active in the group and I can assure<br>
you if any of us know there is something wrong with our boxes our clues<br>
surely are adjusted to tell you so.<br>

out....what a riot.  Sure am glad I read them<br>
thoroughly before setting out.  I've been humming the<br>
whole time while working on them and will be humming<br>
on this one while we're out...hope not to scare anyone<br>
in the process.  Of course the kids won't have a clue<br>
what I'm humming but then again, what do they know<br>
about MUSIC! HeHeHe<br>
