Spokane searching out one of our boxes....reason being I am moving to <br/>

looking forward to it. Spokane however has 9 boxes!!!! And that is <br/>
it! So all you LBPNW members when you head near Spokane on your <br/>
travels please please please plant boxes during your stay. I will <br/>
miss about my regular walks in Portland and hope to still maintain my <br/>
boxes from there. I am sure you will all keep me posted on any <br/>

What?  There are an article in Time magazine last week?!  When did <br/>
this happen?!  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am moving to Spokane and out of the Portlannd Area....:( <br/>
<br/>
Say it ain't so!  <br/>
<br/>
Well, on the bright side, you could plant a dozen letterboxes in the <br/>
Spokane area and you'll be the Big Cheese (or Big Goose, as the case <br/>
may be) of letterboxers in the area.  =)<br/>
<br/>
You could even organize a stamp camp and encourage a gaggle of <br/>
people (get it?  Goose?  Gaggle?  I crack myself up sometimes!) to <br/>
spend an entire weekend planting and finding boxes out in that part <br/>
of the country.  Spokane is a really neat little town!  Or even <br/>
somewhere 'nearby' like near the Grand Coulee Dam.  Just get them <br/>
into eastern Washington and they'll hide boxes all over the area.  <br/>
It'll become a mecca for letterboxers wanting to make pilgrimages to <br/>
Spokane.<br/>
<br/>
It can happen!  =)<br/>

Be sure to give his eastern WA mystery box a look. I have hidden several boxes in the <br/>

"Letterboxing..."  The term does seem familiar ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Nice to see an increase in activity over here.  Guess I'll have to get<br/>
the carving tools sharpened up and dust off the hiking boots!<br/>

I just got into this sport. As soon as I get my tools I plan on <br/>
planted lots and lots of boxes in Spokane. Including some <br/>

Doug and I live in Spokane and have been letterboxing since the Time Mag article.  Unfortunately this is a rotten time to be searching for plastic containers...way too much snow!  But, welcome to letterboxing in Spokane, I have a feeling good things are happening here.<br/>
