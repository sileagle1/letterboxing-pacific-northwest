                    <div class="plaintext-content">our usual choice for parking is the dome station and the free Link <br/>
rail.  free covered parking and a train ride!  otherwise you can park <br/>
right by the first Tall Ships box and hoof it to the bridge of glass.<br/>
the thread reminds me of a joke:<br/>
<br/>
Q.  What's the difference between a Seattle driver and a Tacoma <br/>
driver?<br/>
A  In Seattle they think nothing of paying $10 for parking but don't <br/>
want to pay for the road, and in Tacoma they'll pay for the road but <br/>
have a screaming fit if asked to pay for the parking.<br/>
<br/>
it describes me anyway, i'll go to great lengths to not pay for <br/>
parking.  we go to Seattle on sundays or holidays for example.<br/>

&gt; Er, I'm making reservations for 13 unless anybody else contacts me <br/>
&gt; later this evening.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the way, follow Harmons' website for parking directions.  There <br/>
&gt; are some options for non-pay parking but you'll have to research it <br/>
&gt; before you go.  Otherwise, the best parking is the pay-parking lot <br/>
&gt; directly across from Harmons and east of the WA History Museum.  I <br/>
&gt; think it's about $4 for the evening or so--but that's if you <br/>
&gt; pay 'after' the computer says 6pm otherwise it's more.  We usually <br/>
&gt; park way over by Thea Foss Waterway and walk the Bridge of Glass to <br/>
&gt; get there--so that's always an option as well.  See you then!<br/>
