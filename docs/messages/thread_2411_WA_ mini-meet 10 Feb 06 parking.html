                    <div class="plaintext-content">our usual choice for parking is the dome station and the free Link <br>
rail.  free covered parking and a train ride!  otherwise you can park <br>
right by the first Tall Ships box and hoof it to the bridge of glass.<br>
the thread reminds me of a joke:<br>
<br>
Q.  What's the difference between a Seattle driver and a Tacoma <br>
driver?<br>
A  In Seattle they think nothing of paying $10 for parking but don't <br>
want to pay for the road, and in Tacoma they'll pay for the road but <br>
have a screaming fit if asked to pay for the parking.<br>
<br>
it describes me anyway, i'll go to great lengths to not pay for <br>
parking.  we go to Seattle on sundays or holidays for example.<br>
