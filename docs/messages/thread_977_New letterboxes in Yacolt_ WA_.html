I see it as only fitting that I contribute to the excitement and <br>
place some more boxes besides my Happy Postman Series. There are two <br>
new letterboxes in Yacolt, WA.<br>
Lucia Falls Letterbox and "Luv Ya" Letterbox. Both are located at <br>
Lucia Falls Park with some spectacular views of some waterfalls. When <br>
placing these boxes, Cat's Meow and I witnessed an amazing sight! A <br>
number a very large salmon were trying to make their way up the falls <br>
to spawn. This is something that I have only witness on TV but to see <br>
it in real life was amazing! Be the "Firsties to these boxes for an <br>
added surprise! The clues for these boxes are posted on the <br>
letterboxing.org website. Happy Hunting!<br>

P.S. Watch for other letterboxes to be placed in the surrounding area <br>
soon!<br>
