Circus Memories boxes came up missing. (Thank you Old Blue for  bringing me<br>
the box). Last night I replaced it and while I was at it, added another box<br>
to the series. <br>
 <br>
Anyone who goes after this series is now in for stamp shock. The first two<br>
in the series are two of my oldest carvings, the last two just done. Wow,<br>
what a little practice will do for you! <br>
 <br>
So, if you've already done Circus Memories but want a nice walk, go find<br>
boxes 3 and 4!<br>
