of the anniversary of its eruption (May 18, 1980).  I'm happy to say we found <br/>
Eliza B's Eagle Cliff LB--tho the clues are not as straightforward as they <br/>
appear--a LOT has changed in the area since the box was planted.  If you are <br/>
one of those who delights in the "golden triangle" that was discussed <br/>
recently on the main list--meaning you really enjoy figuring out how the <br/>
landscape has changed since the box was planted, you should stop reading <br/>
because I'm about to talk about that.  But if you'd like helpful clues to the <br/>
clues, read on....<br/>
<br/>
The main difference is that the picnic area has been extended--so it would <br/>
now be more accurate if the clue read "Follow the trail under the bridge and <br/>
past the *first picnic table* to a ..."  Also, the "clearing" has now become <br/>
a little forest of lodgepole pine.  But other than THAT :-), the box was <br/>
right where Liza said it was.  And we were only the second group to stamp in, <br/>
so git yourselves up to MSH, people!  We planted two more boxes in the <br/>
general area to help entice you up there.  (I'll include a notice on this <br/>
list when their clues are posted.)<br/>
