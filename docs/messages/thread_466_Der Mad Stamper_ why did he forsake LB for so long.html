&gt; &gt; The last time I saw Mitch (Der Mad Stamper) was at the 1st <br/>

&gt; &gt; Letterboxers get together a couple years ago.  At that time he <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; &gt; just finishing up his degree at the Rock Creek campus, and I had <br/>
&gt; &gt; heard he was offered and had accepted a web developer position at <br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; &gt; of the east side colleges.  I believe he had plans to move his <br/>

&gt; &gt; to that side of the city, Gresham, if memory serves.  I can't <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; At any rate, I'm pretty good at using the Internet to find people <br/>
&gt; so <br/>
&gt; &gt; let me give it a whirl and see what I can find.  If I find him, <br/>
&gt; I'll <br/>
&gt; &gt; ask him to make a guest appearance or send an email stating his <br/>
&gt; &gt; wishes with his boxes.  If I can't find him or he doesn't <br/>
respond, <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; say we divvy the boxes up among many to keep them alive at least.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; One suggestion when this whole subject of Abandoned Boxes came <br/>
up, <br/>
&gt; &gt; was to credit the creator of the box(es) and also state our <br/>
contact <br/>
&gt; &gt; info. for the maintainer.  I like that approach and it gives <br/>
credit <br/>
&gt; &gt; where due.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What exactly is the process to adopt another's box?  I've sent a <br/>

I certainly don't like anybody speaking for me, so<br/>
my feelings are if he wants to post on the main page <br/>
that he's back, then let that be "his" choice. <br/>
