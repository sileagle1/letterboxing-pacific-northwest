I am personally getting ready for the gathering in Corvallis next weekend.<br>
As far as I know, its the largest gathering EVER in Oregon. (Correct me if<br>
Im wrong). As of right now there are 96 people signed up to be there with<br>
another 10 or so due to be there that I know of. Are YOU coming? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Its going to be a blast!<br>

We moved far, far away (although we abandoned lots of our boxes in the <br>
PNW until that point when we can return which may be in 6 years or <br>
so).  :(  I doubt people on this board are very concerned with what's <br>
going on in the Greater DC area...<br>
<br>
Oh, we've found a whopping 10 letterboxes since we arrived here and ALL <br>
of those were at the Delaware: It's a Game Gathering a few weekends <br>
ago.  Otherwise, I've driven past at least 2 dozen known letterboxes <br>
relatively close by but haven't yet found an opportunity to look for <br>
any of them.  :(  Yes, real life has eclipsed letterboxing, <br>
unfortunately.<br>

boxing is just fine. Torrential downpours and frigid days aren't all<br>
that common. I always keep a big sheet of plastic folded up in my<br>

cheapo umbrella from the Dollar store is always there,too. <br>
<br>
An alternative, relatively dry, place to box is on the east side of<br>
the mountains. There are lots of great letterboxes in Central Oregon,<br>
and lots of blue sky. It can be chilly December and January but most<br>
of the other months aren't too bad. Enjoy! Funhog<br>

  I guess people don't use this yahoo group much anymore... where is<br>
  everybody? According to the stats on the homepage, there were only 47<br>
  messages posted last month, the fewest messages in ANY month since this<br>

They are evil I tell you, evil!  Each difficult clue reveals one word of the directions to the box.  There's two pages of them, 53 clues actually.  <br>
<br>
The box I'm working on is in pieces on the counter, the sink is full of dishes, but I have only the hardest clues left to solve!<br>
<br>
Oh, the sad, sad life of a clueless letterboxer.<br>

  I was wondering the same thing. I like this regional connection and enjoy<br>

  As it turns out there are people out there! (Almost 400 . . . who would<br>

  I guess people don't use this yahoo group much anymore... where is<br>
  everybody? According to the stats on the homepage, there were only 47<br>
  messages posted last month, the fewest messages in ANY month since this<br>
  group started back in March of 2003 -- less than HALF the messages<br>
  posted in Sept of 2005, and 6 times fewer than in Sept of 2004. This<br>
  month there were only 18 messages in 19 days, on track for even fewer<br>
  messages in October. The stats also say there are 392 members of this<br>
  group - so where IS everybody? On the national chat list? Atlas<br>
  Quest? No longer boxing? Avoiding me personally? What's the deal?<br>

  I, for one, have been hunched over a set of letterbox clues for fat lady's<br>
newest box. Ever hear of Cryptic Crosswords? They are evil I tell you, evil!<br>
Each difficult clue reveals one word of the directions to the box. There's<br>
two pages of them, 53 clues actually.<br>
