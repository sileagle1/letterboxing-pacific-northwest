I usually do whatever repairs on site that I can.  Baggies and <br/>
logbooks are easy...I almost always have those on hand (and if there <br/>
are no baggies handy, a poop bag works too!  A clean, empty one, of <br/>
course!).  I've been known to replace a soggy logbook with a fresh one <br/>
and then contact the placer for further instructions.  I have pulled a <br/>
few boxes that belong to people I know if the box is in really bad <br/>
shape.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't usually carry boxes around with me, but I was boxing with a <br/>
group of people once and we found a broken and soggy box.  Between all <br/>
of us in the group we had everything needed to replace a box in our <br/>
bags.  Luckily, the stamp was still salvageable, but I'm sure we could <br/>
have replaced that too if needed.  :-)<br/>
