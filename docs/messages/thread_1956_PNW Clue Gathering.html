Well he's coming home for a visit, so the Brat Pack is hosting a gathering<br/>
and what's a gathering without games? <br/>
<br/>
You are hereby invited to join us at Wall Street Pizza for a letterboxing<br/>
version of "Clue". Thanks to Scarab of the Doubtful Guests, we are going to<br/>
get to use the set of 22 stamps they put together. Can you figure out who<br/>
did it in which room and with which weapon before anyone else does? Can you<br/>
collect all the stamps? <br/>
<br/>
We already have RSVP's from lots of old friends and new, I hope you see YOU<br/>
there as well. <br/>
<br/>
Those that RSVP in time will recieve an email about 3 days before the event<br/>
with a list of all local boxes and about how much time to allot for them if<br/>
you're interested in combinding some boxing with the gathering!<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, please email me at maiden1974@verizon.net<br/>

Thank you Maiden for hosting such a wonderful gathering! I haven't <br/>
played Clue in a long time so I had a lot of fun. It was great to see <br/>
my old friends again. As always, it is always a pleasure to see Der <br/>
Mad Stamper and box with a legend (love ya man!), I was able to say <br/>
an official goodbye to the Rayvenhaus family before they leave for <br/>
Alaska (you will be greatly missed), Bookworm (don't worry, Cat's <br/>
Meow still loves Carmen and Sophie), Maiden's family, Pupp and Jenn, <br/>
Dave from Beaverton and Bethany and family. I also made some new <br/>
friends, Erfellie and Sandi (Erfellie lose the flip flops, they are <br/>
not official letterboxing attire LOL), Miniles (we will have to hook-<br/>
up and box someday), The J-Rock Family, Natalie, JayMan and Cherokee <br/>
(remember Cherokee, when you least expect it!). Thank you all for a <br/>
wonderful time and I hope to see you all again soon! <br/>

Sounds like Saturday was a big success! Congrats to Melanie and shame on me for <br/>
being stuck over in Central Oregon hiding letterboxes. Hopefully, this wasn't my last <br/>
opportunity to meet up with some of the long distance travelers and to laugh at their <br/>
lovely footwear. I'm glad everyone had such a great time and sorry I couldn't share in <br/>
it. I need a clone. Funhog<br/>
