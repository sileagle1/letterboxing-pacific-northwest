would love to know if there are some drive bys between Portland and  <br/>
Spokane.<br/>
<br/>
Please share any favorites in the Spokane area too! We'll be camping  <br/>
at the KOA and going to meetings in SE area I believe. I hope to be  <br/>
able to do some boxing in the eves. but they probably would have to  <br/>
be short hikes or drive bys.<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions!<br/>
