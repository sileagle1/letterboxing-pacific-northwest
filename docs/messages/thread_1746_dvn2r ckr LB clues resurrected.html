The calm after the storm...<br>
<br>
I finally got a chance to 'redirect' ALL of the links from the LBNA <br>
site to our letterbox clues site.  Not fun after adjusting some 89+ <br>
entries! :(  I also deleted LBNA links to clues to any boxes that <br>
are confirmed as missing and tried to modify/amend any clues that <br>
needed it.  If y'all come across some incongruencies with the <br>
links/clues to our boxes (since we modify them continously and don't <br>
recall every minutiae lost in the hackattack), please let us know & <br>
we'll try to adjust them as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Also, some clues aren't listed on the LBNA site--remember, not <br>
everything is always as it seems!<br>
<br>
See you on the trails sometime,<br>
