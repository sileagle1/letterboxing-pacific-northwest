new idea or something. Flutterby and the 7Nails' Snail Mail boxes were making the <br>
rounds ages ago. <br>
<br>
Maybe everybody is expecting an especially hard winter and are afraid that they won't <br>
get a chance to get out and find any letterboxes. Or maybe someone should start the <br>
Couch Potato Postal Letterbox for those who don't want to bother... Funhog<br>
