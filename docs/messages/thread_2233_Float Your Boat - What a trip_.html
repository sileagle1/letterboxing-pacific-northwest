in Spokane last weekend.  HSM, indeed you are very ambitious  -  so many<br/>
boxes placed!  No doubt this puts Liberty Lake on the map of destinations<br/>
for Lbers.  And thank you to Colls who carved stamps (and not sure what all)<br/>
for the gathering.  Also thanks to Thunderbird for the book binding class.  <br/>
<br/>
It was so nice to meet new people and have faces to go with trail names.<br/>
And of course see the T-bird family again.<br/>
<br/>
We had a bit of a misadventure on the way home.  While on Steptoe Butte<br/>
Wood-aug stepped with his toe and heard a pop - messed up his leg.  The<br/>
Pullman doc thought it was a torn Achilles tendon but the orthopedic surgeon<br/>
here says it's a torn muscle.  Poor guy.  But he's a sport and hobbled<br/>
around placing and finding boxes anyway.  We must have been quite a sight -<br/>
his strange halting gate and our dog limping along (Simon has a growth<br/>
between his pads that was quite raw from walking, poor thing).  Funny,<br/>
usually I'm the one limiting our movement.  What a change!  <br/>
<br/>
We learned a lot this trip - mainly that we suck at placing!  {laugh} We<br/>
placed a record nine boxes this trip!!  That is huge for us!  But we learned<br/>
a lot from the experience.  Wish we could have placed more in Spokane for<br/>
the Lb pioneers that are doing so much work there.  Many of the boxes are in<br/>
far reaching places - some on the way to . . . well . .  no where very<br/>
populated.  {laugh}  We hope to post the clues soon.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of you - There are lots of boxes already in Spokane proper (we<br/>
only had time to find 6).  They are placed at various levels of physical<br/>
difficulty so there's something for everyone.  If you go, don't miss Manito<br/>
Park!!!  WAY cool place!!  Who would have thought Spokane would have<br/>
something so grand!  We can't wait to go back, see the rest of the park, and<br/>
find the boxes we missed there. <br/>
<br/>
Colls, thanks for the great history you wrote up with your box in Rosalia.<br/>
Very neat location too.    I won't say much just that it's an inspiring and<br/>
refreshing place for those from an urban environment.   Nothing quite like<br/>
it here.<br/>
<br/>
Colls, could you email me which Liberty Lk stamps you carved?  I'd like to<br/>
note that in the log book.   BTW, because of Todd's leg, we ended up camping<br/>
at Chief Timothy Park after all.  It was neat to read the billboard which<br/>
connected the history together.  Neat park.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
SloMo &amp; Wood-aug    <br/>
