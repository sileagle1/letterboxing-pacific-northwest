to chase her ball there and sniff other dogs butts. <br/>
<br/>
We planned on hitting Trial and Errors tortoise and hare box, but DH <br/>
left our compass in Yakima and we planned to use the one mounted in <br/>
the truck. We got out, removed the compass, and found that outside of <br/>
the truck it read West no matter where we turned. So, we set off <br/>
using DH's impressive navigational skills, but gave it up after about <br/>
10 minutes. So our first time looking for a box and not finding it! <br/>
Boo hoo-a perfect record broken!<br/>
<br/>
We did manage to find dvntrseekrs "rehabilitation" box, along with <br/>
the fledgling and the "Boo" box, we wanted Leschi Gallows, but since <br/>
it's reportedly missing went instead to the "RIP" box, as DH wanted <br/>
to see the cemetary. Ran out of time before getting the rest of the <br/>
park boxes.<br/>
<br/>
4 wasn't bad considering we had no compass-and hey, Cleo had a ball, <br/>
and even sniffed butts with another black lab named Cleo!<br/>
