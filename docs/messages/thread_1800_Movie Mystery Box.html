The heavy rain last night reminded me that I've been neglectful in <br/>
removing my Movie Mystery box for the winter. I went out today to <br/>
find that the box was dry but the trail to it not. Rather than risk <br/>
it becoming a litterbox, I doffed socks and shoes and went over <br/>
about twenty feet of very cold, six inch deep water to rescue the <br/>
box. It will return sometime next year after the flooding danger has <br/>
subsided (and I manage to get around to it).<br/>

Thank you for the giggle I got from reading your message.......I <br/>
drove by there last nite and thought of it, glad you got it safe and <br/>
sound and you didn't get taken down stream from all the rain water!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care and stay dry!!<br/>
