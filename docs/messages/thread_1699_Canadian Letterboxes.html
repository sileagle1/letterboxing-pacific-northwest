I've just joined this group, so you may see some old news. Re: the <br/>
Canandian Gathering. I too, would like to thank the Secret Gardeners <br/>
for more than just the gathering. I only started letterboxing in <br/>
2002, at a time when they had already started the ball rolling. I <br/>
was extremely sorry to hear they were leaving the area.<br/>
<br/>
Our American neighbors were ambassadors in the true sense of the <br/>
word. This was my first gathering, and they were all about the <br/>
friendliest people I could have hoped to meet. I'm looking forward <br/>
to seeing them all again.<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to Ryan for the event stamp. It was very impressive.<br/>
<br/>
We're working on the Whistler and Nanaimo boxes. The Prince George, <br/>
Sicamous, Taylor, Tlell, and Atlin boxes will be found as funds <br/>
allow. We are only about 2 km from the U.S. border, and so a lot of <br/>
those boxes are closer. . . but, the circle is expanding!<br/>
