we thought my "sickness" on Saturday was from too much alcohol on <br/>

If Rayvenmom can email me offlist her and I can make some arrangements <br/>
for the "Singing for my Supper" letterbox I have sitting in the <br/>
backseat of my car. I haven't made it back over to Wapato Park to see <br/>
what was left of the tree that this particular box was hidden at the <br/>

<br/>
I'm still queasy feeling today but it sounds like you all had fun at <br/>
