<br/>
I think the changes are awesome, but I noticed a couple of things in Eastern Washington that probably should be changed.  <br/>
<br/>
The Southeast Washington section includes the Quick Draw:  Rock Climbing Series #4 Box located near Vantage, WA.  Vantage is actually in Kittitas County, and this box belongs in the Cascade region.<br/>
<br/>
The Northeastern WA section contains the Canterbury Box, nearby city:  Olympia, WA.  Olympia is in Thurston County, and this box should show up in the Thurston-Pierce section.<br/>
<br/>
Minor details, but I'd hate especially to have someone miss Quick Draw because they were looking at the wrong map.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Woo Hoo, Choi!!!  Thanks for taking the map to the next level. :) It <br/>
looks awesome and it functions really well.  The regional lists are <br/>
much more manageable now.  It will definitely come in handy when/if <br/>
this hobby gains popularity in the state (just imagine--Connecticut <br/>
has 2,500 'listed' letterboxes in an area that's about 1/20th the <br/>
size of WA--hard for me to fathom!!!--imagine if this region every <br/>
came anywhere near to that sort of LB population).  Just noticed a <br/>
couple of boxes that 'fell' into incorrect regions but it's because <br/>
their designated counties are obviously incorrect.  Not sure if the <br/>
planters did this intentionally to make 'finding' boxes a bit more <br/>
challenging or by accident.  In a cursory look, I think I only saw <br/>
three that fall into this category.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't yet checked the regional names to see what we <br/>
ultimately 'went' with.  I'll run through those and compare them <br/>
with the feedback/recommendations we received from the LbPNW <br/>
community.<br/>
<br/>
trkee--thanks for your tireless effort in manipulating the 'magic' <br/>
behind updating the map.  Without your 'remote' assistance this <br/>
wouldn't have happened any time in the 'remotely' near future.  <br/>
The "Paint" editing program just doesn't cut it...  ;)<br/>
