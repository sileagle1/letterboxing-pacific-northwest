Click on "view photos" where you will find some photos attached to the event page - Miniles also posted a public album that you can find by clicking on "browse albums" and sorting them according to date - hers will be very recent if not at the very top.  Miniles is a great photographer and captured some of the best photos I've ever seen - those of you who live in or have visited Central Oregon know that there are numerous opportunities for fabulous photos here.  Being Miniles' first visit here, we didn't want to give her just the sunshine, so we provided her with a wonderful rainstorm to "get her feet wet" in.  The shots she got of the sky during that shower are just incredible.<br/>

It was so fun having this event, I will be sure to organize another one for next summer if not sooner.  Next time I will get the covered pavilion in Redmond's dry canyon so that rain won't dampen any festivities.<br/>
