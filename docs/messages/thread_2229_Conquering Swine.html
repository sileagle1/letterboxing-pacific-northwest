                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ever since I started letterboxing, Ryan's letterbox at <br>
Nesmith Point has been one of my personal goals. I <br>
like long hikes but I'm not the fittest pig in the pen. Dog <br>
Mountain has always been my standard for a serious hike. <br>
Tales of the difficulty of this other trail have kept me <br>
back. However, with the appearance of Double Tree <br>
this year, I have been on the DT Fitness Program all <br>
summer, finding her letterboxes right and left. <br>
<br>
For any of you who have found many of her boxes, you <br>
know that some of them are looooong hikes, some with <br>
a considerable elevation gain. In the last few weeks, I <br>
have been on her Ruckel Creek hike (twice... now, that's <br>
another story) been to Tunnel Falls and up the hill to <br>
Wauna Viewpoint. For good measure, I've thrown in a <br>
visit to Ryan's Angel's Rest box and a few other short, <br>
easy jaunts. <br>
<br>
Yesterday, I decided that I was probably closer to being <br>
able to complete the hike to Nesmith Point than I've ever <br>
been. I packed up my letterboxing gear, found some <br>
lunch stuff, filled bottle after bottle of water (I took about <br>
a gallon) and headed out. I am VERY pleased to report that <br>
the letterbox at the highest point in the Columbia River Gorge <br>
is alive and well.  I rested a lot, took a long time but I made <br>
it with no mishaps and, unbelieveably, no sore muscles today. <br>
I'm so danged proud, kinda like a pig in mud! Funhog<br>
