has been missing since 2003! I was not aware until someone emailed me <br>
just the other day that it was gone and only the crocodile box was <br>
still there. So Ryan carved a replacement stamp and I went today to <br>
replace the letterbox! And I had been recommending that one to <br>
everybody as one of the best Seattle area boxes! Wow<br>
<br>
Well, the gorgeous stamp is back and with an appropriately Asian <br>
themed logbook. <br>
Enjoy!<br>
