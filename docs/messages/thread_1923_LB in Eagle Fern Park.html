Tuesday I had a wonderful frosty morning hiking through Eagle Fern <br>
Park with a fun swine. The shadows were frosty with ice sicles, but <br>
the sunny spots were fresh and beautiful. We had the entire park to <br>
ourselves. We found "Triple trouble" without any trouble. Then found <br>
all the "Farm friends" warm and dry.{We didn't even slip in the <br>
frosy mud.) Even saw a "Cotton tail" snuggled comfortably under its <br>
log. If you want a beautiful hike with lots of fun creatures to <br>
find, I suggest you wander down to Estacada.(with a pair of boots <br>
with good traction) <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll second that!  Wood-aug & I went to Eagle Fern last summer and had a<br>
great time.  The boxes that I thought we'd never find (such as "cotton<br>
tail"), we found.  I don't know if they're still there but Buffalo Baby and<br>
Morning Ritual are pretty neat too.  Triple trouble was very fun... although<br>
we couldn't get box #1.    It was a great time.  I look forward to going to<br>
more Estacada parks - so neat.<br>
<br>
Happy boxin' all!<br>
