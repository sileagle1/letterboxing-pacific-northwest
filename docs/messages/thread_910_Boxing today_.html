                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, Campfire lady and my clan decided to do some boxing today with Sleepy <br/>
Whippet, Pandora, Iron Bear and Wingnut.  They brought along Bookworm, <br/>
Transplanted Cowboys and See Shore.  It was a beautiful day the the Pittock Mansion.  <br/>
Great stamps there for the Haunted Series.  Everyone got a bit frustrated <br/>
looking for Sleight.  We gave up on that one. We then decided to go with Pandora <br/>
and Iron Bear to find the Lost Letterbox and who do we come across, but <br/>
Stargazer Woman and her friend Dopey (a first timer).  This was our first time at <br/>
meeting someone on the trail.  Then I find my 1st Hitchhiker.  While on the way <br/>
home following Pandora and Iron Bear, a woman in a huge car, and I drive a huge <br/>
van decided to side swipe me.  But this old Willow with her quick driving <br/>
skills swerved, as I did this she saw what she was about to do and she swerved, <br/>
and went to the right very quickly and across the street she goes into a pole <br/>
and almost a wall.  What a sight.  It got my heart pumping.  Luckily everyone <br/>
was alright. But she has a huge dent to fix.  We always seem to have something <br/>
interesting happen to us while letterboxing.    Willow.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh Mudstumpers! You just missed the last group at Pittock Mansion by <br/>
2 hours. We had left there by 2:00pm to find the Lost Letterbox. It <br/>
would have been great to exchange with you as well! The get-together <br/>
didn't start out as a gathering but ended up being one with Pandora <br/>
carving a really cool mini-event stamp on the way to Pittock Mansion. <br/>
I now have in my possesion a traveling event stamp that I will make a <br/>
notebook for and have available for the next event. <br/>
Funhog's "Sleight" letterbox seems to have gone missing but all of <br/>
the Halloween Extravaganza series and the Lost Letterbox are alive <br/>
and well. Thanks for some great stamps! And yes, there was a close <br/>
call between two very large vehicles on the way home from the Lost <br/>
letterbox but fortunatley, that's all it was. No damage to Willows <br/>
van but I can't say the same for the woman who veered into our lane. <br/>
OUCH! She was lucky not to have rolled her SUV with all those kids in <br/>
it. Thank you all for coming to Pittock Mansion. It so nice to see <br/>
you again after the "gathering that we won't mention the of". Thank <br/>
you Iron Bear and Pandora for leading us to finding the Lost <br/>
letterbox and two more letterboxers as a bonus!<br/>
