I have to work that day :-(, but may be able to make it late.<br>
<br>
Wanted to let all the attendees know of another event at Millers <br>
Sylvania park that day.  From 4 to 6 PM there will be a Flag <br>
Retirement Ceremony.  The Lacey Post of the American Legion, <br>
Daughters of the American Revolution, Boy Scouts, Lacey Sunrise <br>
Lions, and otd hers will be retiring well-used flags in an <br>
appropriate ceremony.  These groups fly flags and collect used flags <br>
from others.  Stay for the celebration of our American Flag and all <br>
it stands for.<br>
