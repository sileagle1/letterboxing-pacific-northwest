Recently a gentleman named Andy Wilkes aka The Happy Wanderer posted <br>
on the forums about exchanging signature stamps.  He's located in <br>
Bristol, England.  I emailed him back as apparently a TON of people <br>
did and today got an envelope with 15 images in it all in a nice <br>
little plastic envelope to protect them and a sheet with each <br>
image's name, box number if it's registered, owner's name and <br>
location - all in England and some in Dartmoor.  This was very <br>
cool!!!<br>
<br>
If you didn't sign up with him you might want to - this is defintely <br>
a special occasion.<br>
