                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had posted at the beginning of this week about our weekend at <br>
Lincoln City. We were hoping to hear if anyone recenty had found the <br>
boxes that we were unable to find which were:<br>
*Devils Lake<br>
*Yaquina Head Lighthouse<br>
*Van Duzer Corridor<br>
When we can't find boxes we always like to know if we were even close <br>
or it really was missing. That is part of the fun of going back to <br>
find it if we were just missing it to try again to find it.Thanks for <br>
any help anyone might give.<br>
