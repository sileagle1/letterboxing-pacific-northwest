<br>
Snake Lake is gearing up for a major remodel/overhaul/Hwy 16 cleanup <br>
project. The letterbox/geocache friendly staff has let me know that <br>
all trails markers will be replaced and renumbered this winter. The <br>
two large footbridges will be completely reconstructed. Recovery <br>
projects as a result of the unavoidable impact to the preserve which <br>
has occured over the course of the last two years due to Highway 16 <br>
widening are starting now. The staff believes that all the <br>
letterboxes and geocaches could be impacted or compromised over the <br>
next year as a result of the entire remodel/construction project. <br>
<br>
I have confirmed that the entire Snaky Lake series which was placed <br>
in the preserve as part of their letterboxing class (in partnership <br>
with Adventure Seeker) was destroyed by vandals. They don't <br>
officially track any other letterboxes or caches in the park so they <br>
cannot confirm the status of them individually. They did recommend <br>
that box/cache owners follow-up frequently to ensure that their <br>
boxes/caches aren't impacted by the parks improvements and that they <br>
are not negatively impacting the area in which they are located.<br>
<br>
If someone has a specific box they want to check on and can't get <br>
there let me know offlist. I drop by Foss every Friday morning (my <br>
daughter attends school there and I'm the PTA President) and can <br>
followup on boxes/caches if I have exact directions to them.<br>
