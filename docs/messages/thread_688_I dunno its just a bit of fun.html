I remember last year the East Coasters were fairly bouncing off the <br>
walls between rain and snow storms.  We figured there would be a rash <br>
of plantings in the Spring with all those house bound folks.  I bet <br>
many of them are remembering that.<br>
<br>
I have carved and sent boxes for two theme plantings.  Don't think I <br>
can do the childrens book series quick enough.<br>
<br>
It is always fun to see other peoples stamps and ideas.  Overall <br>
fairly harmless fun.<br>
