The Clueless Letterbox is alive and well.  Great hiding spot.  We were <br>
second to log in.  Thanks for the hunt Ryan.  =)<br>
<br>
Bad Hat.  What a cute park.  The trails have been very recently maintained, <br>
and we enjoyed our walk to the box.  Nicely worded clues too.   Also another <br>
good hiding spot.  Box was a little damp but we dried it out.  Log book etc <br>
were in great shape.<br>
<br>
Dolphin Mystery.  Another really nice walk.  Good amounts of shade for a sun <br>
weenie like me.  Sadly 3rd box is not the charm.  We were unable to locate <br>
this box.  The first place we looked appeared to be completely covered by <br>
very high water.  The second place we looked (an Ah Ha moment) also turned <br>
up nothing.<br>

suspicions a while back when I got a bunch of accidental finders' <br>
reports on it.  Now, who on Earth would accidentally find this box <br>
where it was hidden??? grumble, grumble  Finally checked on it today <br>
and it was nowhere to be found.  <br>
<br>
I'll replant this one in time--give me a chance to catch my breath <br>
and I'll work on it.  Until then the dolphin has unfortunately swum <br>
away.  :(<br>
