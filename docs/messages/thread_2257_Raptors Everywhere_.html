&gt;  The placer's name is VERY similar to yours.  If you did, I have a<br/>
&gt; funny story about it for you and will e-mail you off-group if you <br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes I did place that box.  I lived above that coffee shop when I was <br/>
living there.<br/>
<br/>
I know, I just need to be patient with boxes here.  Back on the EC, <br/>
you arely had to wait a week before people found your boxes, so I <br/>
forgot that there isn't as big a community everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to pm me the message.  That is actually my most visited box!<br/>
