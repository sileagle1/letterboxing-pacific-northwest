                    <div class="plaintext-content">Took Mo and Dan out to check out some of our local boxes today.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the report:<br/>
Mo's Carrot and Fresh Fruit at Lois Lake Nature Trails are both doing <br/>
fine with a few visitors.  Jo the Alien at Lois Lake Park across the <br/>
street is also doing quite well too.  There have been a couple of <br/>
different new 'boxers to these three and we have recieved emails <br/>
thanking Mo for the introduction to letterboxing.  Seems the Nail <br/>
Family Letterboxes attract new families to the sport!<br/>
<br/>
My latest box at Al Anna Homann Park in Lacey has had one visitor to <br/>
date.  Thanks Fudrick for the honor.  Everyone in the S.Sound should <br/>
check this one out--I believe it may be a contender for the world's <br/>
smallest letterbox.  It used one of those tiny plastic boxes from <br/>
those breath strips for this one. Complete with postage stamp sized, <br/>
1/8" thick hand carved stamp and homemade log book, this box measures <br/>
less than 2"x1"x1/4".<br/>
<br/>
A side trip to Wonderwood Park saw Mo's Pencil and Bill the Robot in <br/>
good shape with the same newbies logging in as well as some old <br/>
favorites.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, Dancing at Bougival is still waiting for visitors and doing <br/>
quite well.  The latest visitor left a surprize for the next finder.  <br/>
<br/>
All 7 boxes checked are doing great and ready for summer visitors.<br/>
<br/>
One strange thing however--checking over the log on Bougival I <br/>
noticed that someone had stamped a small image in the middle of the <br/>
large log book--about 40 pages from both the front and back of the <br/>
book.  The image was rather humorous but ponderous.  It was of the <br/>
Calvin character of Calvin and Hobbes.  Everyone has seen his image <br/>
poking fun by urinating on this make of truck or the other.  Well, <br/>
this time Calvin is urinating on the LBNA logo!  My first reaction <br/>
was that a naughty geocacher had stumbled on our box but later I <br/>
began to think that something else was up.  I have an idea but I want <br/>
to see if anyone else has any knowledge of this stamp appearing in <br/>
other boxes? Let us know.  I removed the stamped page to keep and <br/>
show Happy Mom. She laughed when she heard and saw.  I also dont <br/>
think that a such a hateful thing as this belongs in a letterbox of <br/>
love ;-)  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Was in Wonderwood Park last night, checking on your visitor.  Checked most of my boxes there, some new people out and about.  One was in plain sight, standing up in it's cubbyhole, uncovered.  Not a good thing to have happen, they should be well hidden.  Thankfully noone noticed it for the two plus weeks it was exposed.  Did not find your new stamp in the ones I looked for it in.  I claim that it was getting too dark for the last ones, won't let on that I forgot where they were :-(<br/>
<br/>
Your Homann Park box (?) is great.  Was surprised that it was so small, yet had so much paper in it.  When I removed the boulder (such a large rock for such a small box) the hatch was not totally closed.  Maybe a baggy for the rainy season?  That area looks like it serves as a retention basin in the winter.  When I put it back (ensuring it was well closed!) rolled the boulder back over it, as I was walking away something was crawling up my arms.  Ants!  Checked the boulder, it was also covered with ants.  Maybe they like letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Fudrick<br/>
