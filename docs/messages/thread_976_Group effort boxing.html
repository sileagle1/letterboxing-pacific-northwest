Hope you didn't waste too much time waiting for us. The boys woke <br/>

Maybe I'll sneak out on them this afternoon....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We waited but not overlong.  I suspect the average LB'r is a punctual <br/>
type person 8) Sorry the kids are in cranky mode.  Right now with so <br/>
many kids coming down with the flu it is a bit scary.<br/>
<br/>
The RayvenClan and Rayvendingledogs joined me.  The hike was OK for <br/>
me, but RayvenMom, still recovering from surgery had a bit of a tough <br/>
go at the first stiff climb as the adrenaline kicked in and kicked <br/>
her but good. She was the lead spotter and spotted the clue catchers. <br/>
<br/>
The clues were well written but the venue holds many challenges.  In <br/>
a forest filled with moss covered trees and olde stumps finding the <br/>
right one is problematic until you come upon The Right One!  There <br/>
are always lessons to be learned.<br/>
<br/>
We found two of three, totally missing any referenced stump log or <br/>
stream for box three. <br/>
<br/>
I am a bit perplexed by the presence of Euros in these boxes.???  <br/>
Anyone know how this is significant?<br/>
<br/>
The boxes could use some new baggies, none of use were carrying any.<br/>
<br/>
I left the RayvenClan with well worn out RayvenDogs to return to the <br/>
barn to shave Jay the Wonder Pony for the second time this Fall.  <br/>
They were planning to tackle some of the Tiger Mountain boxes.  I <br/>
suggested the coal mine associated boxes as the elevation gain and <br/>
distance should be doable for RayvenMom. <br/>
<br/>
I got a sneak peak at the Black Pearl Treasure that will soon be <br/>
winging its way around the country.  I am eager for this series to <br/>
start here.  It should be mighty fun.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to all, rumor has it the sun was out today.  We were fairly <br/>
fog bound.<br/>
