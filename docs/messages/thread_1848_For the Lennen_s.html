Hi :o) Just curious... I have the same last name, same spelling, <br>
usually people tend to spell it Lennon, so thought I might inquire... <br>
My family is very distant and I dont know any Lennens beyond my <br>
grandfather Donald Eugene Lennen who married Patricia and he died <br>
like 30 years ago, My moms maiden name is Deanna Lynne Lennen and <br>
shes 46, we live in southern oregon and I think my mom and her dad <br>
lived in Los angeles before he died. Anything sound familiar?  <br>
thought i would ask... chances are theres nothing there but it cant <br>
hurt to ask :o) <br>
