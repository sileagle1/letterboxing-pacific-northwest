One thing I've started doing to my stamps to hopefully avoid <br>
this 'tradefully' bad problem is to write the name of the letterbox <br>
on the back of the stamp.  Since I recently had a mishap involving a <br>
letterbox stamp that ended up in a geocache about 100 miles away <br>
from its 'resident' letterbox carried off by an unknowing soul, I've <br>
started writing the word letterbox after the name of the box on the <br>
stamp.  Hopefully, this may preclude these problems from occuring in <br>
the future.<br>
