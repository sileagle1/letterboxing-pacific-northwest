Clues:<br/>
Birthplace of Seattle Letterbox<br/>
Seattle<br/>
King County<br/>
Washington<br/>
Place on the first day of spring, March 21, 2004<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Moderate<br/>
Path: Level, some scrambling over seaweed-covered rocks.<br/>
Distance: 1.7 miles round trip or less if shortcut is taken.<br/>
<br/>
Check the Elliott Bay Tide table for Seattle before searching for this<br/>
letterbox. It can only be found at or near low tide. Check the tide table<br/>
at http://www.nwsource.com/weather/tides.html before heading out. You must<br/>
plan your trip around the tides!!!<br/>
<br/>
The founders of Seattle came by water on the schooner, Exact from San<br/>
Francisco in 1851. The Denny Party landed on this beach on November 13th.<br/>
As one might expect, it was cold, miserable and pouring down rain. You must<br/>
find out where in Seattle the Denny Party first landed.<br/>
<br/>
There is a concrete obelisk commemorating the Denny Party landing in this<br/>
public park. It has a piece of Plymouth Rock in it. If you find Lady<br/>
Liberty first, head west to the obelisk. Once you've found the obelisk,<br/>
take a moment to read its interesting facts on the founding members of the<br/>
Denny Party.<br/>
<br/>
Head due south 40 paces. Here you'll find a bronze plaque commemorating<br/>
David Denny and Lee Terry for building the first log cabin in Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
Continue south from the plaque. You will cross paths with the Admiral. Stay<br/>
out of his way. Soon you will see a sign for the Court of Marguerite. Her<br/>
Court will be to your right. Continue south until you find a tide pool cast<br/>
in stone. Look for starfish and a greeting octopus.<br/>
<br/>
Head 270 degrees, which is west (all readings are magnetic). Search for the<br/>
Avenue of Stars. You must look down to see the stars above. Read about the<br/>
constellations cast in bronze as you walk along. Soon your path will dead<br/>
end.<br/>
<br/>
Look for concrete pillars and a chain rail. Keep this on your right as you<br/>
head 290 degrees. If you keep a sharp lookout, in a bit to your right, you<br/>
will see a hand-made memorial for two young men who drowned near this<br/>
location on February 9th, 2004.<br/>
<br/>
Seek out the building that is the sailor's guiding light. Scramble up the<br/>
rocks to the building. Be very careful. The rocks lower down are covered in<br/>
seaweed and are very slippery. Near the northeast corner of the building,<br/>
look for a gray boulder with a big black spot on it. It also sports a<br/>
wooden hat. Tan boulders surround it. Search the first crevasse to the<br/>
right (as you face the boulder and building). The letterbox is deep within.<br/>
The stamp is mounted on wood. To get a good impression, press very firmly<br/>
on it where the lettering occurs.<br/>
<br/>
Be very discreet with the letterbox when finding, stamping and re-hiding<br/>
it. Many eyes are watching<br/>
<br/>
Retrace your steps to the starting point, or try to figure out an easy<br/>
shortcut.<br/>
<br/>
This is my first planted letterbox. Please let me know what you think.<br/>
