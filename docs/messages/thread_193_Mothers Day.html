We had a nice walk on a beautiful sunny day and found Amanda's 3 Schmitz <br/>
Park boxes. We took a look at the beginning "stairs" to Mee-Kwa-Mooks <br/>
and decided that it was intended for a more athletic audience (as befits <br/>
a planter called "Jill the Reckless").<br/>
We had a picnic at Camp Long and looked for Kathyh's Camp Long box, <br/>
found the exact stump described in the clues, but no box.<br/>
We looked around, so I think this one may be missing. It was a fine walk <br/>
anyways, and the nicest Mothers Day I could have spent.<br/>
