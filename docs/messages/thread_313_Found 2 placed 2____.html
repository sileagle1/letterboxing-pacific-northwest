Duzer Corridor!!!!  Came up empty on Beneath the Blue #2, but as <br>
were searching I remembered reading something about this possibly <br>
missing.  If it is not missing and I have to go back, not a problem <br>
as it is a beautiful campground. ( we are going back this summer!!)<br>
We had a fun time.  Also planted a Boiler Bay LB and We love Lincoln <br>
City LB!!!!!<br>
thanks for the fun!!!<br>
