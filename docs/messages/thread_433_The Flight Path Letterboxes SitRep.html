We went this past Saturday to the Flight Path 6... What a wonderful hidden trail!  Here's the status:<br>
<br>
US Airways - Alive and well, found and stamped!<br>
Delta - Missing in action!  The location had recent teenage party remanants and I fear the box was discovered and, well, lost.<br>
Northwest - Missing in action we think.  We found the trail, but could not locate a tree with a holly bush by it within the distance expected.<br>
American Airlines - Alive and well, found and stamped!<br>
United Airlines - Alive and well, found and stamped!<br>
Alaska Airlines - Missing in action.  We found the log at the side of the road, right were it should be, but no box anywhere in a 50 foot radius. (shucks!!!)<br>
<br>
Overall, we had such a blast in this trail, it was awesome!<br>

my daughter recently went on a plane "for the first time" (she last flew<br>
at 18mos old and tells me "that doesn't count, mom!") -- and as we<br>
taxied in and out of the various airports (starting and ending with<br>
SeaTac) she would point out the tails that had symbols that matched our<br>
letterbox hunt (MoM!!!! That's one we found -- ooh! and that one too!!!<br>
mom!!!!)<br>
 <br>
she had a BLAST!!!!<br>

We did go all the way back to the large field, coming through it to the SW corner just as the clues indicated, but did not find a tree with a holly bush near it there.  Now, let me make sure I know what a holly bush looks like. It's leaves are the pointed thorny ones that will rip your fingers to the bone, right?  (grin)<br>
<br>
We'll return and re-search for the Northwest and Alaska ones this coming weekend.<br>
<br>
I hope that the Delta box will be soon replaced (hint, hint!)<br>

Here is what the Northwest Clues say:<br>
If you were on Northwest Flight #7 to Tokyo, you would be looking <br>
down and see me go on past a couple of sewer man-holes then taking a <br>
right on a dirt path up a slight hill. You would see me stay to the <br>
left when I reached an open grassy field and reentering the woods on <br>
the SW corner of the field to a multi-trunked tree with a holly bush <br>
beside it. You would see me carefully reaching into the southern side <br>
of the tree between it and the holly bush. Opps you are gonewinging <br>
your way to the Orient.<br>
<br>
The Tree with the Small Holly bush next to it is between the grassy <br>
field area and the edge of the "cliff" that looks back down at the <br>
paved path. The Holly Bush is on the side of the tree that is on the <br>
side of the paved path (away from the grassy field area)<br>

Nope:<br>
<br>
If you were on Northwest Flight #7 to Tokyo, you would be looking down and see me go on past a couple of sewer man-holes then taking a right on a dirt path up a slight hill. You would see me stay to the left when I reached an open grassy field and reentering the woods on the SW corner of the field to a multi-trunked tree with a holly bush beside it. You would see me carefully reaching into the southern side of the tree between it and the holly bush. Opps you are gone.winging your way to the Orient.<br>

Could be!! I remember I had the East and West wrong originally. I <br>
thought I had fixed it! But now that I think about it, I think you <br>
are right, it is the SE corner (from the grassy area) Basically, you <br>
want to be heading back toward the paved path and AWAY from the <br>
grassy area! Whichever direction that is!! :-)<br>

Well then, it appears that the clues are still incorrect. <br>
<br>
....the left when I reached an open grassy field and reentering the woods on the SW corner of the field to a multi-trunked tree with a holly bush beside it....<br>
<br>
So, we're saying, once we enter the large grassy, we stay to the left, reentering the woods in the SE corner of the grassy area, not the SW corner of the grassy area.  Good, cause I'm here to tell you, there's no multi-trunked tree with a Holly bush near it on this trail off the Sw corner.  (grin)<br>
<br>
We'll head back and find the box!  Thanks for the update.<br>

The Tree with the Small Holly bush next to it is between the grassy <br>
field area and the edge of the "cliff" that looks back down at the <br>
paved path. The Holly Bush is on the side of the tree that is on the <br>
side of the paved path (away from the grassy field area)<br>
