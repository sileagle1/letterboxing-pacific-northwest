<br/>
I'm thinking it might be about time for another Letterboxing gathering<br/>
in the Portland area.  It's been a while.  We had a wonderful gathering<br/>
in Portland in August 2002 at Upper MacLeay Park organized and hosted by<br/>
Funhog, which was a blast.  <br/>
<br/>
In November 2002 Bethany, a.k.a. Dvntrcker or however she spells it,<br/>
hosted an event that exceeded expectation, food, and letterboxing fun in<br/>
the Olympia/Tacoma area!!!  (South Sound Chili is outstanding and easy,<br/>
by the way!)  Lots of great letterboxers showed up for that and God<br/>
blessed us with a beautiful day and a wonderful view of Mt. Rainier.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking Oxbow Park in the Gresham/Boring area might be a good place<br/>
to host.  It does cost an admission fee of $3 per car, though, unless<br/>
you have a Metro Parks pass, and if that is cost-prohibitive I'd be<br/>
willing to take other suggestions.  There are two letterboxes there<br/>
already -- Cara's Oxbow Letterbox #1 -- (#2 has been missing forever)<br/>
and Funhog's Riverbend Box.  It's a large and wonderful park that would<br/>
have lots of good hiding of letterbox opportunities.  It is right on the<br/>
Sandy River, too, for those who enjoy canoeing, kayaking, innertubing or<br/>
swimming.<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate input on what you think of the idea and appropriate dates<br/>
for such an event.  The end of July is out for me, otherwise, I'm open<br/>
to all ideas.<br/>
<br/>

I was there back in the early 90's.  We had ribs at a place called<br/>

city.  I sure like it better than St. Louis.  Just my opinion.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; In November 2002 Bethany, a.k.a. Dvntrcker or however she spells it,<br/>
&gt; hosted an event that exceeded expectation, food, and letterboxing fun in<br/>
&gt; the Olympia/Tacoma area!!!  (South Sound Chili is outstanding and easy,<br/>
&gt; by the way!)  Lots of great letterboxers showed up for that and God<br/>
&gt; blessed us with a beautiful day and a wonderful view of Mt. Rainier.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm thinking Oxbow Park in the Gresham/Boring area might be a good place<br/>
&gt; to host.  It does cost an admission fee of $3 per car, though, unless<br/>
&gt; you have a Metro Parks pass, and if that is cost-prohibitive I'd be<br/>
&gt; willing to take other suggestions.  There are two letterboxes there<br/>
&gt; already -- Cara's Oxbow Letterbox #1 -- (#2 has been missing forever)<br/>
&gt; and Funhog's Riverbend Box.  It's a large and wonderful park that would<br/>
&gt; have lots of good hiding of letterbox opportunities.  It is right on the<br/>
&gt; Sandy River, too, for those who enjoy canoeing, kayaking, innertubing or<br/>
&gt; swimming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd appreciate input on what you think of the idea and appropriate dates<br/>
&gt; for such an event.  The end of July is out for me, otherwise, I'm open<br/>
&gt; to all ideas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best regards,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
