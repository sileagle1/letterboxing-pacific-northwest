                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Everyone!<br>
<br>
I'm thinking it might be about time for another Letterboxing gathering<br>
in the Portland area.  It's been a while.  We had a wonderful gathering<br>
in Portland in August 2002 at Upper MacLeay Park organized and hosted by<br>
Funhog, which was a blast.  <br>
<br>
In November 2002 Bethany, a.k.a. Dvntrcker or however she spells it,<br>
hosted an event that exceeded expectation, food, and letterboxing fun in<br>
the Olympia/Tacoma area!!!  (South Sound Chili is outstanding and easy,<br>
by the way!)  Lots of great letterboxers showed up for that and God<br>
blessed us with a beautiful day and a wonderful view of Mt. Rainier.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking Oxbow Park in the Gresham/Boring area might be a good place<br>
to host.  It does cost an admission fee of $3 per car, though, unless<br>
you have a Metro Parks pass, and if that is cost-prohibitive I'd be<br>
willing to take other suggestions.  There are two letterboxes there<br>
already -- Cara's Oxbow Letterbox #1 -- (#2 has been missing forever)<br>
and Funhog's Riverbend Box.  It's a large and wonderful park that would<br>
have lots of good hiding of letterbox opportunities.  It is right on the<br>
Sandy River, too, for those who enjoy canoeing, kayaking, innertubing or<br>
swimming.<br>
<br>
I'd appreciate input on what you think of the idea and appropriate dates<br>
for such an event.  The end of July is out for me, otherwise, I'm open<br>
to all ideas.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

very nice woods that could accomodate many boxes, has an outdoor picnic <br>
shelter for the boxers, and *might* be available on a certain day only--or <br>
mostly--to letterboxers (I would have to check that last bit with my husband, <br>

I was there back in the early 90's.  We had ribs at a place called<br>
Darryl's.  Man, was it delicious!!!  We also visted that great museum<br>
with the dinosaur bones at the University.  KC seemed like a nice little<br>
city.  I sure like it better than St. Louis.  Just my opinion.<br>
