as often as I can -- taking my nephew every year is my excuse right <br/>
now!<br/>
<br/>
Just suggestions (maybe you already know where you're planting): I <br/>
don't know how well you know EF, but I would suggest planting <br/>
somewhere along the first part (the old part) where there are plaster <br/>
displays of fairy tales.  Kids don't linger over those, but it would <br/>
be easy for LBer's to linger pretending to look at them as they wait <br/>
for people to clear out.<br/>
<br/>
Planting by the Old Women's Shoe would be bad, as that is very <br/>
popular.<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, I bet you're going this weekend.  I wish I could go with you <br/>
(and meet you and Monkeyboy) and help you plant one.  But I am taking <br/>
off to Corvallis tonight (Friday) and won't be heading back to <br/>
Portland until Sunday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you do place one as I want to take my nephew <br/>
again this summer and I have yet to get him out LBing, except one <br/>
time with my ex-husband, and the box was gone.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time at EF and I hope to meet you soon!<br/>

&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; I'm taking my son to Enchanted Forest and it seemed like a fun <br/>
place  <br/>
&gt; to plant but don't want to step on anyone's toes if there are some  <br/>
&gt; there already.<br/>
&gt; I didn't find any listed. Does anyone know of any there or of any  <br/>
&gt; near there that we should try for. If not I'll try to find a good  <br/>
&gt; place for at least one for now.<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
