we got over halfway through the clues before we lost the trail.  There's <br/>
been some tractoring, clearing, blackberry cutting, and mowing of trees in <br/>
there, and I think some of the clues don't apply anymore.  I would have <br/>
e-mailed the placer, but can't seem to link from the clue page as on most. <br/>
So if you're reading this, that's what happened!  We had a nice walk in <br/>
spite of no box. Lovely smell of cottonwoods in the air, and a green heron <br/>
in the drainage.  Definitely not a wasted trip (they never are).<br/>

Ahh, so you fell into that trap, too, eh?  At least you had a more <br/>
pleasant walk than my letterboxing buddy and I did...  We were there <br/>
WHILE they were doing the backhoe work, and after some rather <br/>
illicit behavior had evidently occurred.  (If you see magazine <br/>
pieces, don't look at them!  Baaaaad!)<br/>
<br/>
All three of the Mt. Vernon boxes by alorente/Whizbang/Windairen are <br/>
defunct.  My friend and I looked for them for two days and employed <br/>
(discretely) numerous resources, but to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
Darth Vader has been moved to a new location by park staff during <br/>
clearing, and has possibly been removed entirely since by vandals.  <br/>
The clues as posted will not lead you to it, either way.<br/>
<br/>
The Pride of the City may still be in place, but the path has long <br/>
since grown over and is (short of with the aide of a machete) not <br/>
accessible.  That is, if it's still even there.  However, <br/>
considering the amount of use of the area by homeless and other <br/>
individuals engaging in unhealthy behavior, I doubt the boxes are <br/>
still there.<br/>
<br/>
Albert the Elf is more elusive, at best.  We followed the clues as <br/>
well as we could, including hints and solutions from the placer, but <br/>
could not find the "broken up" object that hides the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
We were really frustrated, as these were our first failures at <br/>
finding boxes for which we'd set out to find.  I had thought the <br/>
clues would be taken down or the boxes improved, as they are <br/>
obviously not functional as they are, but I guess I was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Way to look for the positive in everything, though!<br/>
