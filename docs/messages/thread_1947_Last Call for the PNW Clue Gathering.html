Just wanted to put out one last announcement for the PNW Clue <br/>
Gathering on Saturday, March 12th, 2005. It will begin at 11:30 AM <br/>
at Wall Street Pizza on Main Street in Gresham, Oregon. <br/>
<br/>
We will be working to solve a mystery murder (which involves 22 very <br/>
cool stamps) and meeting new friends and old. <br/>
<br/>
It is not necessary to RSVP, but those that do will recieve a list <br/>
of boxes in the area and other details. If you don't RSVP and <br/>
suddenly get a craving for REALLY good pizza, salads, or baked <br/>
spaghetti join us anyways!<br/>

<br/>
My mom and I were thinking of making an impromptu road trip to this gathering, but it would be a bit of a trip as we're in Boise, Idaho. (And, I'd probably have my 20 mo. old son with me.) Anyway, I was wondering if you'd be willing to share a list of who's coming, or if people would just pipe up on the list if they're going. I really do want to make it to a gathering before my next baby arrives, but I'm not sure if we could make this one. If I knew we'd meet some of the people I've "met" on this list already, I might be more likely to make the effort. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Krista (aka Grifos)<br/>
