                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were excited to plant a new box over Memorial Day Weekend because  it's in a really cool area AND there are no letterboxes around (that we  could find). <br>
  <br>
  A region dubbed "Oregon's Outback" in the southern central section of  the state, is amazingly dramatic -- with lava rings, salt lakes,  dramatic volcanic scarpes and wide open vistas. <br>
  <br>
  The new box borders Lake Abert, an 'inland sea' and is called "Heaven and Earth". Check it out on www.letterboxing.org. <br>
