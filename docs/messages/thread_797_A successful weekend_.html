                    <div class="plaintext-content">Despite the rain and cold I was able to get out this weekend and pick up a couple of boxes.  Since I was just up the street in Beavercreek for a whippet race meet, I toodled over to check out Bistro.  What a cool little park and a great stamp!  I'm proud to say I was the first one to stamp in (my first first!).  And as an extra bonus, there were clues to another box called "Preserve" in the same park (which gave me my second first!).  A very fun hunt.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, I hooked up with Sleepy Whippet at McIver Park and found First Time's A Charm and Special Delivery (LOVED this container!).  Both were in good shape, but Special Delivery is out of room in the log book.<br>
<br>
On the way to today's whippet race meet, I stopped to find Frog Park, and while I looked hard, all I found was an old Coke can, a really nasty sock, and a bee's nest with some cranky bees.  Sleepy Whippet later told me that it was missing.  Dang it, where was she at 8:00 this morning with that little tid-bit??  Must have missed that post.<br>
<br>
I thought I could outsmart the weather and stopped at CCC for the Duck Pond Friends series (sorry S.W. I had to).  This park is a treasure! I went to CCC for 2 years and never knew it existed.  Heather, your boxes are safe and sound (and dry), but #2 needs a new log book.  There was room for only 1 stamp after I put in mine.  #1 was just fine.  Both boxes had some activity as recently as the 10th of this month.  The downpour that we ran 1/2 our race meet in caught up with me while looking for Perseus and sent me scurrying back to my car.  I will be back though!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to Fright Fest!<br>

So you snatched firsties on Saturday. We visited both those boxes on <br>
Sunday for seconds:)Thanks for informing be about Duck Pond #2 log <br>
book. I was just over there last week, but did not notice the log <br>
was full. Sorry you didn't find Frog Pond. I deleted it off the clue <br>
list a week ago. <br>
I am really interested in seeing a whippet race. Where and when <br>
might I see one?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not a problem about Frog Park.  There have been so many posts flying around lately about boxes that might or might not be missing and might or might not be pulled that I was getting confused.  I had printed the directions to Frog Park a while back, and didn't pull it out of my "boxes to find" stack when I saw the post.  It was a charming little park and a surprise to find it in the neighborhood, so it wasn't a total loss.  <br>
<br>
As for the whippet races, the season is just about over.  You can catch the last one around here up in Roy, Washington on October 18-19th.  E-mail me privately if you want to know more.<br>
