                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a great weekend. We picked up several boxes on Friday, met up with lots<br/>
of good people to stamp into some cute postal boxes, and planted several<br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Today Team Nashoba and I went up Beacon Rock. It was a gorgeous hike, the<br/>
air was crystal clear and you could see forever. We didn't find the box, but<br/>
we enjoyed ourselves anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found that one lately?<br/>

them spent the time doing "Lookout" while I crawled all over the rocks<br/>
searching. It was a busy trail but not as busy as I had feared. I'll have to<br/>
go back and look again.<br/>
