boxes hidden by Kokopelli in the Hood River Valley. I came home with four of the five <br/>
fine stamps in my logbook.<br/>
<br/>
This driving tour is absolutely gorgeous. I only wish I hadn't eaten lunch before I <br/>
headed out as this trek takes you to a series of places for fine vittles and drink. It's as <br/>
much a food tour as a letterboxing trek. As I type, I can smell the apple pie from the <br/>
Apple Valley Country Store as it bakes in my oven. Now I need to go up Dog Mountain <br/>
to work it off.<br/>
