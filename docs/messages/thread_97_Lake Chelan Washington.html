wonding if there are any lb there, I have searched to no avail?  Can <br>
you please post if you know of one?  Other wise I am thinking I <br>
better get to carving!  I know I am new to all this, but just want to <br>
say you all have been so helpful and fun!  This is great, I have a <br>
feeling you will all get to know me quickly!  LOL.....  <br>

Incase you didn't know, I was Cyndie626, I set up a new account just <br>
for lb, so I am now "WingNut_LB"  This is what I will place my boxes <br>

opinion.... the path can be altered for a couple of letter boxes!  <br>
Now I just have to convince dh of that.  Which shouldn't be too hard, <br>
dd needs to stop every hour or so to stretch her legs, (she's not <br>
quite two and it's a 4 1/2 hours drive for us)  <br>
probably going thru Olympia and on over....  I will <br>
start "collecting" clues for areas along the way! And ideas are <br>
greatly welcome!  They just need to be fairly easy and short walks <br>
because of time and dd's little legs, lol.  Thanks so much!  Cyndie<br>
