<br>
Fret not about lonely letterboxes in your area!<br>
<br>
We're hoping to visit the Spokane/Coeur d"Alene/Metaline Falls area in<br>
the month of May, so Hang Glider may see new stamps in his/her<br>
letterboxes if we are able to seek them out on our road trip.<br>
<br>
As for Aryn...I have a family reunion in Blackfoot the last weekend in<br>
July.  There is a lot going on for us during that time, but I'm really<br>
hoping that somehow, somewhere along the way we will be able to search<br>
for some of  your letterboxes, as well.  <br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

Initial Point in Kuna and there were several stamps in it...yippee! <br>
I'm not sure who the people were, but now I want to check my other <br>
boxes too.  <br>
<br>
Plant some more Amanda!!  They are welcome or just stamp your cute <br>
paisley orca into some of our books. Yippee!!  OK I'll calm down.  =-)<br>
