                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had been showing Molly the town, and did not take her kennel with, (you know, space, the final frontier) so when we got to Vernonia Lake we realized we came out from Portland without it!  @#&amp;$ !!  She is there, but the box is in Portland.  <br/>
<br/>
We were thinking that we could drop the empty box at an easy location in Portland and someone going to the gathering, could pick up the box and re-unite it with the stamp and logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Any takers?  We could easily drop at Fanno Creek, since we have to return that box, or Tryon Creek is also on our list of to dos or even the ESP box on the Eastside Esplanade.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, <br/>
