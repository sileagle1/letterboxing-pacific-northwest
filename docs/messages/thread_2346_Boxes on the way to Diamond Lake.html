                    <div class="plaintext-content">On my way to Ashland last September I picked up Applegate Trail by <br>
Erfellie, Applegate Rest Stop by Green Tortuga (I cheated, not too proud <br>
to admit that, on this one), Myrtle the Turtle by Erfellie, and Bucky <br>
Beaver, a geo/LB hybrid - all were not far from the freeway more than 10 <br>
minutes if I remember correctly, and they were at good places to take a <br>
break and stretch your legs.  I can't remember if Myrtle and Bucky were <br>
south of Roseburg or not, but you could check them out.  I think the <br>
other two are way south of Roseburg but they were were nice images - I <br>
know Applegate Rest Stop is down by Valley of the Rogue Campground, <br>
because that's where we stayed.  Of the four, if I had to choose one for <br>
you it would be Myrtle for the short walk - if you are not lucky you <br>
could spend a fair amount of time finding Bucky, as the park is bigger <br>
than where Myrtle lives.  Erfellie will give you very good driving <br>
directions if you ask her.  It's in a park I can't imagine anyone not <br>
liking, and they have bathrooms :)  Have fun on your trip!<br>

There are several short hikes or drivebys on Hwy 138. All have <br>
waterfalls. California Bear has 3 in his Thundering Water Series, and <br>
we planted Watson Falls Fox and it is about as driveby as it gets.<br>
Sunshine has one at Diamond lake it is a stroll, but flat. If you have <br>
some time you could try for Dumbledore's Western Adventure a little <br>
south of your destination. It is a driveby mystery box, but it takes <br>
some figuring out prior to leaving your computer, and you must have <br>
the weatherman on your side. Possibly the road may be closed?<br>
