                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a reminder that the Kubota box is missing. It was a really great <br>
one, but the Japanese Gardens are very well manicured and I do not <br>
plan to replant that letterbox. <br>
<br>
Depending on what part of town you are staying in...on the Eastside, <br>
there is the whole Issaquah/Cougar Mountain area -- they are all great <br>
stamps and it is a neat place to hike. In Bellevue, anything planted <br>
by Green Guillemot. In the Northeast, the Redmond Elementals and WSP <br>
are terrific (anything by Mischief is terrific.) West Seattle has <br>
several great boxes along the Alki waterfront which is a lovely walk <br>
(Constellation, Cormorant Cove, Weatherwatch, Birthplace of Seattle <br>
and the Lincoln Park and Schmitz Park boxes etc.) Around SeaTac are <br>
Turkey Dinner, the Flight Path series, and Halitaeetus leucocephalus...<br>

I plan to plant a number of boxes in a few days (hopefully) in the Bellingham area, some where there are other boxes (and GeoCaches) already nearby.  You might be interested in them, since there's not a whole lot of boxes up here.<br>
