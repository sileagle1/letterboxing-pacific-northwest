been posted on the National site for those interested.  <br>
<br>
I plan to keep adding to these as time goes by....  Enjoy!  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rood Bridge Park is located in Hillsboro Oregon. From TV Hwy, take <br>
Witch Hazel Road and follow out. Right on River Road, Left on Rood <br>
Bridge Road. Take a hard left at the High School as the road turns <br>
and follow the road closure signs. The park will be on your left <br>
right before the road closure. Please be advised that the park gates <br>
close electronically at dusk, so don't get caught inside!<br>
<br>
I am calling this a collection because I thought, instead of putting <br>
all the boxes out at once, I would make random new additions as I go. <br>
I walk here frequently, so check back, the clues may change and more <br>
boxes will be "released" as time goes by. I have been told there were <br>
boxes here at one point and that they tend to go missing, so some of <br>
these I plant could even become "Limited Editions"! I will however <br>
keep adding more..... <br>
<br>
Most of these are fairly easy paths to follow, being paved and <br>
barked. I have placed all boxes pushing my stroller through them! The <br>
whole thing is approx 2 miles at this time. <br>
<br>
To the boxes:<br>
<br>
Start out at the path through the rhododendron gardens. Stay on the <br>
black top as you head North. When you come to a circle in front of <br>
you, look for the "horse shoe wall". Standing with the wall in front <br>
of you, to your left is a gravel road heading down hill (@350) Take <br>
this path. At the Y, take the road less traveled (N) Walk a ways <br>
enjoying the scenery. Lots of rabbits and wildlife can be seen here. <br>
On a cool day, early morning and evenings you may even catch a <br>
glimpse of the local deer grazing. Eventually you will come to a <br>
bridge. Keeping it to your left continue on at the bend as the path <br>
doubles back. A cluster of trees, a clearing on the right and a <br>
cluster of trees going into the bend. You are close now, approx 15 <br>
steps in and you will see a small log on the right. Carefully lifting <br>
the bark, catch the rabbit before it hops away!<br>
<br>
Continuing on this trail, it will lead you back the way you came, up <br>
the hill and back to the pavement. <br>
<br>
Heading straight on the black top, immediately to the left is another <br>
bark trail, take this, then left into the woods at the blue "S". Got <br>
stump? Continue on, ahead on the right a younger tree with it's <br>
walking stick, it stands in front of another. Between the two lies a <br>
stump, inside you may very well find a shy chipmunk.<br>
<br>
After stamping in, continue on the way you were going... back out to <br>
the pavement. Take a left here, going up, resist the temptaion to act <br>
as a child.... Many can be seen laughing and rolling downhill in the <br>
grass on a hot Summers day. At the next junction, go forward, then <br>
left at the bench. At this point enjoy your walk, a bridge to your <br>
left, your on the right track, up a hill then heading down, At the Y <br>
in the path, choose right. When the paving ends, go right again on to <br>
bark. To your left is a lily pad pond. My daughter loves looking for <br>
frogs here, their little heads, just above the water at the shore <br>
line, all you can see is eyes! You will come to a log across the <br>
path, sit for a while, take a look around, and peek deep inside the <br>
stump at the end, A frog rests, waiting here for you. <br>
<br>
Continue on, back up to the left to the black top path. Go back up <br>
and left at the bench, Left at the Y takes you over a bridge and back <br>
up to the parking lot. <br>
<br>
I hope you have enjoyed your tour, please check back often, as you <br>
never know what creature may pop up weekly in adition here! - - - - - <br>

This promises to be a great collection for what's turning into a <br>
great park!<br>
