                    <div class="plaintext-content">I really like the "Rooster Rock" box.<br/>
There's "Cousins" which was tailored for just such a trip.  As was Horse<br/>
Heaven Hills . . . although you may already have that one if you live in<br/>
Kennewick.<br/>
If you can go off 84, "Fruit Loops" Tour is pretty neat. Especially the<br/>
Panorama box.<br/>
And my guess is that you already heard about the famed "Jay's Tool Box".<br/>
Hope this helps - it's so hard to decide what boxes to look for!<br/>
Have a wonderful trip!<br/>
