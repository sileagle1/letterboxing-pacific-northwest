letterboxing and my love of whippets into two fun-filled days.  <br>
Saturday morning on the way to the first whippet race I stopped and <br>
picked up Turtle Crossing.  (Got to use my new Dauber Duos for the <br>
first time on this box, and I'm hooked!) Then I made a quick stop in <br>
Carver to pick up the Clackamas County Park Series - Sit-A-Spell. <br>
Rounded out my stamping morning with a quick stop in Barton for <br>
another Clackamas County Park Series- Sunrise.<br>
<br>
After a day of racing (my Sophie took 9th and Sleepy Whippet's Raz <br>
took 8th)I invoked the "just one more box" plea to my dogs and <br>
stopped at Metzger park for Bad Baby Sitter.  Just a note to anyone <br>
that's interested in finding this box...the trail is still a mess <br>
from the ice storm.  Lots of big limbs and even a few trees down on <br>
the path.  Be prepared to do a little creative hiking and don't take <br>
a stroller!<br>
<br>
Sunday morning found us in Eagle Fern Park before the oval track <br>
meet.  I took "the girls" out letterboxing with me and decided that <br>
whippets and letterboxing don't mix.  They really hate the walking <br>
slowly and standing around parts.  The first box we found (Morning <br>
Ritual)involved a lot of yanking on the leashes, cursing, tripping, <br>
and a couple of stomped on toes.  On the way to the second box <br>
(Triple Trouble series) I got smart and left the leashes on, but <br>
dropped them and let the dogs roam a little (I was following the <br>
letter of the law if not the whole intent, but we were the only ones <br>
there).  This was just as bad as tripping over them since I had to <br>
constantly keep track of where they were and what they were doing <br>
(eating nasty things of dubious orgins off the ground) and trying to <br>
keep them out of the water.   After the first box of the series they <br>
went back to the car and I finished the series in relative peace.  <br>
Very cute stamps in this series and a nice easy trail (for anyone not <br>
encumbered by 2 whippets).  With 15 minutes to go before racing <br>
started, I hunted down Frank in the Cotton-Tail Rabbit hunt.  He was <br>
a little damp inside but he had a little friend to keep him company.  <br>
I imagine he's pretty lonely now!<br>
<br>
This is a lovely park and well worth the drive.  If you are planning <br>
on going out that way in April oh, say about April 24th & 25, come <br>
watch a race meet!  It's a lot of fun.<br>
