                    <div class="plaintext-content">I made my way outside this chill Central Oregon afternoon. The Three<br/>
Sisters, Mt. Jefferson and Black Butte all showed me their snowy grins<br/>
beneath an azure sky. A fleet of grey-white clouds slipped by<br/>
overhead, hosting a russet-hued hawk on the prowl for an unsuspecting<br/>
meal. It was the perfect time to hide two new letterboxes at Crooked<br/>
River Ranch.<br/>
<br/>
I've been busy over the years populating the Ranch with boxes. Don't<br/>
be shy. C'mon over to the dry side; bundle up and find these newest<br/>
offerings. While you're at it, why not hide one of your own? The motel<br/>
and one of the RV parks at the Ranch are open year round. There are<br/>
three hundred days of sun and few with rain. Enjoy! Funhog<br/>

are there some very nice stamps...but the scenery is spectacular! If any of you get the <br/>
chance to get any of the Crooked River Ranch boxes I would highly recommend them, you <br/>
won't be disappointed. Thanks Funhog for another memorable experience!<br/>
