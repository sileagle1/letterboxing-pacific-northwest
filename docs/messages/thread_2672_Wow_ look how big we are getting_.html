I was just at the beach checking for flood damage and happened to check on Seaside Happiness.  It's alive and well (and dry!) despite nearby flooding.  <br>
<br>
Lucky Lenard is a fun, local series, despite my wandering up a wrong trail.  Great stamps.  Found it myself in September then took my kids out last week so they could enjoy it too.<br>
<br>
By the name, one would assume Lost Letterbox had been found at one point.  Well, I never did. ~  Though the neighbors are very familiar with my face.<br>
<br>
I've been introducing myself to carving with something more advanced than an exacto.  All the frustrations of transfering image have been mine, though I think I've finally figured that out with the help of several sites.  Many missteps later and I might finally have a stamp to plant!<br>
