                    <div class="plaintext-content">When Princess Lea and I went across (I think we took Hwy 539 up out <br/>
of Bellingham--not the busier I-5), I thought I had left my passport <br/>
at home, The Canadian Border guard when we went in gave me a lot of <br/>
grief about not having it...she said that they would let me into <br/>
Canada, but I would have trouble getting back into the US from the US <br/>
officials. Luckily, after much stress and searching of my luggage, I <br/>
found my passport. And I had no problem getting back into the US. <br/>
This is just beefed up security after 9/11. It used to be no big deal <br/>
to go back and forth and they hardly looked at your passport, if at <br/>
all. But Now they definitely pay more attention!<br/>
<br/>
Lea and I were trying to think of all kinds of worse-case scenarios--<br/>
like she would have to drive back to my house and bring my passport <br/>
to me while I waited in Canada!! :-) Or we might have to go to the US <br/>
embassy in Vancouver and try to get them to issue me some sort of <br/>
emergency "hall pass" goodness knows what that would have entailed---<br/>
my mom might have had to fax my birth certificate or something.<br/>
