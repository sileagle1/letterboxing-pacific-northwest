                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the Priest Point Park boxes are all pretty up-to-date as far as status.  Some of the Centennial ones and one of the Nail family's are missing, but they state that in the clues.  The Thanksgiving Day one is the only one people have unexpected problems with.  Still, that leaves you more than 20 boxes in one big, pretty park.  The toughest part is probably where to start!<br/>
<br/>
  This birdwatcher's web site is one of the best for information on how to get there and a sort of map of the park:  http://www.blackhillsaudubon.com/bestplaces/peep.best.priest.htm<br/>

  Welcome to the hobby, and good luck!<br/>
