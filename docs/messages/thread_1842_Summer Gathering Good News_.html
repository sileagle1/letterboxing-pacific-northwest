We now have two, yes two, group camp sites! Someone who wishes to <br/>
remain anonymous has reserved a second group tent site for us (we <br/>
now have A and C). So now we officially have room for 50. If we <br/>
looks like we will go over that we'll figure out a way to deal with <br/>
it - the realistic limiter is probably cars (20 per site) rather <br/>
than people, I doubt they'll be doing a strict count (kids, hide <br/>
your parents in the trunk)! Plus any day use folks don't count <br/>
against the limit.<br/>

Many thanks to our benefactor!<br/>
