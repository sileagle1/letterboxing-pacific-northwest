Baseball Goddess Letterbox <br>
<br>
This box is located in southern Oregon off I-5 going northbound.<br>
<br>
After the #80 (near Glendale, not Cow Creek) exit is the Cow Creek <br>
Rest Area. Park in the southern most <br>
parking spot in the passenger car area. Take the path in front of <br>
you. Walk <br>
past the second picnic table and take the path to the right. After <br>
stepping <br>
over the log, take 60 steps down the path then go left to where the <br>
path <br>
T-intersections with another path that runs along the fence line. <br>
There is <br>
a big tree there. To the right is a bending tree. The box is under <br>
the bend. <br>
***************************************************************<br>
Dig dog LB<br>
 <br>
This box is located on I-5 in Oregon, near Metz Hill. It was placed <br>
12/4/04<br>
<br>
Going northbound on I-5, go to the Cabin Creek Rest Stop. This is the <br>
rest <br>
stop after the 142 Metz Hill exit. From the southern bathroom, take <br>
the <br>
path behind the restrooms downhill. To the right of the trail is a <br>
multitrunked tree family in a cicle. To the left is an out building. <br>
Stand in the path behind the out building with your back to the <br>
restrooms. <br>
Take eight steps to a large tree that will now be to the left of the <br>
multitrunked tree family. The box is under the forest debris behind <br>
the tree. <br>

Bird Dog Letterbox <br>
<br>
<br>
This box is located in Southern Oregon, near Rogue River. (about 20 <br>
miles north of Medford, OR) <br>
<br>
At the Rogue River rest stop lives a whiteish stump, near the river, <br>
in <br>
the picnic area, kinda behind the restrooms. The Bird Dog letterbox <br>
lives in this stump.<br>
<br>
Jett and Pupp hid this box. Jett was very interested in this stump <br>
and <br>
actually put her nose where this box now lives. Jett would have liked <br>
to<br>
have played in the river but it is too rapid and it was too cold!<br>
<br>
Please be discrete and hide this box as you found it or better. There <br>
are <br>
tables near by to stamp in at your leisure.<br>
<br>

Moon Goddess Letterbox <br>
<br>
<br>
This box is located in Oregon, along I-5. (after exit 61)It is near <br>
the town of Hugo in Southern Oregon. <br>
<br>
Going northbound, go to the rest area between Rogue River and Hugo. <br>
Go to <br>
the pet area that is between the parking lot and the freeway. At the <br>
southern most trash cans go south for 21 steps to three trees <br>
together <br>
- one forks close to the ground. The Moon Goddess lives there. <br>
<br>
Please be discrete and hide the moon goddess well when you are done. <br>

Happy Boxing, <br>

But that explains the few boxes over yonder that I suppose are rarely found<br>
since they're not even listed in the region they're in!  We certainly didn't<br>
think of looking in a region we weren't going to!   But an experienced boxer<br>
once told me that there's "no rules to letterboxing".   Reading the yahoo<br>
group it hardly seems true, but it's a wonderful concept so. . . .  to each<br>
their own!  Think outside the box!<br>
<br>

Thought for today: If a letter box in the woods sits and no one stamps in,<br>
is it still a letter box?   :-)   Ok, dumb... it's late.<br>

<br>
Just to elaborate a little about not posting clues in obvious <br>
places...<br>
Not only to make the clues a mystery but also to protect the <br>
letterboxes from repeated vandalism. If the clues are harder to find, <br>
then the repeat offenders are not so apt to take the time to search <br>
out the clues to do their dirty deeds.<br>
Don't beat yourself up about posting the clues. We all make errors <br>
and we live and learn. I'm sure there are no hard feelings. I know <br>
Pupp and I know for a fact that she would not feel badly about this.<br>
Chalk it up to another lesson learned and get out there and box!<br>
