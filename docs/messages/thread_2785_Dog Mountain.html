Why don't you try Hamilton Mountain next time?  I've only had one report<br>
from a finder of "Gorge Panorama" and that was 1.5 years ago.  You can make<br>
it a longer hike if you also want to look for African Safari: Hamilton<br>
Mountain (or perhaps you've already found this?).<br>

Hope all is well with you and your family!<br>

I hiked Dog Mountain today. It was Gorge-ous. The wildflowers are<br>
amazing as usual for this time of year. This has become an annual hike<br>
for me. And there is a plethora of letterboxes up there. I found two<br>
today, I think I have all of them up there now. I highly recommend<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was along for the ride today at Dog Mountain. I have been doing this<br>
hike for at least six years as an annual spring ritual and have to say<br>
that I think this year has the best display of flowers I have seen up<br>
there EVER! We hit it just right, with almost everything making an<br>
appearance: balsamroot, paintbrush, orchids, phlox, larkspur,<br>
chocolate lilies and lupine (in the lower elevations.)If you want to<br>
see one of the most impressive wildflower displays in the area, lace<br>
up those boots and hit the trail NOW. It's a hard one but the reward<br>
is SO  worth it. <br>
<br>
There are at least seven letterboxes up there at this point but plenty<br>
of room for more. Hamilton Mountain would be a wonderful hike too but<br>
I'm saving that one for a different time. It's not known for its<br>
springtime show of wildflowers but the views of the Gorge are stunning<br>
along that trail. I'll make it my mission to visit that Wisconsin<br>
Hiker letterbox this year. I promise! Funhog<br>

Not likely. I think I can count on one hand the number of people<br>
who've found this box. Or at least the number of people who've<br>
*reported* finding the box! ;o)<br>
