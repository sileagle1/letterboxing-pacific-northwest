I can hardly believe it, but apparently an inexperienced letterboxer <br/>
moved my Diamond Lake letterbox to a completely different hiding <br/>
place--somehow they were under the impression that that was the <br/>
point of the game.  I'm happy that they contacted me through the <br/>
LBNA site to let me know (I left plenty of info for new boxers in <br/>
the box), but very disappointed to learn that they left it in a <br/>
VISIBLE place on the Mt. Thielsen trail for "an unsuspecting hiker" <br/>
to discover.  This all took place on August 17--so I realize that <br/>
there's a good chance that an unsuspecting hiker has moved it, taken <br/>
it, or thrown it away as litter by now...it may never be seen again, <br/>
but I guess there's always a chance.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Portland, so maybe someone on this list who's closer to <br/>
Diamond Lake might want to boost their letterboxing karma and do a <br/>
good deed for the Diamond Lake Letterbox.  I'll attach both the <br/>
message I received (with general directions to the new unauthorized <br/>
hiding spot) and my original clues.  If you're headed to Diamond <br/>
Lake/Mt. Thielsen anytime soon, print this out and see if you can <br/>
find it!<br/>
<br/>
If you do try this, please let me know what happens!  Feel free to <br/>
either put it back in its original spot, or hang on to it and mail <br/>
it to me (I'll happily pay postage) so I can rehide it in its real <br/>
spot the next time I'm there--probably next Memorial Day weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you,<br/>

THE NEW "CLUE":<br/>
<br/>
OOPS! we goofed.  After finding the letter box, we did log in and <br/>
write a message but did not return the box to the original place.  <br/>
We didn't know that it must be put back in its original hiding <br/>
spot.  Here is the new place that we put it on Thursday, August 17, <br/>
2005.  We hiked to the top of the foottrail of Mt. Theillsen and on <br/>
the left of the trail placed in the crotch of a three trunk tree.  <br/>
It can be seen by a passer by on the left on the way up the trail, <br/>
but probably not on the way down.  It is about 5-10 minutes from the <br/>
end of the main walk trail before getting to the area that is fairly <br/>
rocky (more technical) and requires a more experienced hiker and <br/>
possibly some equipment.  Please accept our apologies for not <br/>
putting the box back in its original setting.  It was our first time <br/>
discovering something like this and we were kinda excited about the <br/>
notion of rehiding in a new place for an unsuspecting hiker.  We <br/>
love the idea of finding a treasure.  Thank you for starting it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MY ORIGINAL CLUE:<br/>
<br/>
Diamond Lake is a large beautiful lake in Southern Oregon, with <br/>
lovely views of Mt. Thielsen to the east and Mt. Bailey to the west <br/>
(on clear days!).  There are all kinds of fun things to do all year <br/>
round, from backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, tubing and dog <br/>
sledding in the winter to camping, hiking, biking, fishingand now <br/>
letterboxing!in the summer.  ( WINTER WARNING  This box will not be <br/>
accessible in the winter due to the many feet of snow that usually <br/>
fall here!  The best time of year to seek this letterbox will be <br/>
late spring through fall.  If it's early or late in the season, you <br/>
might want to check the snow level before you go!)  ( SUMMER <br/>
WARNING  Watch out for mosquitoes!)<br/>
<br/>
Diamond Lake has an eleven-mile paved bike trail that goes the <br/>
entire way around the lake.  This letterbox is located very close to <br/>
the bike trailbut where!!  Find the spot where the bike trail <br/>
crosses Silent Creek (which flows into Diamond Lake from the south) <br/>
over a cute little wooden bridge.<br/>
<br/>
BIKE IT  You can access the bike trail pretty easily from a number <br/>
of locations around the lake.  Feel free to ride either way, and <br/>
approach the bridge from whatever direction you happen to like.<br/>
<br/>
HIKE IT Unless you're looking for a long walk on a paved trail, <br/>
drive around to the south end of the lake and park at the Silent <br/>
Creek trailhead.  You'll see a dirt trail heading upstream along the <br/>
creek from the parking spaces.  You might want to come back and hike <br/>
this trail after you find the letterbox!  But first, find the paved <br/>
trail which starts across both the road and the creek from the <br/>
parking area.  Take this trail north from the road, along the east <br/>
bank of Silent Creek until the trail intersects with the loop trail <br/>
in a little less than a mile.  You'll see the bike trail crossing <br/>
the bridge to your left.<br/>
<br/>
At the east end of the bridge, take ten steps off the paved trail in <br/>
the direction of the lake (north).  Find a stump and a rock right at <br/>
the base of a tree.  Move the rock to reveal the box.  As always, <br/>
please be very discreet while stamping in because you're so close to <br/>
the trail, seal the baggies and box as tightly as possible to <br/>
protect it from all that winter snow, and make sure you hide the box <br/>
exactly as you found it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy your time at Diamond Lake as much as I do!<br/>

Welcome to the world of being a letterbox-planter-parent!  Sorry that <br/>
it happened.  Hopefully, some caring and conscientous finder retrieved <br/>
it and spared it from the abyss and that the box makes its way back to <br/>
its intended home.<br/>
<br/>
This happens more often than folks realize!  I only wish there were a <br/>
way to preclude this from happening.  :(<br/>
