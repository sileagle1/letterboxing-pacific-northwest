Maybe I spend too much time at the local nature areas watching people show a total disregard for others and the place they are visiting. Maybe I have had dogs since I was a kid and get tired of irresponsible dog owners making a bad name for the rest of us. Maybe I should make some lame excuses too!<br>
<br>
As to you 2 conclusions;<br>
<br>
1. Correct. Was that an apology?<br>
2. If you make lame excuses and break the rules in front of your kids, yes, I think you may be.<br>
3. Duh.<br>
4. You quickly lowered yourself to the same level didn't you. In a flash and you never stopped!<br>
