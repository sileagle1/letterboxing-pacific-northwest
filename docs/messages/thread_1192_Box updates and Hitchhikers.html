In such a short time we've built quite a mound,<br>
of stamps and HH's from all around.<br>
 <br>
Enough of that shtuff.<br>
 <br>
DMS Japanese Garden Box alive and well and looking for visitors, but we don't recommend taking a stroller up the path as one bold boxer has done.<br>
DMS         Cedar Hills Twins are okie dokie.<br>
DMS         PCC Sylvania good to go.<br>
 DMS        Hyland Park - great shape.<br>
DMS         Triple Falls - doing well.<br>
         Marshall Park - fine and dandy.  <br>
         PDX Equus - yup.<br>
         Mudstumpers Mill Mystery - waiting for visitors - it's an easy and short hike!<br>
         <br>
Back to School HH - is moving on<br>
Bindlebabe's HH - is moving on<br>
We found a HH in The Imposter which had not moved since 7/01. It has moved on.<br>
 <br>
I will post details on the hitchhiker page, when I remember to have the info with me when I get online.<br>
