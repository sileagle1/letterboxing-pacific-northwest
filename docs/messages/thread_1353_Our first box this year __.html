  It was such a beautiful day that we decided to head out and attempt <br>
our first letterbox this year. We found the Springwater Trail #1. <br>
Thanks for a great walk and the fun clues. Our kids wanted to go get <br>
the next one,but it was getting late so we will probably head back <br>
out tomorrow night for that one. We are so excited to have so many <br>
new boxes to look for.Maybe one day when life settles down we will <br>
place some boxes. Our kids are really into carving stamps too that <br>
this time they carved their own(with a little help from mom and dad). <br>
We are so excited that we found out about this sport. We love the <br>
hiking and the challenge and especially the great finds. <br>
       Happy hunting everyone<br>
