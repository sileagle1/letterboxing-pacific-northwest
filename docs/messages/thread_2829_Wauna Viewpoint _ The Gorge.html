                    <div class="plaintext-content">I checked on Wauna Viewpoint box today.  It's lonely.... No visitors <br>
since late 2005.  Box in great shape though.  It's a fairly short <br>
hike, about 3 miles round trip, and affords great views of the Gorge, <br>
including Hamilton Mountain, Beacon Rock, the Bridge of the Gods, <br>
Bonneville Dam, Mt. Adams, etc.  Today was cloudy but cool, great <br>
conditions for hiking uphill in the Gorge.  From Portland, head east <br>
on I-84 and take the Eagle Creek exit, just past Bonneville Dam (about <br>
25 minutes).  There is a NW Forest Pass requirement.  Park where ever, <br>
walk across the wooden bridge and follow the signs.  In a few more <br>
weeks, the salmon will be returning to the creek, that's always an <br>
amazing sight.<br>
