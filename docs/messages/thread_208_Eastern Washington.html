things, one being putting a box at Umptanum Falls.  It is a lovely <br/>
hike ( fairly short - about 2 or 3 miles?, fairly level) that is <br/>
through some great upland riparian environment.<br/>
<br/>
It would, likely , only be available during the fine weather as I <br/>
think the high plateau gets snow for the winter making this a no <br/>
winter guarantee spot.<br/>
<br/>
Fudricks box is along the road that goes up to the Falls so I suspect <br/>
that I will have to get cracking and get this box place so folks can <br/>
have a One - Two hit.  I think next weekend looks favorable and <br/>
certainly June is the best of times for this hike.  I have a design <br/>
in mind so it seem a natural.<br/>
<br/>
Keep your options open for both these boxes.<br/>

( I am really supposed to be in the process of moving. I am way ahead <br/>
of schedule so doesn't this sound like a great excuse for getting <br/>
out???)<br/>
