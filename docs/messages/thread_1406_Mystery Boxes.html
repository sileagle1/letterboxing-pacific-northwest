and I decided to attempt yesterday. The clues were awesome but the <br>
stamps and log books were more than awesome. The detail and time that <br>
was put into these stamps were well worth the hunt. People, you <br>
really need to get out and find these boxes! They are really <br>
something that you will want to have in your own letterboxing <br>
journals. Congratulations to the person/people that created these <br>
mystery boxes. You have really outdone yourselves! I wish I could <br>
tell you where they are or who made them but then they wouldn't be a <br>
mystery now would they?<br>
Happy Hunting!<br>
