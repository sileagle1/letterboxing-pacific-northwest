                    <div class="plaintext-content">After braving the icy stretches of Hwy 26 over Mt Hood, we spent the weekend in <br>
Central OR. The thick layer of snow that has been blanketing the area was finally <br>
gone. It was cold and clear, the perfect weather for letterboxing. I finally tracked <br>
down Cline Falls version deux and must admit that this stamp is worlds nicer than the <br>
long, lost original. It's only a pity that the first one went missing and that it isn't <br>
around for folks to see Carie's carving progress! I had always wanted to figure out <br>
how to get a good view of the falls and this trek showed me.<br>
<br>
I then went to Redmond Dry Canyon to track down the Redmond Redhawk box. I love <br>
hiking this canyon, especially when it's cool. Unfortunately, the promised ostriches <br>
along the way were in hiding but I did see a harrier and several flights of geese. I <br>
wandered around for quite a while in the vicinity of this sneeky box but was finally <br>
rewarded for my persistence with a lovely little stamp by John Fleshman in my log.<br>
<br>
Sunday morning, I met with Birder to tour the lovely sewage ponds in Redmond, hand <br>
over some Mastercarve and to exchange signature stamps. The local residents at the <br>
ponds included three bald eagles. During our travels looking for other feathered <br>
friends, we went to Phoebe Pond in search of owls. Along the way, I succeeded in <br>
finding the elusive Phoebe Pond #3 box. Having the box's creator laugh at you while <br>
you hunt their box always adds an extra element of fun, doesn't it? Birder has grand <br>
plans for many more letteboxes in the region. I'm looking forward to exploring some <br>
of the interesting places they will be hidden.<br>
