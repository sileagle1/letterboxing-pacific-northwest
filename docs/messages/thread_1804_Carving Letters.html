My biggest issue with carving letters is remembering to be in <br/>
reverse!  Wasted lots of pink stuff along the way.  That resolved my <br/>
next tip is - make the lettering a segment of the stamp that can be <br/>
carved separately so you aren't wasting lots of pink stuff or the <br/>
design portion.  Then glue the design and letter portions to one <br/>
backing.  I also find that negative carving is by far the easiest, <br/>
but I have posted elsewhere about using a stencil cutter - just like <br/>
a regular xacto but narrower blade/slimmer holder.  The narrow blade <br/>
allows for tighter turns in the rubber for those inside o's a's d's.  <br/>
Good luck.<br/>

The only time my letters look halfway decent is when I do them using a laser printed <br/>
transfer of a large, bold font. I am unable to create clean enough letters freehand. <br/>
This is definitely one of the major challenges! Bon Chance...Funhog<br/>

I have had some success by using Microsoft Word program, and using <br/>
either Arial Black or Blackadder ITC in Caps only and in either size <br/>
22 or 24. Anything smaller and I can't do it.<br/>
I also use Speedball nib #1 that has been squeezed thinner with vise <br/>
grips. Then I sharpen the nib very well. Sharpening during your <br/>
carving will help keep the image sharper. This seems to work with PZ <br/>
Kut, but I don't know about the pink stuff.<br/>

I find MS Word's Impact or Rockwell Extra Bold font's in 'bold' seem <br/>
to work well for lettering.  The trick is using the biggest font <br/>
size you can get away with for your image.  I either 'iron it on' or <br/>
transfer it using acetone and then outline the letters with a tiny <br/>
Xacto knife and then 'clear the debris' with the Speedball carving <br/>
tool's smallest tip (I think it's a #1 size).  Also, I've found that <br/>
a tiny Exacto knife (I found a 'retractable' micro- Xacto knife for <br/>
sale with extra blades at Home Depot of all places--just hanging <br/>
around one of the ends of an aisle for a couple of bucks) is really <br/>
worth it in helping giving you the 'detail' around the letters--<br/>
without removing crucial bits of carving medium.  I've also <br/>
experimented with other fonts over time (for mostly non-letterboxing <br/>
related stamps--including Old English, Gothic, Algerian and some of <br/>
the others.  Those take a LOT more time &amp; patience (something I <br/>
basically lack at the moment).<br/>

Wow, I never thought of the super simple idea of using computer <br/>
created texts and fonts for lettering... I actually tried drawing <br/>
words freeheand which was very frustrating, especially when carving <br/>
my Babyfoot Lake LB and realized after stamping my finished carving <br/>
that I had forgotten the all important reversing step!! Of course I <br/>
had to carve a whole new stamp.... well its not a total loss, its <br/>
what i do on nights of insomnia. <br/>
<br/>
Funhog: I must argue with your opinion that you have trouble doing <br/>
clean carving of letters (well you might, but it doesnt appear so). <br/>
Your lettering on a certain mystery box off of I-5, exit 61, had <br/>
beautiful lettering and when I found it I was amazed at the clarity <br/>
of your carving and a bit envious too... but I guess that comes with <br/>
time, I am relatively new to LBing, only been at it for a year and <br/>
havent carved enough stamps yet, maybe I will get better at it <br/>
someday :o) <br/>
