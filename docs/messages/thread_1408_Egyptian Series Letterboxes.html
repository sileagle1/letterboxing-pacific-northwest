and hoping that it is! LOL) or elsewhere???<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid the letter boxing page just confused me... I know there are some <br/>
letter boxes around my area (Aloha), but can't figure out which ones they <br/>
are... I didn't see them in the Beaverton ones... and there were so many <br/>
Portland ones that I didn't have time to check them all...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter got me turned on to this sport/game? And we found a couple of <br/>
the PCC Rockcreek boxes.  That was a lot of fun!<br/>

&gt;For those of you who have box #1 &amp; #2 you may want to go back again<br/>

Replied to this earlier thinking it was a personal e-mail from you, so<br/>
I deleted it, but thanks for letting US know about the retirement of<br/>
these boxes.  I had them on my list, sorry I will not get to see them. <br/>
