this and I would be shocked if it was gone!!!!  If you face the fish <br/>
sculpture  the "rocks" are just to your right, in the cluster of <br/>
rocks in the center of the walkway.  There are two rocks that have a <br/>
opening where your hand will fit into, the box is tucked nicely in <br/>
the crevice!!!!! If you are looking in other rocks, you are trying <br/>
too hard.  It is so close it could bite you!!!!!  Yes it is right in <br/>
the middle of everything, and that is what is cool to me !!!!  I <br/>
will have to get back there soon and check it, maybe it is gone, but <br/>
couldn't imagine it missing, it is way out of sight!!!!<br/>
