We were flabbergasted to find the Museum, Zoo, and all surrounding areas buried under 4 inches of ice and snow.  The kids had a great time at the museum and I couldn't let the chance to find a box go by.  So I grabbed my bag out of the car and followed the clues to look for Puff the Magic Dragon.  After a sudden inspiration last night, the clues led right to the poor cold dragon.  I warmed him up between my numb hands  (silly dragon wouldnt't even warm them up for me) before returning him to his VERY icy hiding space.  <br>
<br>
It was cold enough that I wasn't going to attempt the rest of the series but was very happy to find one box!<br>

<br>
Glad to hear you found Puff and the the Mighty Dragon has not ceased <br>
his fearless roar just yet.  I do hope you get time to go back for <br>
