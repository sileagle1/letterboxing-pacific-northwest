please sign up at Atlas Quest <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=796.<br>
<br>
I spoke to the owners of the Malt Shop and Grill today and they let me <br>
know that if we have 40 people coming, they will need to know this so <br>
they can provide for us another cook and more waitresses to accomodate <br>
the larger crowd. At the moment we have 31 people signed up to attend. <br>
This is another reason why signing up for an event is very important if <br>
you plan on attending. <br>
<br>
Thank you and I hope to see you all there!<br>
