<br>
Went out to Milo McIver this evening to scope out the camping area and<br>
plant a couple letterboxes.  One of the letterboxes is pretty close to<br>
camp, the other is far, far away down at the other end of the park where<br>
there are a bunch of picnic areas and a gravel boat ramp.  Both<br>
letterboxes have VERY EASY clues (at least I hope so) and are right<br>
along the trail.   <br>
<br>
Went out yesterday and got the pinatas and some stuff to put in them for<br>
Sunday morning's Sock-it-to-the-papier-mache adventure.  <br>
<br>
If anyone is interested in taking photos at the gathering and posting<br>
them to the website, be my guest.  I have no digital camera or computer<br>
to do the techie stuff, so it will be up to someone else to record this<br>
fabulous event.<br>
<br>
The clutch on my truck has decided to say sayonara, but worry not.  I<br>
believe a knight in shining armour with a dark blue jeep will whisk me<br>
to the gathering!<br>
<br>
P.S.  Ryan, please get yo' butt off the AT, onto a plane, and over to<br>
this gathering!!!  We miss you!!!  <br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>
