                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey All!<br>
<br>
Thanks to a certain slab of bacon we all know and love we are set to<br>
have our Portland area gathering at Milo McIver State Park in Estacada,<br>
Oregon.  <br>
<br>
We've got Group Camp H2 and, per Funhog,  the name it's under is "Rubber<br>
Stamp Camp Out".  We've got the group camp for Friday, July 11th from<br>
4:00 pm that day to Sunday, July 13th at 1:00 pm, I believe.  This is a<br>
tent area that can take 25 campers.  It ought to be lots of fun and even<br>
though Ryan says that camping is overrated, I bet it will be just fine<br>
and dandy for us all on that weekend. <br>
<br>
The camping facility is paid for.  Just bring yourr fine selves and all<br>
the food and drink you can pack with you!  For those not camping there<br>
is a Day Use Fee of, I believe $3.00.  Campers can just tell them at the<br>
booth that they are part of the Rubber Stamp Camp Out at H2 and you<br>
shouldn't have to pay to get in at all.<br>
<br>
So there's the latest. Please use a search engine to look up Oregon<br>
State Park's website which has details about the park itself and<br>
directions that will take you straight there.  This is going to be a<br>
great time!!!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>

You have been on the board 2 times but you have not updated your journal since May 20th.  What's up with that?  It's like a series, and the next volume is late!  It's like a cup of coffee in the morning, ya gotta have it or you cannot function properly!           <br>

We'll be thinking of you at the gathering and wishing you were there.<br>
And when you return to the Rose City we will just have to hold a "Green<br>
Turtle" gathering in your honor.<br>
