I heard that he even stamped some stamps all by himself.  Amazing & <br>
there wasn't even any fishing there to entice him.  Way to go <br>
Adventure Seeker.  =-)  I'm sorry I missed out on all the fun.  I'm <br>
glad that J-Bear was there and I'm excited to see the stamps he has <br>
that I don't-truly a MIRACLE.  =-)  <br>
<br>
Yay too that he met you Sleepy Whippet & Book Worm.  So fun that you <br>
made it up there.  =-)  Not too many people get J-Bear's stamp <br>
without me right there beside him.  =-)  I'm so impressed. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep, I witnessed J-Bear stamping his stamp into other letterboxers' <br>
books with my very own eyes. He even captured a few stamps in his <br>
own journal, as well. It's true & it was an incredible vision!!! It <br>
definitely made a lasting impression on me!  --a little stamping <br>
humour injected here-- <br>
<br>
I think he even enjoyed hanging out with the 30 or so other <br>
letterboxers at the event although I'm unable to verify <br>
his 'official' reaction to the event now that he's had a few hours <br>
to let it sink in!  ;)  Funny thing was, he even knew a few of the <br>
boxers already, had even exchanged signature stamps with them <br>
previously!!!  I heard he even found a letterbox or 2 in the process <br>
before he had to skedaddle out to Yakima...<br>
