April Fools is being checked on - seems to be missing in action<br/>
<br/>
Department of Redundancy Department - very clever, well chosen <br/>
location and lots of fun, And large big stamp. Come prepared with <br/>
lots of ink and a big ink pad!<br/>
<br/>
Perseus is wonderful well placed, alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Duck Pond Friends Series<br/>
#1 Turtle Island - great stamp and location!<br/>
<br/>
#2 Duck Pond - stamp is missing thanks to one of the mudstumpers <br/>
(me).  I dropped it off a nearby bridge (not into water but into <br/>
bushes and of course there are blackberry vines there too).  45 <br/>
minutes later darkness descended and alas no stamp.  We didn't even <br/>
get to properly stamp in.  The box owner has been notified. We will <br/>
if need be continue to search for it, however we cannot get back over <br/>
there until next week.<br/>
<br/>
We are thrilled to be letterboxers and excited about all the new <br/>
places to visit.  CCC Environmental Learning Center is fabulous!<br/>
<br/>
Great locations, great stamps, and great thanks to all box placers.<br/>
<br/>
PS. we do not intend to be problems - such as opening boxes on a <br/>
bridge, I promise not to do that again!<br/>
<br/>
thanks again<br/>
