wonderful this time of year, even (if not especially) on a rainy day<br>
like today.  It is so quiet and peaceful there.  I went to replace a<br>
cracked box and baggies with holes for my letterbox there this<br>
afternoon and enjoyed my little hike more than usual.  There are at<br>
least two other boxes there, so those of you who haven't gotten them<br>
all should make time to visit.  You may even see our PNW mascot there<br>
if you look closely - there is a sign that designates a banana slug<br>
crossing.  The garden's web site has been updated and tells all about<br>
the events and tours available.  www.leachgardens.org<br>
