There's poison oak out there, but it's not all that common.  It took <br>
me several months of hiking when I first moved out before I spotted <br>
it.  Out here, it's usually in sunny areas like meadows and other <br>
clearings.  If you're hiking through forests, it's very unlikely <br>
you'll spot some, and most of the hiking trails around here are in <br>
forests.  =)<br>
<br>
In California, the opposite is true.  Poison oak is more often found <br>
in the shade--especially near creeks and other water sources.<br>
<br>
Just learn to identify it so you know what not to touch.  There a <br>
picture I took of some at <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/glossary/p.html along with a wordy <br>
description of what you should look for.<br>
<br>
Poison ivy is generally an east-coast thing, though it has many <br>
similarities to poison oak.<br>
