I just wanted to take a moment and let all of our friends here know that, in a small home ceremony on March 6th, 2004, I'll be making an honest woman out of RayvenMom!  Yes, it's true.  We'll be getting married on Sat, in the afternoon, having a small ceremony, nothing fancy and then off to Las Vegas for the honeymoon!<br>
<br>
Now, imagine if you can.... This will be my 4th (Yes, you read it right, fourth) time at the alter and her 2nd.  Imagine how much it took her to get me there! (grin).<br>
<br>
We just wanted to share this with our friends here.<br>
<br>
Steve of Rayvenhaus<br>
