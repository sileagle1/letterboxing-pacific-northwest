                    <div class="plaintext-content">Haven't found any 'inexpensive' sources for small, unlined notepads--<br/>
unless you make them yourself.  I've used logbooks that run the <br/>
gamut from cutting small, memo notepads in half or thirds; cutting <br/>
thin long strips of heavier weight printer paper, stacking them, <br/>
folding in half and stapling the top (usually the ones I put in the <br/>
film canister LBs), unlined index cards cut in half/thirds--holes <br/>
punched in top and looped together with a metal 'binder clip' ring <br/>
or tied together with some sort of fastener, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Some artistic folks (a group of which I am NOT a member) make their <br/>
own absolutely gorgeous logbooks--finding 'how to' instructions at <br/>
various websites on the 'net--using card stock, bookbinding thread, <br/>
craft papers, etc.  I totally lack those skills/patience so haven't <br/>
even tried the 'professional' looking logbooks.  Also, IKEA has some <br/>
really neat tiny logbooks these days--I think they run about 4-6 in <br/>
a pack for about $1--what I'm not sure is if they're unlined or <br/>
not.  I think they may be lined, though.  <br/>
<br/>
I really haven't worried about the 'unlined' vs ruled issue in boxes <br/>
I placed (I presume because they go missing so often) except when it <br/>
comes to our personal logbook we carry on our various treks.  I <br/>
learned the hard way after using a ruled journal style book as our <br/>
first logbook--not only was it ruled but I stamped on both sides of <br/>
the pages--something, upon reflection, I wish I hadn't done.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see your new boxes in the area!<br/>

You're much too hard on yourself, Bethany!  I've seen some of your <br/>
stamps, and they're PHENOMINAL!!!!  If you can make stamps that <br/>
good, you can certainly do a good job with logbooks.  Although, <br/>
admittedly, the *desire* to do really elaborate logbooks has to be <br/>
there as well, which is another issue.  But at least nobody seems to <br/>
care if someone actually uses store-bought logbooks, so you're safe <br/>
on that count.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
But back to cheap, small logbooks....  I found some that I really <br/>
liked at the Dollar Store once upon a time (an excellent source for <br/>
all sorts of cheap letterboxing stuff), although they were lined, so <br/>
they wouldn't have fit your purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, making them yourself is the cheapest method I know <br/>
of.  They don't have to be professional or elaborate like some <br/>
people like to do, and there are a number of sources online you can <br/>
search for for ideas.<br/>
<br/>
If you can hold on for a couple of months, just yesterday I started <br/>
working on my very own bookmaking tutorial meant especially for <br/>
letterboxers.  But it'll probably be a couple of months before I get <br/>
it online.  (I've got a lot of tutorials I'm working on, this is <br/>
just one of several.)<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for your kind comments.  I guess Lemony Snicket &amp; I have a <br/>
LOT in common.  ;)  Although, I prefer to maintain a more positive <br/>
outlook on life than does our narrator friend!  Yes, I've never been <br/>
too keen on putting much effort into my logbooks--the one or two <br/>
times I really went above &amp; beyond my standard logbooks, the <br/>
letterboxes either went missing right away (Yashiro Pagoda LB--<br/>
multiple times in its case) or nobody ever bothered to seek out that <br/>
particular letterbox (Wright LB) during its 'lifetime'.  Personally, <br/>
I prefer to spend more mental energy and physical effort on the <br/>
stamp and especially moreso researching, entwining history with <br/>
hints aka 'wordcrafting' the clues.  <br/>
<br/>
DEEP THOUGHTS ON CLUE WRITING (not by jack handey)?: However, most, <br/>
if any, feedback I get to the clues I write/letterboxes we place <br/>
tends to lean toward the negative, so I wonder if writing more <br/>
straightforward clues is what most people prefer (or if people are <br/>
just more inclined to comment on letterboxes when they feel <br/>
something is 'out of whack' with the clues/trail/indicators/LB, <br/>
etc)?  But, alas, don't hold your breath waiting for easier clues to <br/>
appear for most of our boxes--I don't plan on going that route. The <br/>
mystery, challenge &amp; exploring something new is what most appeals to <br/>
me about letterboxing in the first place!!! I do plan, however, to <br/>
modify many of our existing boxes' clues to improve/tweak (not <br/>
simplify) them someday soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Amidst our current 'instant gratification type of a culture', I tend <br/>
to like to challenge folks' thought processes with the clues, giving <br/>
children &amp; adults alike an opportunity to think (sometimes outside <br/>
the box), solve simple puzzles, and possibly learn some local <br/>
history or gain a greater appreciation for something they otherwise <br/>
would never explore in the process of seeking out a particular <br/>
letterbox we place.  Hopefully, that's what we've accomplished with <br/>
many of our letterboxes out and about.<br/>
<br/>
LOGBOOK IDEAS:  <br/>
<br/>
1. Another idea for inexpensive unlined notebooks are those 'chunky' <br/>
prebound memo books you can get from paper/school supply aisles of <br/>
stores like Rite Aid, Walgreen's, K-Mart, Wally World (W-M), etc.  <br/>
They're about 2" x 2" x 1" and usually have some wacky 'kids' <br/>
cartoon characters on the cover like powerpuff kids or speed racer, <br/>
stuff like that.  Some are just blank, bright colors with 'Mead' <br/>
stamped on it somewhere.  They run about $1 - $2 each and you can <br/>
easily cover them with contact paper or decoupage, duct tape, camo <br/>
tape--something like that.  The nice thing about them, though, is <br/>
they've got about 100 pages in them--so 200 sides of pages for <br/>
stamping in!  The bad thing about them, though, is that they're <br/>
fairly thick and don't fit in many 'smaller' type letterbox <br/>
containers.  If you're lucky, sometimes you can find these in the <br/>
clearance section of these stores.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Another type of letterboxing logbook I've come across frequently <br/>
are those spiral bound index card 'books'--folks carefully remove <br/>
the metal spine from it by 'unwinding' it from the pages, cut the <br/>
pages in half and/or break the pages up into 2-4 piles, cut <br/>
the 'spine' in half, carefully rethread the two spines through the <br/>
holes in the piles of the index cards.  It looks very professional <br/>
and you can even add nice 'covers' to your front page by simply <br/>
punching holds in the top of some cardstock/cardbook and rethreading <br/>
them in with the other pages.  I guess this is hard to describe <br/>
online but it's easier to follow if you see one out there--worst <br/>
case, just study a spiral bound notebook you have lying around, <br/>
imagine cutting it in half and the concept should come to you after <br/>
a while.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see folks on the trails soon!  Until then, we languish in <br/>
life's chaos...<br/>

<br/>
I think you might be right on both counts.  Last week I actually got <br/>
an e-mail from someone who seemed FURIOUS at me for not just saying <br/>
where one of my walking tour boxes was.  All that jumping through <br/>
hoops and such--didn't want no part of that.  It was kind of funny, <br/>
in a sad sort of way, and I tried to explain that my walking tour <br/>
boxes weren't meant to be drive-bys.  Anyone finding them should <br/>
expect to WORK for it!<br/>
<br/>
But if you look at the boxes that tend to get the most visitors--<br/>
it's the easy drive bys that require little or no hiking and nothing <br/>
but straight-foward clues.  There's nothing wrong with that (despite <br/>
e-mails of fury when I don't follow such conventions!), but I expect <br/>
to lose a certain percentage of the 'letterboxing audience' when I <br/>
don't write clues for the lowest common denominator.  Each box has <br/>
an intended audience--whether implied or otherwise.  Some people, I <br/>
think, forget that any given box is not meant for everyone, and they <br/>
are the ones most likely to complain about not liking a particular <br/>
style of clue or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
But then, who cares?  If somebody doesn't like a particular style of <br/>
clue, they shouldn't go looking for that box in the first place.  <br/>
Give 'em hell, Bethany!  ;o)<br/>

Well I think it depends on your preference.  You are talking about the <br/>
journal pads that are left in the boxes, right?  Well I just started making <br/>
my own, cutting the paper to whatever size will fit best and then using a <br/>
brad to hold them together...  I'm sure others have better ideas than I do, <br/>
but that's the most inexpensive way I've found...<br/>

Best source I've found for unlined CHEAP log books is Oriental Trading<br/>
Company. You can find them online and with a $20 order you'll have more<br/>
journals than you can possibly use.  I've ordered twice, and now have<br/>
about 20 different style log books ready to be used.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I ordered a bunch of those exactly design your own notebooks.. They are<br/>
lined, but they are perfect for letterboxing.  You can stamp your own image<br/>
on the front of the book and there you go. And those are spendier than a lot<br/>
of the other notebooks.<br/>
<br/>
You might want me think about getting together with other people in your<br/>
area and ordering together.. most of the things come in 2 - 6 dozen.... I<br/>
ordered a bunch and use them as thank you gifts to other letterboxers :)<br/>
<br/>
I also like the different shapes they come in.<br/>
<br/>
There's some little bitty tiny ones that work even in microboxes.<br/>
