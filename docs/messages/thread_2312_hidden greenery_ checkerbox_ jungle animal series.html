Would you tell me what time you were there?  If you pulled the box<br/>
it's possible (although not likely) it wasn't there when I looked.  I<br/>
was there yesterday too.  There was an art sale going on at a house on<br/>
one of the corners formed by the streets, lots of people coming and<br/>
going.  I really don't have a good answer for if someone asks me what<br/>
I'm doing poking around in the trees (funhog - if you were boxing<br/>
alone what were you going to say if someone asked you?).  The one<br/>
place I thought looked like a likely spot a squirrel might put<br/>
something (that I could reach) was empty - that's why I wonder what<br/>
time you were there and if you pulled the box to log in.  I have to go<br/>
back to that neighborhood this afternoon, and now I'm intrigued.<br/>

I saw the art sale and can tell you that you were close.  The squirrell <br/>
could likely jump from the art sale to the box within a few trees.<br/>
