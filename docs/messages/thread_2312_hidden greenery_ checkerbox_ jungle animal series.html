Would you tell me what time you were there?  If you pulled the box<br>
it's possible (although not likely) it wasn't there when I looked.  I<br>
was there yesterday too.  There was an art sale going on at a house on<br>
one of the corners formed by the streets, lots of people coming and<br>
going.  I really don't have a good answer for if someone asks me what<br>
I'm doing poking around in the trees (funhog - if you were boxing<br>
alone what were you going to say if someone asked you?).  The one<br>
place I thought looked like a likely spot a squirrel might put<br>
something (that I could reach) was empty - that's why I wonder what<br>
time you were there and if you pulled the box to log in.  I have to go<br>
back to that neighborhood this afternoon, and now I'm intrigued.<br>

.even if I did have hte stamp & log you still would've found an empty <br>

I saw the art sale and can tell you that you were close.  The squirrell <br>
could likely jump from the art sale to the box within a few trees.<br>
