                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't know if anyone has noticed yet, but under the "Links" section <br>
I created a folder called "Clues, clues, clues!"  (I'm so creative. <br>
*smile*)<br>
<br>
At the moment, only the clue for Wendy's orphaned Tryon Creek <br>
Letterbox is there since the link from the main website doesn't work <br>
and she's a hard person to get ahold of unless you happen to have her <br>
e-mail address in your address book.  (Most of us don't, though.)<br>
<br>
But anyhow--if there's ever a clue for a letterbox you don't want <br>
posted on the main letterboxing website in fear that the National <br>
Park Service or some other authority figures might pull it (the <br>
Powell's box would have been a good candidate), let me know and I'll <br>
include a link there to your clue so everyone can find it relatively <br>
easily.  Kind of the "hidden clues" in the letterboxing world that <br>
aren't meant to be widely dissimminated.<br>
<br>
Speaking of hard to find clues--Bill, where's your website?!  =)  I <br>
still want to add it to the links section if you don't mind!  (I saw <br>
you sneak onto the board--I know you're here....)<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
