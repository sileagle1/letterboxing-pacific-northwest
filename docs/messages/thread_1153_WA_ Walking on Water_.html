<br>
Anyhow, I just wanted to let everyone in the Seattle area know that <br>
this is a REALLY cool box!  The walk has beautiful views (just ignore <br>
the traffic nearby, the only bad part of the box), but it is such a <br>
great walk!  And the box has such a cute stamp carved by the Amazing <br>
Bethany!<br>
<br>
Thanks for box!  I haven't enjoyed myself on a 'hike' that much in <br>
awhile!  =)<br>
