                    <div class="plaintext-content">First I would like to send my thanks to Funhog and Legerdemaine for <br/>
the really nice Aloha stamps (Manu Make) on the Valley Isle - <br/>
beautiful hike!<br/>
<br/>
And in the spirit of the islands a new green turtle has been born, <br/>
albeit not "the" green turtle.<br/>
<br/>
I have left a new LB - "wikiwiki honu" in South of Maui.  It is <br/>
appropriately named as it resides in a high-traffic area - although <br/>
a nice little turtle it may quickly disapear. <fingers-crossed>. The <br/>
clues have been posted.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the positioning of wikiwiki honu is to allow for a <br/>
quick stop-n-find on the way to/from one of Funhogs 'royal' boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If you make it to the the Islands this year be sure to make time for <br/>
Funhogs 'Manu Make'.  It is a great hike, schedule part of the day <br/>
for paragliding on the same mountain, take some layers (the temp had <br/>
a 20degree swing from bottom to top the day I was there).<br/>
<br/>
Happy LB'ing!<br/>
