                    <div class="plaintext-content">In the past two days, I've had the delight of tracking down some newly <br>
planted boxes.   Many thanks to   Pupp and Smiley for the fun!   Yowza--how can each <br>
of them carve so much better than I do with so much less practice???   Fun <br>
clues, great stamps--check 'em out, folks!<br>
<br>
I had the added pleasure of MEETING Smiley and two of her kids, as they were <br>
surreptiously seeking one of Pupp's Lbs.   I'd already found it, unaware that <br>
these lbers were hot in pursuit behind me!   I'd taken a little walk, and in <br>
wandering back where the box was hidden, I detected in these strangers the <br>
tell-tale signs of fellow boxers (a certain nonchalance, a clutching of certain <br>
downloaded pages...) and couldn't help but greet them with, "I got firsties."   <br>
What a fun visit! <br>
<br>
Today Heather and I were recalling our concern (when we first started boxing) <br>
that at the voracious, obsessive rate we were seeking the local boxes, we <br>
would soon run out of ones to seek!   Man, look at that Portland list now!   Who <br>
can keep up?   (Besides Funhog, of course...)   ;o)<br>
<br>
Welcome new boxers, and THANKS for planting!<br>
