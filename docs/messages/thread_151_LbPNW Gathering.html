everyone else.  Any opportunity to head up there is a welcome one as far<br/>
as I'm concerned.  Can Canada Goose and The Secret Gardeners host and<br/>
get it together?  If so, I'm more than willing to let them handle a<br/>
summer gathering and I can host a Fall or Winter one for Ryan's return<br/>
here in Portland.  How does that sound to everyone?  I may even have<br/>
incentive to stay at the Secret Gardeners'  Bed &amp; Breakfast in Langley!<br/>
Sounds terrific!!!  I look forward to everyone's thoughts.<br/>

Milo McIver the weekend of July 12-13, and I certainly wouldn't mind<br/>
that.  Perhaps The Secret Gardners and Canada Goose can also hold one<br/>
this summer in June or August.  <br/>
<br/>
Since we have people eager for that weekend and that park why don't we<br/>
just TENTATIVELY  say we're going to do it?  I vote for Sunday, the<br/>
13th, that way the Nail Family may be able to make it.  There's no rule<br/>
that says we can't have multiple gatherings, as A Rose says.  I can't<br/>
recall ever being in that park, myself, but it sounds like a hit.  John<br/>
has been there and says it's good.  People at my job love it there and<br/>
my brother has camped there before, so it's obviously a nice park.   <br/>
<br/>
I don't know the details about reserving picnic shelters, etc., but I'll<br/>
find out.  What say y'all?!!!<br/>

I've got nothing currently on my calendar for July 12-13--either/both is fine <br/>
with me.  Milo McIver is also fine with me, especially if I've not yet found <br/>
the Royal Angler--Funhog will be onsite to clarify direction.  (If those <br/>
dates don't work at that park, Hopkins Memorial might be available that <br/>
weekend--I'd have to check--and people could camp there, for free.)<br/>
