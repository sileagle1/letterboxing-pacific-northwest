this morning and hit boxes out in Yacolt and then headed out to Wake Robin<br/>
for the event.  What a wonderful event and a wonderful group of people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome again to the new comers - way to go guys you found some hard boxes!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was a joy to see you again Paisley Orca - you just always seem to keep<br/>
everyone smiling and was nice to see that quite guy that tags along with you<br/>
as well. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ryan - as always it was a barrel of laughs, I will never get over the image<br/>
of you falling backwards down a hill with your legs up like a turtle and<br/>
having to take off your pack to get up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bethany it was a pleasure as always! You are one addicted letter boxer lady!<br/>
Just out of surgery and out boxing! I admire that!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bret - it was a joy, you so remind me of one of "the good old boys" Sort of<br/>
like Bo and Luke Duke - I might have to carve the General Lee in your honor<br/>
someday, it was so nice getting to know you a bit, and I look forward to<br/>
seeing you again soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Patrick - what a nice surprise to meet you, I hope to meet you on the trails<br/>
again someday!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charlie - You amaze me still! You are a trooper and your enthusiasm and love<br/>
for this hobby is admired by Iron`Bear and I.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dave  - Was great seeing you again - and what a surprise to learn you are<br/>
related to Celt!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Camp Fire Lady and Cats Meow - I just love you guys! Thanks for going with<br/>
us today; it always makes things twice as fun to have our good friends<br/>
along.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Funhog - What can I say? Thank you for organizing such a wonderful event and<br/>
for all the things you have taught me recently.  I'll buy dinner anytime<br/>
your teaching!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope I didn't miss anyone, if I did it is completely unintentional and I<br/>
apologize.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A special thank you to Fudrick for carving the wonderful event stamp - I<br/>
wish you could have been there; it is always nice to see you! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And last but not least Thanks to all those that planted boxes for the event<br/>
- what a wonderful collection of talented carvers and wonderful stamps in<br/>
one place. Anyone that hits this area should consider themselves very lucky<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Time for me to put my feet up and get some rest!!!<br/>
<br/>
13 hours and 20 boxes! What a day!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you all the best,<br/>
<br/>

if several of them were actually hand carved and she's not easy to <br/>
impress. And the handmade logbooks - wow! I should have taken the <br/>
class. Folks that haven't seen these yet are in for a treat!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing some stamps from the newbies, you show good <br/>
promise. <br/>

The Bo and Luke thing is pretty funny as the Dukes of Hazzard (first <br/>
season) was filmed in my home town. As was the entire run of In the <br/>
Heat of the Night (TV, not movie) and parts of various other stuff. <br/>
Cooter from the Dukes was actually my congressman for a while!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you Funhog for coordinating such a wonderful event. Cat's Meow <br/>
and I had a great time finding these awesome stamps! I am very <br/>
honored to have these stamps in my logbook from some very talented <br/>
carvers.<br/>
Thank you also Funhog for teaching the classes at the Recreation <br/>
Center. I have walked away with some new techniques that I am sure <br/>
will improve my carving skills and I have been so inspired by what <br/>
you have taught me. I am so excited to start binding my own logbooks!<br/>
The next time you would like to teach a class I encourage everyone to <br/>
attend. Even if you have been letterboxing before. Funhog, I am so <br/>
impressed by you.<br/>
It was so nice to see everyone again and to meet some new faces. <br/>
Ryan, thanks for the laughs and Charlie it is always a pleasure to <br/>
letterbox with you.<br/>
Thank you Pandora and Iron Bear for showing us how to get to the park <br/>
and letting Cat's Meow and I tag along with you. You are always the <br/>
best people to letterbox with. Thank you my friends.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was bummed that we missed the Wake Robin event. It sounds like <br/>
everyone had a great time. <br/>
We were capming at Fort Stevens State Park near Astoria for a few <br/>
days and we were having so much fun that we stayed an extra day, <br/>
which didn't get us back home in time for the event. We did find a <br/>
few boxes while we were at the coast though. The Coffenberry Lake <br/>
box was fun. We had our raft all ready to row out to an island, but <br/>
the oars were in the roof box on the top of my car and I lost the <br/>
keys. It was not a good thing, since a bunch of our stuff neeeded to <br/>
go in it when we packed up to leave, and it was very tight squeezing <br/>
everything into the car. We were right there and I wasn't going to <br/>
let not having any oars stop us from getting out there to find that <br/>
box. It was a beautiful day yesterday and there were many people at <br/>
the lake. I ended up asking some people that had a smaller raft if <br/>
we could borrow their oars. It was a bit of a task rowing with their <br/>
oars, they were a bit small for our raft, but we made it and stamped <br/>
in. We also found Horsin' Around Seaside and Picea Sitchensis. If <br/>
you haven't been to Fort Stevens I highly recommend it, we had a <br/>
blast.<br/>
<br/>
Can Miller and Hutch e-mail me off the list please, or can someone <br/>
get me their e-mail. We couldn't find one of their boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Funhog, for a neat event!  I'm glad I came out from my <br/>
anasthesia induced stupor and attempted the 90 mile drive down <br/>
there.  I apologize profusely for the gory visual my presence <br/>
brought with it (nothing like a TLC 'operation' reality show outcome <br/>
to witness in real life, is there?).  The stamps we found were <br/>
absolutely incredible and the letterboxers we met were pretty neat, <br/>
too!  What a cool venue, that aside from letterboxing, we would have <br/>
never had any earthly idea it even existed!  Since we only managed <br/>
to find 11 stamps, I think we have a whole day's worth of <br/>
letterboxing left for us to attempt there in the park.  The creek <br/>
was screaming to the kids and me to just jump in there full force <br/>
and splash around--if it weren't for the sutures, we would have <br/>
jumped right in!!!  Perhaps next visit???<br/>
<br/>
What a great way to spend a Saturday!!!  Thanks for coordinating <br/>
this event!  I apologize for not getting my letterbox planted for <br/>
the event (totally overcome by events)--I just wasn't able to really <br/>
do the clue crafting part of it justice.  I'll get it planted <br/>
sometime in the future and hopefully give folks another fun reason <br/>
to visit the area.  Looking forward to the next gathering <br/>
of 'boxers!!!<br/>
