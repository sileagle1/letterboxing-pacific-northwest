I ordered some PZ Kut but when it got here yesterday it seems to be much thinner than the speedball material I was using.  Is anyone else using it? If so are you backing it with something? <br>

I use PZKut and prefer it over most other carving materials.  It's <br>
especially good to hold fine cuts in detailed carvings, like scrolls, <br>
etc...<br>
<br>
You are right that it is pretty thin and can be hard to stamp with, <br>
so I back out stamps with wood.  Scrap wood can be found almost <br>
anywhere, and you can even use wood from throw away pallets found <br>
trashed behind many stores.<br>

I found an eraser I liked as well but it was so small that it was very limiting.  I'm planning on doing some carving with the PZ Kut tonight so we'll see how that goes.<br>
