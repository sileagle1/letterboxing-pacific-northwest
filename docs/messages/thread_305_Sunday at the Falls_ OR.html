                    <div class="plaintext-content">Everyone and their grandma decided to take a trip to Silver Falls on<br>
this perfect spring day. It was an amazingly international crowd, too.<br>
We saw Japanese camera-toting tourists, a woman hiking in a sari, a<br>
Russian gal in a dress and there were so many Hispanic folks I took to<br>
saying Hola instead of Hello! The hordes made it lousy for<br>
letterboxing but the trail was as wonderful as ever. Both my boxes<br>
there, Frenchie Falls and Buddah are just fine. <br>
<br>
I am still missing Ryan's elusive Twin Falls stamp in my book. I think<br>
I went to the correct stump this time and I am pretty sure that the<br>
box has gone missing. I didn't have the clues to the rest of his boxes<br>
with me and I didn't remember their exact hiding places. So, I am<br>
unsure about the status of his others.<br>
<br>
If you intend to letterbox, a midweek trip to this spectacular area is<br>
highly recommended. I don't know if I have ever been to this park on a<br>
sunny, warm day and I have to say that I was overwhelmed by the number<br>
of people out enjoying the falls. Au Revoir, Funhog<br>
