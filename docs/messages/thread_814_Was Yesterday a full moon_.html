Ryan, I am extreamly sorry to hear that you probably won't make Fright Fest.<br>
Please do me the favor of letting Iron`Bear and I know when you and Amanda<br>
will be in the OR or nearby WA area though and perhaps we can arrange a get<br>
together?<br>
<br>
I personally would not join an anti-Ryan club any more than I would join an<br>
anti-Rayvenhaus club...I like you both and find you both equally irritating<br>
at times <grins> -- if you never irritate anyone in life I think you are<br>
perfect and well, that is just a scary thought right?<br>
<br>
Now if anyone wants to make an anti-pandora club, I will surely join that<br>
just because I'm my own worst enemy most the time anyways.<br>
<br>
I bid you all well,<br>
