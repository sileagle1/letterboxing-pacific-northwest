feedback I've gotten on this list in the last couple of days about my<br>
stamps. Many thanks for the kudos, you guys. Before I took up this<br>
hobby/obsession I never knew I could carve a chunk of plastic into<br>
something recognizeable, much less something people would actually<br>
praise! <br>
<br>
My first (not so hot...in fact, pretty darn crappy) stamps are still<br>
out there. It's fun to see the progress. Anyone who thinks they can't<br>
carve a stamp should see those. It just shows that anyone can do it.<br>
<br>
For the benefit of any of those dreaded Least Coast spies that monitor<br>
our sacred PNW List, I want to toot our horn out here. I think we are<br>
really lucky that the originators of our local boxing scene, <br>
Tom Cheney and Mitch Klink, were especially talented carvers and<br>
clever clue writers. It raised the bar for the quality of our<br>
letterboxes here. Most contain handmade stamps and many have<br>
challenging clues. When I've gone  boxing in New England, I have found<br>
MANY store bought stamps, both as signatures and in the letterboxes.<br>
All I can say is, "there's no place like home..." Funhog<br>
