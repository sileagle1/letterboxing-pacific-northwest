                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally got a chance to check up on this box. It is not in the <br/>
original place, or anyplace easily found nearby. I looked under the <br/>
nearby logs, however I did not tear the entire area apart. There is a <br/>
lot of debris from the trail clean-up and a lot of leaves, so it could <br/>
still conceivably be around someplace.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to re-carve the stamp as best I can, if that's all right. <br/>
The clues will need to be redone as well. The trail maintainence removed <br/>
the dragon-head stump, and the two logs in the trail. They did put in a <br/>
nice bench halfway up, and a trail sign, so overall it's an improvement, <br/>
except for the missing box.<br/>
<br/>
If I replace it, I'm not sure that I want to put it back in the same <br/>
spot. It's too near the park boundary for my peace of mind - a person <br/>
finding it could easily be seen from the neighboring yards.<br/>
<br/>
Who would I ask about this? Does anyone know who the placer was, or how <br/>
to get in contact with them?<br/>
