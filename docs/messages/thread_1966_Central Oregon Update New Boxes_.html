Hi all,<br>
Just went out and placed 2 new boxes. Shevlin Park-The Resident and <br>
Tumalo 2nd edition. Also Lost Puppy is back. I also went out and found <br>
Birder's Hollinshead Park box. It's been there since November and I was first <br>
finder. Nice stamp and a great little Park. Thanks to Birder! If it wasn't for him I <br>
wouldn't have much to find!<br>
That's it for now!<br>
Later,<br>
