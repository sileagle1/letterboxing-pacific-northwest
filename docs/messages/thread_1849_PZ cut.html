Hi,<br>
Does anyone use PZ cut? how easy is it to carve compared to the <br>
staedtler mastercarve. I tried to use the staedtler vinyl eraser and <br>

Hi there! I have used both PZ Cut and Mastercarve. I find that the PZ cut holds fine <br>
detail much better but is tougher to carve. Mastercarve is softer and I find it is usually <br>
easier for beginners to work with. This material also comes in two thicknesses. I <br>
usually use the 1/2 inch variety not the 3/4 inch.<br>
<br>
In the field, I find that it is often difficult to get a good impression of a large stamp <br>
made with the thinner PZ cut or Speedy Stamp unless it has a backing. Unbacked, the <br>
thin media also I also have the added problem of my inky fingers touching the page <br>
of my logbook and leaving unwanted marks. I'm not the tidiest hog on the block. <br>
<br>
Honestly, I don't think which carving block you use. Just keep practicing. I have seen <br>
fantastic stamps carved on everything from wine corks to Pink Pearl erasers. Practice, <br>
good lighting and magnification will do wonders! Enjoy, Funhog<br>

Folks use a variety of tools including an X-acto knife and Speedball lino gouges. <br>
Several of the finest carvers I know use tools made from hypodermic needles, a sort <br>
of micro blade. When I first started making stamps, I used the gouges exclusively but <br>
over time found that I preferred an X-acto with a #11 tip. <br>
<br>
Here again, I don't think there is any one tool that's the 'right' one. Pandora's <br>
beautifully detailed stamps are made with gouges, Alafair's with needle tools and Der <br>
Mad Stamper's with X-acto blades. Experiment and you will find your favorite, too. <br>

I think Funhog as a very good point here. I am constantly tinkering with<br>
this tool or that tool - even creating my own in order to get the detail and<br>
effect that pandora and I want. I am definitely the problem solver and<br>
pandora is the carver. But the point is that we are always looking for new<br>
ways to create better stamps - so when Funhog suggests to experiment I am in<br>
total agreement. The most profound tool that pandora uses right now is a<br>
modified speedball "V" gouge that has been closed together so close that it<br>
is barely visible to the naked eye. Just keep experimenting and don't be<br>
afraid to try new things. You will find what works for you the best.<br>
<br>
I bid you all well. <br>

Hi, Kim!<br>
<br>
Welcome to the game!<br>
<br>
Strangely enough, I actually use an xacto knife because I manage to <br>
get fine details with it that I can't get with other tools!<br>
<br>
Well, I can get fine detail with one of those homemade hypodermic <br>
needle tools, but I don't have enough patience to use something that <br>
small exclusively.<br>
<br>
I like the xacto because it allows me to get into sharp corners, like <br>
when I'm carving letters, with great precision and control.  As <br>
Funhog suggests, a little bit of magnification can be a great help!  <br>
Then, without changing tools, I can remove huge chunks of rubber <br>
along the outside of the carving.<br>
<br>
But of course, I've been carving erasers with an xacto knife for 22 <br>
years now, so you might say I've kind of gotten accustomed to it by <br>
now.  That doesn't mean that it's right for everyone.<br>
<br>
I have compared techniques with several other experienced carvers, <br>
and I truly believe there is no right and wrong.  For instance, since <br>
Pandora has responded to this thread, and is a fantastic carver, I <br>
will use her as an example. I watched her recently as she tried her <br>
hand at carving with an xacto knife for the first time.  She looked <br>
as awkward as a duck in snowboots.  (Sorry, Pandy, but you know it's <br>
true.)  She managed to produce an acceptable (though simple) carving, <br>
but I could tell she felt handicapped by the unfamiliar tool.<br>
<br>
However, when Pandora puts a lino blade to the rubber, it's like <br>
watching a gold-medal figure skater on ice!  By the time she <br>
completes her carving, I feel compelled to throw roses at her feet!<br>
<br>
On the other hand, when I pick up a Speedball lino blade, I feel like <br>
I'm playing piano with mittens on.  Nothing turns out the way I want <br>
it to!<br>
<br>
So, to re-iterate what Funhog and Iron`Bear have said... experiment. <br>
Try your hand at several different tools.  Switch back and forth and <br>
find out what tool works best for you at each stage of the carving <br>
process.  Then, when you find something that feels comfortable for <br>
you, stick with it, keep practicing, and don't let anyone tell you <br>
that you're doing it wrong.<br>
<br>
If you mess up every now and then, don't sweat it!  Throw your <br>
disaster in a plastic container, hide it under a rock, and call it a <br>
letterbox!  Once in a while, you'll get everything just right and <br>
you'll love your carving so much you won't be able to part with it.  <br>
That's cool, too.  Bring it to the next gathering and show it off.<br>
<br>
The best tip I have for you is to try holding your carving tool in <br>
one place and move the rubber instead.  This technique has always <br>
worked well for me, and I've seen Pandora and many others doing the <br>
same thing.  It seems strange at first, but after a while it becomes <br>
second nature.  For the record, I tend to grip my xacto knife very <br>
close to the blade (too close, sometimes, as the tiny scars in my <br>
thumb will attest).  I think this plays a somewhat of a role in my <br>
ability to carve with precision.<br>
<br>
Through the years, I've carved in just about every material <br>
imaginable. Speedy-Cut, EZ Cut, PZ Kut, Mastercarve, plumber's <br>
gasket, cork, foam, art gum erasers, rubber pencil erasers (green and <br>
pink), ink erasers, polymer erasers, Fimo clay, potatoes... you name <br>
it.<br>
<br>
For years, my favorite material has been Pink Pearl pencil erasers. I <br>
like them because I tend to carve small, detailed stamps, and the <br>
Pink Pearls are firm and durable.  However, they are somewhat porous, <br>
requiring a heavy coating of ink to produce a good imprint, and they <br>
only come in one size: small.<br>
<br>
As a result, I am one of the many carvers who has gravitated towards <br>
PZ Kut.  It comes in large sheets, it is firm and durable like a Pink <br>
Pearl, and it is smooth enough to produce a good print with a <br>
moderate coating of ink.  Mastercarve is easier to carve, but <br>
detailed carvings tend to be very fragile, and if you press too hard <br>
when you print with them, they will smoosh and smear.<br>
<br>
But I think it's fun to switch things up a little every now and then. <br>

Hey! I resemble that remark! I tried so hard too! And I even gifted DMS with<br>
the result. (Partly because I didn't want to look at it anymore) I have<br>
tried and tried to learn to carve with an xacto knife, I've had Funhog and<br>
DMS both try to teach me, for the life of me I cannot do it and produce<br>
anything of quality.<br>

Awwe that is so sweet! Really though, you all give me way too much credit,<br>
there are much better carvers out there than me. And I still insist that the<br>
only reason I can carve the way I carve is because I am lucky enough to have<br>
an artist in the house that can draw the image in a way that I can see<br>
clearly how to carve it. Iron`Bear is the artist, I'm just the girl with the<br>
shovel :)<br>

I could not agree more. As a matter of fact, often times I even put<br>
something underneath the material to help it move easier. At home I tend to<br>
use a little cutting mat, you can pick them up at the craft store for a<br>
couple of dollars, however the ever ingenious Funhog showed a group once<br>
that you could use the wrapper on a piece of Steadler Mastercarve in the<br>
exact same fashion and it comes free with the material.<br>
<br>
In all honesty I have learned almost every technique I use from watching<br>
other people. I took a class Funhog taught and when she taught shading I<br>
thought to myself, Oh Oh Oh I need to play with this... and know I am a<br>
little shading fool! I think if any Letterboxer gets the opportunity they<br>
should watch several of their favorite artists set tool to rubber... you<br>
will be amazed the little tricks you might pick up and decide to make your<br>
own.<br>
