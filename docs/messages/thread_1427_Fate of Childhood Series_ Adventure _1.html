I am so glad that you and your husband enjoyed yourself, I know that is what<br>
it is all about for me, letterboxing is very special to me because it gives<br>
Iron`Bear and I something special to do together that we both enjoy and it's<br>
quality time together.  I'm just tickled to know that another couple enjoyed<br>
getting that Fate of the Childhood as much as we enjoyed planting it.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Have you and your husband considered coming to the Passport to Letterboxing<br>
Stamp Camp in August or to Funhog's Event out in Longview this Saturday? I<br>
would love to meet you.  <br>
