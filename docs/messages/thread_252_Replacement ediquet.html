                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey I was just wondering.  I seem to be coming across quite a few <br>
boxes that appear to be missing and I think, hmmm, could I carve and <br>
replace a nerw one here since the owner of the box isn't responding?  <br>
These boxes are in Beaverton and were placed by Der Mad Stamper.  I <br>
have found wonderful locations along the way also while looking.  So <br>
I am curious about ediquet on this subject.  Don't wanna step on <br>
anyone's toes, lol.  Just thinking it might be nice for someone <br>
looking to actually find something. And I live in the area, I could <br>
keep tabs ons on it...  The specific box I am talking about right now <br>
is the Bronsons Creek one.  I am sure I found the proper <br>
location.....  Does anyone have any knowledge of this box.  The <br>
planted date is from 2001, most of the older ones seem to be gone.  <br>
<br>
Any comments either way anyone?   Wingnut<br>

Der Mad Stamper gave Ryan C. permission to replace his Ponytail falls <br>
and PCC etc. boxes. He probably wouldn't mind if you replaced others <br>
that went missing. <br>
See if you can get a copy of the stamp from someone who found it <br>
before it went missing. (or as i remember Bronson Creek wasn't that <br>
spectacular! --one of those foam jobs with the letters BC and a sort <br>
of fish? Maybe you could just do an all new stamp!!) <br>

<br>
In any case, before replacing someone else's box, I'd definitely try to get ahold of the owner first.  Particularly if they aren't locals, they may greatly appreciate help in maintaining orphaned boxes!<br>
<br>
If that fails--which it did in the case of MIA D.M. Stamper--I found copies of the original images and recarved them.  I tried to replace them as close to their original locations as possible, although his Gorge boxes couldn't be rehid in their original locations.<br>
<br>
The Bronson Creek box--if it is missing--I wouldn't have any qualms about replacing.  It's a wonderful clue, and anyone that follows it to the end deserves the treat!  I do have a copy of the original stamp back in California, although as Amanda said it wasn't especially impressive.  Not only was it those lame foam stamps, but he glued them to the top of a peanut butter jar's lid for the backing--an awkward and clumsy stamp.  I wouldn't mind seeing a new and improved stamp myself, but if you want to keep the original spirit of it, I can send a copy once I return to California.  (It might be awhile.)  There might be someone closer that can get a copy of the stamp quicker than myself, though.<br>
