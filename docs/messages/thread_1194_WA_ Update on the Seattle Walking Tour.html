out and checked it this afternoon.  Reports on its death have been <br/>
greatly exaggerated.  It's ALIVE AND WELL, I'm happy to report and <br/>
still waiting for lots of visitors!  =)  <br/>
<br/>
Since Amanda and I were in the area, we also headed out to find the <br/>
Klondike Gold Rush letterbox.  The stamp is starting to crumble <br/>
pretty badly, unfortunately, so the box is alive, though not as well <br/>
as it could be.  Anyone that wants this box might want to nab it <br/>
while there's still a stamp left to stamp with!<br/>
