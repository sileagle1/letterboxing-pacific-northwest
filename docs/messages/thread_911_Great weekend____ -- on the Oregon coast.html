                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also too headed to the Oregon coast later<br>
in the day on Saturday.  Woke up this morning<br>
to bright sunny skies and a warm day for early<br>
November.  Letterboxing we found Picea Sitchensis<br>
and were the 1st to find the replaced Ecola Letterbox, <br>
but didn't have enough time to get the other nearby boxes.  <br>
<br>
We saw where the Lennen's 3 had found Picea Sitchensis<br>
just the day before, which we found after the sun had<br>
already set.  Gosh, it sure is DARK in that forest after<br>
sundown, and for some strange reason after finding <br>
that box we had a sudden urge to rush home and drink<br>
hot chocolate.  ;o)  (you'll have to find the box<br>
to understand what I mean.)<br>
<br>
All in all a nice day boxing,<br>

box together soon. We ran out of time to do the newly placed Ecola <br>
Letterbox!!!   <br>
We had a great time, Wow what a gigantic tree.  SInce the last time <br>
I had been there, they have build the deck around the tree.  I <br>
remember walking up on the base of it for a picture. I can imagine <br>
that forest would get pretty dark!!!!!Yes, hot chocolate did sound <br>
very good on the way home!!!!!!<br>
HOpe to talk to you soon<br>
