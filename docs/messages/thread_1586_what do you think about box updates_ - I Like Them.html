one trip, I realize it is easier to post a general note<br>
to a Talklist.  Either way, I like to hear the status of<br>
my boxes, even if it is bad news, so I can keep them updated.<br>
In fact, if I had not seen Funhog's post of AZ Roadie's web<br>
page of recent finds, I would not have known that my Navajo<br>
Bridge Microbox was still alive, after a couple of people <br>
had reported it missing.  Thanks to all that take the time<br>
to share their experiences.<br>
