<br/>
I am trying to visit all of my boxes and check them before winter sets in. While I was out <br/>
this weekend I checked Lower Bridge-The Fisherman, The Catch and The <br/>
Crawfish,Tetherow Crossing, Funhog's Tetherow House and finally picked up Birder's Blue <br/>
Fisherman. These were some of my first boxes and all are doing great. I gave the Blue <br/>
Fisherman box  a new box as it was cracked and full of bugs but all the others were in <br/>
good shape!, and while checking my Lower Bridge Series I saw an actual Blue Fisherman! It <br/>
was huge!<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>

Don't you just love the tropical heat wave we're having in Central OR?<br/>
It's 70 degrees here at the moment! Funhog<br/>
