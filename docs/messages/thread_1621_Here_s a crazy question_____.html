                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were blessed to have been the first at a recent<br/>
letterbox which surprised us with a stamp that was<br/>
quite opposite of what we expected.  My transfer<br/>
wasn't what I had hoped...bummer...but the stamp<br/>
itself was fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Here's the crazy question...<br/>
<br/>
That particular stamp will envoke more "memorable<br/>
moments" for some - not all - if stamped in the colors<br/>
the carver and placer intended it to be stamped in -<br/>
or at least by the stamp the placer put into the log<br/>
as a guide.  <br/>
<br/>
What happens when the boxer comes across a box where<br/>
that stamp has been hit with one of those intense<br/>
black stamp pads and the ink embeds itself into the<br/>
stamp?  We came across an entire series where we<br/>
fought with cleaning each and every stamp only to have<br/>
the black filter through every color ink we used.  It<br/>
was moderately frustrating but part of the hobby I<br/>
presume.<br/>
<br/>
Charlie TrailDuster shared on the trails with us that<br/>
he takes the time to clean off the stamp and use<br/>
different colors to really enhance what is often an<br/>
already remarkable carving.  This is a suggestion<br/>
we've taken to heart....but it wasn't possible on this<br/>
one particular series.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you do when this happens?  What is being used<br/>
to clean the stamps while on the trail? and do you<br/>
test stamp on scrap before stamping in your permanent<br/>
log book?  <br/>
<br/>
THanks in advance for the answers.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We tried the blotting...we tend to do that anyway as<br/>
we've found numerous boxes where the stamp appears<br/>
it's just been inked (like we are on the tail of<br/>
another boxer) when in fact it's been a week.  Not<br/>
sure what to attribute that to other than the stamp<br/>
has signficant ink left on it after the stamp in takes<br/>
place OR there is condensation getting into the bag<br/>
and holding the color onto it.<br/>
<br/>
We tried the baby wipes deal (as devonpeter) suggested<br/>
and that just wasn't working - and prompted this<br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to find a chemical or solvent that would<br/>
cure the inking issue but ensure the integrity of the<br/>
stamp remains.  Like Q-tips soaked in alcohol or<br/>
something.  I don't have one of the treacherous blank<br/>
ink pads here....everything I've got wipes off like a<br/>
dream....so I'm hoping to pull from the expertise of<br/>
fellow boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice....keep it coming.<br/>
<br/>
(p.s. Maiden - I got bummed with my attempt at using<br/>
yellow...per the orignal stamp's picture....YIKES!)<br/>
