                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were blessed to have been the first at a recent<br>
letterbox which surprised us with a stamp that was<br>
quite opposite of what we expected.  My transfer<br>
wasn't what I had hoped...bummer...but the stamp<br>
itself was fun.  <br>
<br>
Here's the crazy question...<br>
<br>
That particular stamp will envoke more "memorable<br>
moments" for some - not all - if stamped in the colors<br>
the carver and placer intended it to be stamped in -<br>
or at least by the stamp the placer put into the log<br>
as a guide.  <br>
<br>
What happens when the boxer comes across a box where<br>
that stamp has been hit with one of those intense<br>
black stamp pads and the ink embeds itself into the<br>
stamp?  We came across an entire series where we<br>
fought with cleaning each and every stamp only to have<br>
the black filter through every color ink we used.  It<br>
was moderately frustrating but part of the hobby I<br>
presume.<br>
<br>
Charlie TrailDuster shared on the trails with us that<br>
he takes the time to clean off the stamp and use<br>
different colors to really enhance what is often an<br>
already remarkable carving.  This is a suggestion<br>
we've taken to heart....but it wasn't possible on this<br>
one particular series.  <br>
<br>
What do you do when this happens?  What is being used<br>
to clean the stamps while on the trail? and do you<br>
test stamp on scrap before stamping in your permanent<br>
log book?  <br>
<br>
THanks in advance for the answers.<br>

  I have come across this.  I pour water over the stamp (from my water<br>
  bottle I carry) & clean it with a dry paper towel.  Then I use the<br>
  back of the clue sheet to try it.  If still not good, I wash again.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We tried the blotting...we tend to do that anyway as<br>
we've found numerous boxes where the stamp appears<br>
it's just been inked (like we are on the tail of<br>
another boxer) when in fact it's been a week.  Not<br>
sure what to attribute that to other than the stamp<br>
has signficant ink left on it after the stamp in takes<br>
place OR there is condensation getting into the bag<br>
and holding the color onto it.<br>
<br>
We tried the baby wipes deal (as devonpeter) suggested<br>
and that just wasn't working - and prompted this<br>
question.<br>
<br>
I was hoping to find a chemical or solvent that would<br>
cure the inking issue but ensure the integrity of the<br>
stamp remains.  Like Q-tips soaked in alcohol or<br>
something.  I don't have one of the treacherous blank<br>
ink pads here....everything I've got wipes off like a<br>
dream....so I'm hoping to pull from the expertise of<br>
fellow boxers.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the advice....keep it coming.<br>
<br>
(p.s. Maiden - I got bummed with my attempt at using<br>
yellow...per the orignal stamp's picture....YIKES!)<br>
