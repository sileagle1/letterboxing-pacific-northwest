You mentioned you letterbox with your children.  There is a group for<br/>
families who letterbox together.  The link to the homepage is:  <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lb-jr/<br/>
<br/>
There is usually a Topic of the Week and those are a lot of fun.  It is a<br/>
national group, but there are plenty of us from the PNW on it, too.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet you - KeliKana<br/>

CherokeeNewman - good evening. <br/>
<br/>
Great to have you aboard - and welcome to the LbPNW list; I am sorry to hear<br/>
that you heard about the event to late - I assure you there will be others<br/>
come along. Hopefully one of our fellow boxers will give some mercy to<br/>
Charlie over there and have one here in Oregon. -chuckles- <br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to make a comment or two -ok probably more than that I can<br/>
tend to ramble- about your wife not getting into letterboxing just yet. I<br/>
will be honest with you at the start I was not into Letterboxing as much as<br/>
pandora was. I have hiked all of my life - even walking to the school bus as<br/>
a kid was a 2 mile hike -in the snow both ways- [had to put that in there<br/>
you know] and had been to some amazing places during my hikes so I didn't<br/>
see the big deal of going out and finding some stamp out in the north 40<br/>
some where.  However the more that we did it the more I was proven wrong -<br/>
and that was driven home to me when pandora my wife - sim`kitty my daughter<br/>
and I went on a six plus mile hike to the horsetail falls area in the Gorge<br/>
and we went for three boxes. I was so proud of my daughter for being able to<br/>
take every step right along with me even up through such a high elevation<br/>
gain - and equally happy and proud of being able to share the experience<br/>
with my family of visiting three amazing water falls. Then after reading<br/>
something that pandora had wrote in her logbook about her experiences with<br/>
letterboxing I was reminded yet again of just the sort of wonderful gifts<br/>
that this hobby can bring. She went on to write that this hobby had given<br/>
our family something to do together as just that - a family. That it was<br/>
something that we would always remember - and something that we would be<br/>
able to do for a very long time no matter what our age was. It was special<br/>
to her for being able to share something so simple with me. <br/>
<br/>
That is when the preverbal brick fell from the sky and I began to seek out<br/>
things that I could enjoy within this hobby known as letterboxing on top of<br/>
hiking to find the box. I enjoy drawing - and at times I can draw more than<br/>
just a stick figure. So I began to figure out how to draw images that you<br/>
could carve onto a stamp. I also am not to bad at coming up with different<br/>
ways to make things work or to improve them - whether that is figuring out<br/>
how to get all of those different colored ink pads into one container so<br/>
that they do not bounce around in your bag all over - or have the caps come<br/>
off - to modifying speedball nibs so that they are smaller than store bought<br/>
ones therefore give the carver a better tool to create detailed stamps. And<br/>
I must say I really love it and now I wouldn't give up letterboxing for<br/>
anything in the world. <br/>
<br/>
My point in rambling on like this - which I apologize for - is this. Keep<br/>
Letterboxing - and keep encouraging your wife to go with you. I have no<br/>
doubts that she will find her specialty in this hobby - perhaps she can<br/>
create a special family Letterboxing scrapbook in conjunction with her<br/>
pictures and your stamp images - or perhaps she would enjoy making some hand<br/>
made logbooks for the letterboxes - that I am hoping you will plant.  But I<br/>
know that if you stick with this hobby long enough you are going to find<br/>
something that each one of you are really going to enjoy doing. It's a great<br/>
sport - game - hobby whatever you want to call it because it takes into<br/>
consideration so many other things - skills and other past times. <br/>
<br/>
Once again welcome to the list - and I look forward to being able to meet<br/>
you someday. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you well. <br/>

a hike this next Saturday.  She didn't mention Letterboxing but <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Iron Bear was able to convey quite well what I think and feel about letterboxing. I enjoy carving the most. My spouse loves to sit and chat and exchange personal stamps. My dogs love the walk outdoors. <br/>
I have two labradors. One is a therapy dog and one is in training. They need to be around people. I taught them to be that way and it's my responsibility to make sure they don't spend too much time alone. When planning activities, I often think about whether or not the dogs can come. For example, I considered getting a zoo membership but the dogs can't go. Rather than do something that takes a lot of time without the dogs, I decided to go only a few times rather than get a membership that would make me wanna go all the time. Not really a sacrifice, just a choice. <br/>
Letterboxing is something that the entire family can enjoy. If someone likes to hike, then the letterboxer can box at the same time. A bird watcher can go along with a letterboxer and both can be happy. <br/>
I love the dog park boxes cuz the girls can run their little lab hearts out and I can box. Of course, one of my boxes at a dog park in Vancouver has been vandalized TWICE. After the first time, I replaced the stamp with a similar one with the same theme. Less than a week later, the stamp was missing again. I had a hard time believing it. <br/>
Wow, why am I talking so much today? LOL<br/>
Happy boxing, Pupp (Team Nashoba)<br/>

that they do not bounce around in your bag all over - or have the caps come<br/>
off - to modifying speedball nibs so that they are smaller than store bought<br/>
ones therefore give the carver a better tool to create detailed stamps. And<br/>
I must say I really love it and now I wouldn't give up letterboxing for<br/>
anything in the world. <br/>
<br/>
My point in rambling on like this - which I apologize for - is this. Keep<br/>
Letterboxing - and keep encouraging your wife to go with you. I have no<br/>
doubts that she will find her specialty in this hobby - perhaps she can<br/>
create a special family Letterboxing scrapbook in conjunction with her<br/>
pictures and your stamp images - or perhaps she would enjoy making some hand<br/>
made logbooks for the letterboxes - that I am hoping you will plant. But I<br/>
know that if you stick with this hobby long enough you are going to find<br/>
something that each one of you are really going to enjoy doing. It's a great<br/>
sport - game - hobby whatever you want to call it because it takes into<br/>
consideration so many other things - skills and other past times. <br/>
<br/>
Once again welcome to the list - and I look forward to being able to meet<br/>
you someday. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you well. <br/>

week and my other post did go through. So I better write it again.<br/>

We have been letterboxing for just over a year, but have taken a <br/>
rather leisurely pace compared to what I see on this list. I love to <br/>
letterbox, my two boys, 5 and 8 enjoy it and my husband comes along. <br/>
All along he has said that he would rather Geocache, he doesn't like <br/>
the clues.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago he picked up a Garmin GPS for a steal at a <br/>
garage sale and so this weekend instead of going Letterboxing we went <br/>
Geocaching. Let me tell you I would much rather go Letterboxing any <br/>
day. I was getting carsick trying to watch the GPS and check the <br/>
coordinates and you do a lot of driving around, sometimes in circles <br/>
trying to find your location or road (depending on the box). I <br/>
finally ended up doing the driving and let my husband do the <br/>
navigating. Hummmm.... The ones where you get out on a trail and <br/>
walked were better.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, he conceded that letterboxing is fun and we could keep <br/>
doing it. Like he had any say in the matter! So now we are a <br/>
crossover family. I saw CharlieTrailDusters name in one of the Geo <br/>
logs so I know he's a crossover. I just feel empty leaving a Geocache <br/>
box because I don't get a stamp in my log. I love the stamps! Of <br/>
course my kids love the toys!<br/>
<br/>
I love all the new letterboxes that are popping up all over in SW <br/>
Washington. At our pace it will keep us busy for months.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have enjoyed the group so far and look forward to trying to <br/>
make it to a future gathering. I didn't find out about this group <br/>
until someone posted about how fun the Battleground gathering was in <br/>
lb-jr and when I asked how you find out about these events I was <br/>
referred to this group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being a great group of letterboxers,<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to this list, I have seen your stamp here and there the last several<br/>
months, which is great. Even more so now that you were able to introduce<br/>
yourself - sorry to hear that your first e-mail was swallowed by the<br/>
internet troll. -smiles- With that said welcome again to the list - and glad<br/>
to hear you are enjoying this wonderful hobby just like the rest of us. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you well. <br/>
