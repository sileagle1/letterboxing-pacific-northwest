                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last week I received an email from Jim Bader, Park Manager at Silver Falls State Park <br>
telling me he had my letterbox from Frenchie Falls sitting on his desk. He told me I <br>
could pick it up any weekday and gave me a phone number at which to contact him. I <br>
had no idea what to expect.<br>
<br>
Today, figuring it would be much better for me to visit him in person, I headed out <br>
there to act as letterboxing diplomat extraordinaire. I took my logbook, my sig <br>
stamp, a printed copy of a web page from the Connecticut State Forest Department <br>
about their letterboxing program (They even give patches to you after you've found <br>
five of them and a trekking pole if you get all thirty!) and a copy of my Frenchie Falls <br>
clue. I was armed!<br>
<br>
It turned out that he was TOTALLY receptive to having boxes in his park. He only <br>
requested that he be notified about their existence and location. He suggested we <br>
have Stamp Camp in the park next summer because they have miles and miles of <br>
trails at Silver Falls that are rarely used. He figured we could seed some of those trails <br>
with Letterboxing bait. I met Ranger Sarah, the education person at they park, who <br>
now wants to incorporate letterboxing into the Junior Ranger program. She was so <br>
excited that she exclaimed,"I think I've found a new hobby!"<br>
<br>
Having spent an hour together, Jim returned my box to me and suggested I head out <br>
and rehide it and was invited to participate in the camp program next summer. It was <br>
a real thumbs up day for me and my Lb obsession. <br>
<br>
That said, I checked on my Buddah box, Ryan's North Falls box and rehid my Frenchie <br>
Falls box. The clue to the last needs a bit of revision since its old hiding place is now <br>
exposed but the other two are just fine.  I'm pretty sure that Ryan's Winter Falls box <br>
is missing and I didn't have the time to check on his other plants. Amazingly enough, <br>
almost all the visitors to these boxes were from out of the area. Here we have this <br>
terrific park so close to Portland and the local boxers have pretty much ignored it. <br>
The maples are beginning to change and the weather is still warm. It's the perfect <br>
time to get on out there. <br>
