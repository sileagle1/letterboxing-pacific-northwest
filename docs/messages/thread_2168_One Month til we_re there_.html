I can't wait either! We are having a gathering to meet them aren't we?<br>

============<br>
<br>
It  would be great to get together for some boxing and/or a meal while we're<br>
out your way. We tend to hike the whole day, as long as there is light (but<br>
we have had to break out the flashlights on more than one occasion...). When<br>
we were in Pennsylvania in May we hiked w/4 different local boxers on 3<br>
days. We also met some others for dinner one night. Always fun to meet more<br>
addicts!<br>
We don't have a fixed schedule yet, so if a certain day is better for  any<br>
of  you, just let us know. We'll arrive late on Friday AUG 26 and then have<br>
AUG 27-SEP 4 available for hiking/boxing. We fly home on SEP 5  (Labor Day)<br>

I've read about you being consumed by your project this summer, <br>
hopefully all is going well.  There's a good chance we will be in the <br>
Seattle area since we have some friends that live there.  We'll <br>
probably head up to visit them one of the days.<br>
<br>
It would be great to meet more local boxers, so I'll keep you posted on <br>
our plans.  We're hoping to work on our trip details this weekend.<br>
