                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, so after I went up there (and ran into a really cool couple <br>
looking up letterboxes in the area, and heading to mine next,) I went <br>
around tucked them in tight and cross my fingers they will make it <br>
thru the snow. I was suprized to see how busy it was up there still! <br>
They were better hidden than I had thought, and in really good <br>
shape!  I was excited to see everyone stamped in, and will have to <br>
make it up next Spring early to replace the log books....<br>
<br>
ALSO, revised clues for the first box will be posted soon, they took <br>
the entire structure down that had the "21" on it.  My applogies to <br>
those who have missed this one.  So, you still have time to go get <br>
these before the snow starts!  Wingnut<br>
