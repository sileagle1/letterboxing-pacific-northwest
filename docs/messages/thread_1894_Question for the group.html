I usually keep my opinions to myself, but could not pass this one <br>
up. Lets just say I think becoming experienced is more a "mind set" <br>
than an actual "time frame". I have only been boxing for two years, <br>
but compared to alot of other people in this area, that might be a <br>
long time. There are several people in this area that have not been <br>
boxing as long as I have, but I would consider them much more <br>
experienced than myself. If you catch letterboxing fever (you go <br>
letterboxing at least once a week, or maybe more) you will be <br>
experienced very quickly.<br>
