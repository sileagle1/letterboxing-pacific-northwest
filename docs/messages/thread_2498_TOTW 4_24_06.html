extremely bad weather  How about an ice storm that closed down the Zoo, I<br/>
found the box but had to chip the block of ice that was encompassing the box<br/>
to get to it. By the time I got to the box, my hands were to numb to log in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
, at night, - Dang werewolves, grumble grumble grumble. AND the ranger had<br/>
closed the gate, thank goodness he hadnt locked it <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
swam a creek  See story below<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the greatest lengths Ive gone to for a box was to trudge through<br/>
the thigh deep flood waters in January, not once, but on two different<br/>
sections of the trail. I remember praying that there was nothing in there<br/>
that would bite :-) But hey, I got the box!<br/>

To what lengths have you gone to get a letterbox?  Have you boxed in <br/>
extremely bad weather, at night, on a super long hike, slogged through <br/>
mud, swam a creek or larger body of water?<br/>
