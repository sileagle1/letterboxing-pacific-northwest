I spent the day yesterday collecting Candlelight's St. Edwards Park <br>
trio.  I've been to that park several times before, but yesterday it <br>
became one of my all-time favorites.  Lots of other folks had the <br>
same idea too!  Box #2 in particular was tricky to get and replace <br>
without folks catching on, but I'm pretty sure I managed it.  Great <br>
stamps and super great hiding places all!  <br>
<br>
Oh, and be sure to check out the brand new children's play area <br>
adjacent to the orchard.  Volunteers were out in droves yesterday to <br>
finish up this stunning castle for the kiddies.  It'll make a nice <br>
resting place for adults who just finished that Grotto Trail climb <br>
too! Whew!<br>

Now the proud owner of *10* stamps!<br>
