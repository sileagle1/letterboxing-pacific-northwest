I have recently lost my compass (might be somewhere up on Mount Tabor<br/>
after late night letterboxing...). I borrowed one from a friend and it<br/>
made me realize how awful mine was! This one was much easier to<br/>
center, and 'settled' quicker. It just happened to be the one from the<br/>
geocaching website.<br/>
<br/>
So, instead of ordering it through them and paying for shipping, where<br/>
can I get a compass in or around Portland, OR? <br/>
<br/>
I would like it to be under $20 and simple. <br/>
<br/>
What kind of compass do you have? I have been made aware that I should<br/>
not buy a compass that was made in the southern hemmisphere..? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Silva Forecaster Compass<br/>
$9.00  Item 408128 at REI<br/>
<br/>
It's small, accurate, stable, can serve as a key-ring and even <br/>
includes a thermometer.  <br/>
<br/>
I owned a GPS (til it was stolen in a car break-in) and also have a <br/>
military lensatic compass (which is extremely accurate, great for <br/>
work but too cumbersome for letterboxing)--so I always fall back on <br/>
this little Silva Forecaster.<br/>
<br/>
You can't beat it for $9!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

You can see the compass I use in my compass tutorial. So long as AQ<br/>
keeps working, at least, you can find it at<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/compass/terms.html which has lots<br/>
of pretty pictures of stuff. =) My mom actually uses the colored<br/>
version I have listed while I prefer the clear one myself.<br/>
<br/>
As for where to purchase a compass--if the Amazon.com link isn't<br/>
enticing enough *innocent smile*--you can probably find a decent<br/>
compass at a local outfitters such as REI or G.I. Joes<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

Yeah, OK, so I work for REI.  I may be slightly biased, but what the  <br/>
hay!<br/>
<br/>
I just bought the Silva Polaris 177 Compass ($10.00) for  <br/>
letterboxing. It's small, lightweight, easy to use and well made.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a link to more stuff on how to choose a compass, courtesy of  <br/>

And did I say, "Compasses are cool!"? Well, they are.<br/>

I have never heard about southern hemisphere compasses. Sounds like  <br/>
an urban legend, but a cool one none the less!<br/>

<br/>
Actually, there is, alledgedly, a certain degree of truth to this. The<br/>
magnetic flux lines around the earth aren't parallel to the ground<br/>
anywhere except the equator. Around the rest of the world, they're<br/>
angled to the ground and therefore it pulls the needle point into the<br/>
ground.<br/>
<br/>
In the northern hemisphere, the lines of flux pull the north needle<br/>
downward while in the southern hemisphere, the lines of flux pull the<br/>
south needle downward. So compasses in the northern hemishere have a<br/>
counterweight on the south needle to keep the needle level and vice<br/>
versa for the southern hemisphere.<br/>
<br/>
It's not really the location of where the compass was made that<br/>
matters, but what side of the compass the counterweight is on. You'd<br/>
be hard-pressed to find a southern-hemisphere compass in the northern<br/>
hemisphere and vice-versa but, allegedly, they really do exist!<br/>
<br/>
I've never taken my compass to the southern hemisphere to see what<br/>
happens, but perhaps the next time I visit, I will....<br/>
