I received a recent report of Missing for my Letterboox box.  I'm happy <br>

not truly missing.  Whew!<br>

Everybody knows I'm prejudiced from our friendship, but truly that box<br>
is one of the most gorgeous carvings around.  Glad is is not missing.<br>
 And, ahem, I must say I was the first to get it!  <br>
