Hi there--I think I 'hyperlinked' the campsite info website to the <br/>
blog.  If the link isn't working, it was the Valley of the Rogue State <br/>
Park campsite--just off I-5.  The reason I liked the site was because <br/>
it was quick on/off access from the interstate, inexpensive &amp; had FREE <br/>
hot showers!!! Another nice thing is that, lately, I've been camping <br/>
alone with my kids--I try to find campsites with LOTS of other people <br/>
for security/safety reasons--the RVers seem to be nice, normal folks in <br/>
most cases. <br/>
<br/>
Most other campgrounds we find (esp WA state) you must pay for <br/>
showers.  If you're lucky at this particular campsite, they may even <br/>
have one of their 2 yurts available--so you can 'camp' indoors for <br/>
about $27/night.  One drawback is that the interstate noise is not too <br/>
far off--but that seems to be a problem with many 'state park' <br/>
campsites we find (even ones relatively off the beaten path like <br/>
Larrabee SP up near Bellingham, WA)--if you're tent camping it's a <br/>
problem but in the winter we 'car' camp so it muffled the sound a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Camping with kids can be a lot of fun but it can also be rather <br/>
chaotic!  The trick is packing 'exactly' what you need and nothing <br/>
else.  We've streamlined our packing list quite a bit--mostly down to <br/>
bare essentials and many items have multiple purposes--ie plates can be <br/>
used as bowls, lantern converts to a flashlight/British torch. My kids <br/>
have some rules for camping, too--like limited toys, we continue with <br/>
school and our typical 'bedtime' routine--reading, studying and such. <br/>
As we're homeschooling, I must bring along our 'school books', too--so <br/>
they add some bulk to our cargo a bit but I whittle those down to the <br/>
bare essentials we'll need for the trip. I also carry a water filter <br/>
pitcher--so lugging liters upon liters of water isn't always necessary--<br/>
if I have access to a spigot then I can fill up for the day whereever.  <br/>
Hope this helps a bit.  I suggest a couple of 'local' camping outings <br/>
to work through the 'glitches' that will always come up before you <br/>
venture out on some long distance trips.  We still always manage to <br/>
forget one or two of those 'essential' items but after awhile--you <br/>
learn how to adapt and improvise i.e. 'MacGyver-ise' your way through <br/>
the trip.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!  When we return back home from this trip, we plan to venture up <br/>
your way and explore quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS The snake standoff in the Louisiana bayou was pretty interesting!  <br/>
We'd seen lots of snakes on the trails before but we had never had <br/>
to 'fight' a snake(s) for a letterbox!  ;)  {{disclaimer--no snakes <br/>
were harmed in the hunting of this particular letterbox...}}<br/>

So are geocaches more common overseas and in the US?  Seems like<br/>
letterboxing is popular in pockets of the US and scarce elsewhere.  I thank<br/>
my lucky stars for all you folks that went before us and planted letter<br/>
boxes that spur our interest to continue the hobby . . . . guess that'd be<br/>
