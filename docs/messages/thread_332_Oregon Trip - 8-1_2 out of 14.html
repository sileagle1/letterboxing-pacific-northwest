                    <div class="plaintext-content">Had the pleasure of speaking at a conference in North Bend, OR, last week.  Took advantage of the opportunity and did some boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Late Sunday night logged on and found the new clues to Alton Baker Park in Eugene.  Got there late Monday afternoon, finally found the park, and started out.  The park is great, the boxes in great locations, and had firsties on all four!  Be sure to get them soon.  At Rose Of Aberlone, a gal was on top of the bank by the box, threw a tennis ball into the mini-river, her happy dog bounded down the bank into the river to fetch the ball.  As I approached Swinton there was a long necked bird stretched as high as can be, checking out the countryside.  Should have invited Hoopoe, she would know what it was.<br/>
<br/>
Went out to Shore Acres during a dull part of the conference.  Ryan's box is there and in good shape.  He didn't mention the parking fee and the formal gardens there, the roses and rhodies (and others) were not done blooming, a beautiful garden well worth the trip by itself.<br/>
<br/>
Strawberry by the Sea is in great shape.  Beautiful wayside, great rock hiding it.<br/>
<br/>
Stopped by Cape Perpetual Interpretive Center just as it closed.  Looked for jeepjeep's new box, no idea where the WWII Observation Tower was, didn't show on the few maps I found, not at the observation point way up the hill.  Next time...<br/>
<br/>
The 804 Trail in Yachats was interesting.  Got to the spot two armlengths away, was staring at the exposed box.  When I picked it up, it seemed light.  Because it was an empty box!  Knew it was the box because of the two labels taped on it.  Hid the box, looked around the area, no sign of any of the contents.  emailed EarthWords, they have a perpetual error in their email address.<br/>
<br/>
Stopped at the Mike Miller State Park, went to the viewing platform, must not have known what the "Troll Bridge" was.  Poked and prodded to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
Went to the Salem Riverfront Park, found the likely location, but city parks crews were out and about, so didn't give it away by looking too diligently :-(<br/>
<br/>
Stopped at Bush's Pasture.  Found the map, all became obvious.  Again, found the spot but did not go for it; not only city parks crews, but several neighbors in the street and yard doing work.  Best to go back later rather than give it away.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least was Woodmansee Park.  Found Park and George (but not the geocache, although a geocacher had left a spider in the letterbox when they could not find the cache).  Both in good shape.  Didn't find Sunday; got ont he right trail, but the appropriate trees were not on the pavement, and the 'above knee high' grass was VERY wet thanks to the light rain showers of the morning.  Having a long trip home, decided wet pants were not an option.<br/>
<br/>
Great week, great boxes, beautiful ocean, have to go back to get the missed and the rest<br/>

<br/>
Are you sure my clue doesn't mention where you can park for free?  I could have sworn I included that, although it does require a hike which if you pay the entrance fee you can skip.<br/>
