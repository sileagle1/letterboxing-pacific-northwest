                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, hubby and I thought we'd hit Funhog's Discovery Trail and <br/>
Rookery boxes. <br/>
<br/>
We found the Discovery Trail box easily (inside of box and plastic <br/>
bags were wet, but no real damage). We laid everything out in the <br/>
beautiful sunshine for a few minutes to try to dry it out. The walk <br/>
was beautiful, even with all the mosquitoes!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we had no luck with the Rookery box. I know at one <br/>
time it had been missing, but I thought I saw on the main list that <br/>
it had been replaced. Were the clues changed? I'm sure we'll get out <br/>
there again once we know for sure we were looking at the right clues!<br/>
<br/>
And just a side note: as we were driving to the boxes, we saw a <br/>
rubber stamp store on the side of the road and decided to hit it on <br/>
our way back out. We were so excited, just imaging all the great <br/>
stuff they'd have in there for us! We were very disappointed to see <br/>
it is, in fact, a rubber stamp store. They only sell pre-made rubber <br/>
stamp (what's the point?!). Oh well.<br/>

LOL!!!!!  Well, you can't really accuse them of false advertising, I <br/>
suppose....  =)  <br/>
<br/>
Few rubber stamps stores I've come across seem to have really joined <br/>
the letterboxing bandwagon--which is kind of surprising since it <br/>
couldn't possibily do anything but help their buisiness.  Even so, <br/>
most of them I've seen usually have a tiny (VERY tiny) area with <br/>
carving blocks and the Speedball carving tools.  Hand-carved stamps <br/>
definitely aren't their specialty, though.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, if you're ever looking for the Mastercarve stuff (the <br/>
stuff that "cuts like butter"), most stamp stores I've been to <br/>
usually carry that instead of the pink stuff.  If you don't know what <br/>
I'm talking about, for those that went to the South Sound <br/>
Letterboxing Quest Fest--the event stamp was made from the stuff.  <br/>
The stamp in the Crappy Stamp Letterbox also uses the 'butter'.<br/>
<br/>
And even if they don't have carving blocks or tools, they'll have <br/>
more colors and sizes of ink pads than you can shake a stick out--so <br/>
hopefully it wasn't a total waste!  =)<br/>

was quite impressed with their selection of scented ink pads, <br/>

What a pity! But did you see the Herons on the nest? There should be<br/>
young visible soon, if not already!<br/>

The clues and hiding place are the same. Hopefully, it hasn't gone<br/>
walkabout again. I replaced it and checked on the Discovery Trail box<br/>
on the same day not long ago. Funhog<br/>
