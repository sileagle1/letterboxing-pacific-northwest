<br/>
The pertinent topic during the last session Friday was more-than-overflowing, and since it was given again Saturday, snuck out for the rest of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Went up to Mt. Tabor for Der Mad Stamper's infamous box.  Looked around, located the 'right spot', and found the box.  Very interesting reading the log book, agree that it is a great hide.  Had to avoid the several cross country teams that were practicing hills in the park.  So much energy, why is it wasted on the youth?<br/>
<br/>
Went to Crystal Springs, beautiful park, need to go back when the Rhodies are in bloom!  Lots of duck enjoying the water and logs and shore, very few of them were bothered when I walked by.  A bit of panic, there was a baggie on the trail, with a few holes in it.  Persevered, found the location, found the box, stamped in.  <br/>
<br/>
Went to find the Doyle Owl.  Wandered the campus, trying to imagine what it was like when my Grandmother went there.  Enjoyed the walk around the lake, but...  no success.  Looked and looked, went back around the lake, finally got too dark to see much of anything, so stumbled home.<br/>
<br/>
There was a recent message about the ACE OF FUN.  I had read the clues before, but not knowing Portland as well as most Portlanders, went on by.  This piqued my interest, so gave it some thought while doing some mindless spreadsheeting.  Figured it out! (or so I thought)  Arrived at that guaranteed correct location about 10:10 PM Thursday, wandered around for a half hour looking, but did not find it.  Will definitely try again, when the sun is out!<br/>
