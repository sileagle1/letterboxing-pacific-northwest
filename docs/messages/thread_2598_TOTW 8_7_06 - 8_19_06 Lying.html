My twin nephews don't like to go letterboxing.  Whenever we go to visit my sister we all go out boxing together.  She thinks it's fun.  They think it stinks.  So now we hide my boxin' bag in my back pack and we take off.  By the time we get out and about and they realize we are boxing, they are stuck with us.  They moan a little, but we still box.  After a few trips one of them has come over to the dark side, but the other holds firm that boxin' is "no fun!". Even after following the map looking for "Pirate's Treasure"... <br>
Go figure.<br>

  Since things have been rather quiet lately, I've switched the Topic of <br>
  the Week from 1 week, to 2. This question is funny, and I'm hoping it <br>
  will get some good response:<br>
<br>
  Have you ever told a lie in order to go letterboxing?<br>
