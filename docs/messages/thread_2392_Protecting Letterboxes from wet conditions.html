bought some small wide mouth water bottles that we have covered with <br/>
black duct tape to camoflouge them and will be placing our stamps in <br/>
these when we get back to boxing again (in better weather). They sell <br/>
them in the $1 area at Target and we bought a bunch when they <br/>
clearanced them off for .25 a piece a few months ago. I noticed the <br/>
other day that they have them for sale again (although they're at a $1 <br/>
a piece right now, which still isn't a bad price for a good container).<br/>
