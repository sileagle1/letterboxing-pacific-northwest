County: Clackamas<br>
State: OR<br>

Difficulty: easy<br>
<br>
Directions: Frog park is the affectionate name my kids and I have <br>
given Hillendale Park, 19260 Clairmont Way, Oregon City.<br>
During the spring we have had lots of fun catching the giant <br>
tadpoles of bullfrogs. In the fairness to our naturalist friend Wild <br>
Woman I must inform you bullfrogs are not native to Oregon. They are <br>
destroying native species of Oregon frogs and they are bad for <br>
Oregon. (But we still think they are fun to catch!)<br>
<br>
Clues: Find the pile of boulders. Walk down the path around the play <br>
structure to the bridge.  Wander through the trees seeking a home <br>
for night friends. Directly across the water count 3 trees to the <br>
left. In the heart is the creature you seek.<br>
