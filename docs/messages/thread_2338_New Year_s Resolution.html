this year.  That's nearly 2 per week.  It will be interesting to see how we <br/>
do since we don't live in the middle of Portland or Seattle.  It will be a <br/>
good reason to get out there and get some more exercise.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know about boxes in Port Townsend?  We'll be there this <br/>
weekend, but without cars, so we need to get to any boxes by bus.  We found <br/>
a new one at Fort Worden a while ago, and I see that there were some others <br/>
there, but the clue links are broken and I don't know how to find them or if <br/>
they're even there.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all have a great 2006.<br/>
