Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I am living in Portland, OR right now, but I am originally from San<br/>
Francisco. I am returning to visit my family in two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I want to go letterboxing while I am there! I started this hobby not<br/>
long ago, so this will be my first opportunity to go outside of<br/>
Portland with it.<br/>
<br/>
I am a native San Franciscan (actually right in the city, not the SF<br/>
Bay Area), but a little rusty on some of the neighborhoods and names.<br/>
<br/>
I am also looking for clues for letterboxes along the way. I will be<br/>
with my Dad and my sister so they must be les than 1/2 mile off of<br/>
Interstate 5.<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations? <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Rebecca<br/>

I just came from the San Francisco area, after going on a road trip to <br/>
visit family and friends.  I think it's probably further out of your <br/>
way than you were wanting to go, but I placed a couple of boxes while <br/>
I was there.  One is in Berkeley, at Tilden Park east of the <br/>
university, and two are in the same place on Hwy 101 just north of the <br/>
Russian River near Hopland. (Those two are really easy to get from the <br/>
highway...it's just a turnout off the road!)  I'm hoping some people <br/>
will find these soon so I know if my directions actually lead you to <br/>
the boxes, or if I made some big mistake!<br/>

You can try using the Trip Planner on AQ.  <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/trp/<br/>
<br/>
It'll let you search for boxes within five miles of I-5 between <br/>
Portland and Sacramento.  (Since it doesn't go through SF, you can <br/>
also do a search for boxes within five miles of I-80, I think it is, <br/>
between Sacramento and SF.)<br/>
<br/>
Happy travels!<br/>
