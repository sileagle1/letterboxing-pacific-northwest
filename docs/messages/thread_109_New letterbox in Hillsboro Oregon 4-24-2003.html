Find the Chief Kno-Tah Mystery box, and you are on your way. <br>
(http://home.agalis.net/bcostley/Letterbox/knotah.htm)<br>
<br>
Within his stomping grounds you will find a lone standing smoke <br>
signal maker from modern times, different than all the rest. Look <br>
between it's cracking remains, among stones that move, you will find <br>
what you seek.<br>
<br>
Note: This can be a very heavily used area, use care for the watchful <br>
eyes of passer bys while searching. It can be extremely difficult to <br>
access during summer months, especially summer weekends as the <br>
location is used frequently for picnics and bbq's. Early Mornings and <br>
off season is best. Also this is a micro-box. So be sure to bring a <br>
pen and stamp pad. Happy Hunting!  <br>

disclaimer.  <br>

cold and rainy to see if any of the rocks moved and then I forgot <br>
about it!<br>
<br>
Looks like folks have some extra motivation to find the Chief!<br>
