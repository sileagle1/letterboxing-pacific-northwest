Cool! Get 'em while they're young... Just think of<br/>
what they'll be able to carve by the time they're grown.<br/>
Glad to hear that you're back at it. Salem needs you.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; After a long period of no letterboxing, I'm back into the swing and I <br/>
&gt; have some box updates.  I recently started an afterschool <br/>
&gt; letterboxing club at the school where I work and I've introduced 6 <br/>
&gt; young letterboxers to the hobby.  <br/>
<br/>
On another note, I had a grand weekend in sunny, <br/>
warm (!) Central OR. Saturday was big letterboxing fun <br/>
traipsing around with 4DToes and snagging two elusive <br/>
birder boxes. I'm sure Chessy's camouflage face paint and <br/>
fatigues made us virtually invisible to passing dog walkers, <br/>
all the better for letterboxing. Birder's stamps are a coloring <br/>
extravaganza. You always have to remember to bring <br/>
a full array of colored markers.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home, I checked on two of my boxes, Waterfowl<br/>
Highway (fine) and Crooked River Bridge (missing.) As sad<br/>
as it is to lose a letterbox, I'm glad to have the opportunity<br/>
to make a new and improved stamp. It will be hidden in a<br/>
different location in the same park so it will be an official new <br/>
letterbox when it finds its way out there.<br/>
<br/>
Before I headed back to the Willamette Valley, I made a copy of<br/>
TeamWARE's Timberline clue. My curiosity was piqued by the<br/>
idea that this box was meant to be accessible year round. I <br/>
couldn't imagine anything outdoors up there to be exposed <br/>
half the year much less twelve months. Sure enough, put this <br/>
one on your summer/early fall list. It's already under a foot of<br/>
snow and won't be seeing the light of day any time soon. The <br/>
sunset view was glorious but I will have to just wait until next<br/>
June to see this stamp. Funhog<br/>

been updated for November. The box has been moved, so if you happened to<br/>
print out the clues last month, you'll have to check for the update. 5<br/>
groups made it last month for the October stamps, lucky devils! Be sure to<br/>
catch these stamps before they're gone!<br/>
<br/>
And, if you want to make a day of it, there are several other boxes in the<br/>
area. Jay's Tool Box, You Betcha, Swan Lake, Healthy Living, A Rose By Any<br/>
Other Name, Blue Lake, Blue Lake Park, Multi Hound Canine Collection, Circus<br/>
Memories, Evil Genius, Der Saintly Stamper, Imagine, and Jungle Animals are<br/>
within 5 miles or so. Yellow Rose of Suffrage is out this way, but not<br/>
within my 5 mile radius.<br/>
