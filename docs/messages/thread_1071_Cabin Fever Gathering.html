<br/>
A little birdy told me that if four or more letterboxers get together for a<br/>
specific purpose it's a gathering! Sooo.. we have a name, The Cabin Fever<br/>
Gathering, and we have an event stamp.<br/>
<br/>
The plan is to meet at the Shari's on Beaver Creek Road in Oregon City on<br/>
Sunday at noon.  Those that wish to stamp into the Dead Horse Postal<br/>
Letterbox may do so, those that don't may get my beautiful stamp carved<br/>
while trying to maintain sanity being locked in this house!<br/>
<br/>
If you need more information, feel free to email me.  If you're planning on<br/>
attending please let me know, as I want to make sure we have enough tables<br/>
together to kibbitz.<br/>
