I was just wondering if anyone ever found the Canadian Hitchhiker? It <br>
was stolen once but replaced and was curious as to it's <br>
whereabouts....Last I saw it was in Washington Park Portland Oregon.<br>
<br>
The Bear Hitchhiker must have been picked up by now too...it was last <br>
seen in Portland Oregon near Reed College. Did anyone see it? <br>
<br>
The new Hitchhiker was placed by the Secret Gardners and I heard may <br>
be in the Clark County area. The Bunny I believe it goes by.<br>
