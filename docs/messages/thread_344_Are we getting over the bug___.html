Scarey, but we have the same feelings,  everywhere we go there is letterbox stamp or placement potential, and even our 1st box will be on our wedding day.  <br>

They also have an office in a building right next to the ferry dock in downtown Seattle. They're on the 4th floor of a building where I used to work (I worked for some architects, who have since moved out of the building. There are 12 architect firms in that building.). They have all those fun movie posters in their windows. Real nice folks. (:  I remember thinking, "Is that really Pixar?? In this hideous building??"  That must be why they have no debt...cheap rent.

We are now proud owners of a new (old-reclaimed fir flooring yet to <br>
be refinished) kitchen floor!!!  ;)  Next come the cabinets, <br>
appliances and countertops.  Then, it's tile work...<br>
<br>
Yep, we're moving (kicking & screaming all of the way) to Augusta, <br>
GA for 9 months (we don't like HOT and we REALLY don't like <br>
HUMIDITY).  Then who knows where (most likely overseas) after that.  <br>
Typical chaotic military life...<br>
