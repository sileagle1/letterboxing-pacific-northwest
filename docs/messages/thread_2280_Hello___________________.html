Hope everyone is enjoying Fall.  The leaves are beautiful!!!  We went <br/>
for a walk around the Nature Park this past weekend and I just checked <br/>
on the boxes that I knew of there, but I am thinking they are ALL <br/>
GONE..........?????  That is such a great park, maybe we need to talk <br/>
to the rangers again and see what we can do about planting them there <br/>
again??  Just a thought!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!!!<br/>

I actually bumped into the Paisley Orca when I was in Portland for<br/>
jury duty. =) I went out for a lunch break and was walking along the<br/>
waterfront there and who should I see but the Orca herself!<br/>
<br/>
I told her about the South Sound Letterboxing Quest Fest #2 in the<br/>
hopes she'd show up (she said it's been AGES since she last checked<br/>
the board), but I guess she couldn't make it. =(<br/>
<br/>
But she's otherwise alive and well. =)<br/>

hey "BoB"!!!!,<br/>
<br/>
We had such a great time at Jazzercise. I think Penny was shocked that <br/>
we actually showed up!!!  It was fun, they really do a workout!!!  We <br/>
will have to head over that way again and get some boxing done, then <br/>
do to a Jazzercise class!!<br/>
<br/>
What fun,<br/>
