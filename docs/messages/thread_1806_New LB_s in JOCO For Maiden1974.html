Hi :o) Thanks for the info :o) but I looked all over "Team Nashoba" <br>
website looking for her email adress and looked on atlas quest and <br>
lbna for a contact placer option because I wanted to email her and <br>
let her know the county but wasnt able to find any way to contact her <br>
and gave up after 45 minutes, her website is very cute though, I <br>
particularly enjoyed "tanks diary" and also wanted to contact her <br>
about therapy dog training. I have a golden retriever that I would <br>
love to make into a therapy dog but dont know how to go about it. If <br>
you know how to contact her, I would certainly appreciate the email <br>
adress or she can contact me here. Thanks :o)<br>
