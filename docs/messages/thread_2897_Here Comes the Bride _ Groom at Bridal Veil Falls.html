destination for a couple of letterboxers in love.  So, let's have a <br/>
little Oregon wedding reception for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Join us for a Meet &amp; Greet at Bridal Veil Falls State Park on Saturday, <br/>
May 24 at 3pm.  Yes, I know that is an appropriately named location  <br/>
that's why I chose it.   We'll be at the picnic tables or nearby (if <br/>
I'm not quick enough to get dibs on the tables).  I'll have some light <br/>
refreshments available.  Atomic Beans may bring us some wedding favors <br/>
too a few of the stamps from their `Letterboxing Wedding'.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We also can't wait to find some of the great letterboxes that we've <br/>
heard about from others.  Since there are so many and I really need to <br/>
narrow down the list somehow, I'd love to hear what some of your <br/>
favorite, must-get boxes are.  We'll be in Portland for about a day, <br/>
traveling down the coast for 2, spending about 1 in the Vancouver, WA <br/>
area, and 2-3 along the Gorge.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you in May! :)<br/>
