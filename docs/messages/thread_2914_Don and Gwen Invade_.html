sweet, funny and curmudgeonly couple (you pick who gets which<br>
adjectives) will travel this summer in Oregon is Suttle Lake. Seems<br>
like a perfect, central location for many Oregonians. How's about a<br>
BBQ at their campground on Sunday July 27th? Bring flowers or rotten<br>
tomatoes, your choice. <br>
<br>
Naw, really bring selves and food to eat. Then there's ink, logbooks,<br>
boots and a sense of humor. Funhog<br>

Although I don't get the reference to tomatoes and/or boots, I am<br>
interested to find out and will be there.  Have come close to meeting<br>
these two a couple of times, looking forward to actually doing so. <br>
Sounds like a good excuse to haul our RV up there and stay a few<br>
nights myself.<br>
