Well I was off hiking around Mercer Island and found some other <br>
letterboxers out and about. The Bisons and I did find two boxes <br>
however were stumped on the third. We suspect is may be <br>
missing....The Heart of Lake Washington box.....and with my bad luck <br>
I lost my compass! It was a gift from my grandparents way way back. <br>
So just incase anyone was out and about on Sunday and picked it up <br>
please let me know.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

Sorry to hear about your missing compass.  I, too, lost my compass <br>
somewhere last week between Newport Beach and Big Sur, CA.  :(  The <br>
last three days of our 18 day 'letterboxing' tour of CA, OR & WA was <br>
compass-less.  For an interesting tidbit:  Sans compass, we actually <br>
found a letterbox we would NOT have found had we had our compass on <br>
us becuase we actually found another 'clueless' letterbox--which is <br>
still clueless to this day (at least, we can't locate clues for it <br>
still).  We poked around trees in the general location of where the <br>
clues said the letterbox we were ACTUALLY looking for was supposed <br>
to be--then we find a letterbox thinking it was the one we were <br>
after; opened it up, saw it had a totally different name and was <br>
planted by a totally different group of letterboxers.  So, we <br>
stamped in and then set out hoping to find the ACTUAL letterbox for <br>
which we had clues--within 5 minutes we found THAT box, too.  We've <br>
been trying to locate the clues to the 'clueless' one we found ever <br>
since--but to no avail.  Anybody know where we can find clues <br>
for 'Shell' LB in Carmel, CA?<br>
<br>
Anyways, the original Heart of Lake Washington Letterbox went <br>
missing a couple of years ago.  We planted a replacement in a new <br>
spot--posting new clues to it in the same park.  The replacement <br>
went missing several months ago and we retired the box assuming that <br>
the culprits who took the box HAD to have the clues to find it--<br>
since it was hidden in a unique manner.  So, the clues to the <br>
replacement letterbox have indicated it is, indeed, missing and that <br>
we retired the replacement letterbox ever since we confirmed it was <br>
missing.  I don't have any way to amend the original Heart of Lake <br>
WA clues because Modern Gypsy is the one who entered those into the <br>
dbase.  Sorry about your unfortunate day.  :(  We spend a LOT of <br>
time on MI (thank my work commitments for that), so we'll keep our <br>
eyes open for your compass.<br>
