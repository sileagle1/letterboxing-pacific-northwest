I'm glad you got it all worked out and sorry it caused you sp much distress.<br>
Please be sure when driving to replace the box today that you control the<br>
steering wheel with you're your left foot and the gas and break with your<br>
right, otherwise you'd be a pretzel and could get into a serious accident.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I dunno I personally think the whole thing got blown into dynamic<br>
proportions as is very common in our hobby and is a great example that we<br>
all need to practice some basic forms of communication.<br>
<br>
Having taken several psychology courses I can guarantee that one of the<br>
biggest errors we all make when reading emails is that we assume we know<br>
what the other person meant half the time.  Something we might all want to<br>
think about doing the next time we read something that gets our feathers<br>
ruffled is to take the time to ask the writer if our interpretation of their<br>
words is correct.  One of the tremendous downfalls of communicating in an<br>
internet medium is the lack of tone, gesture and body language which all add<br>
to our ability to comprehend the context in which something is said.<br>
<br>
As for last wills and testaments, I apologize to those I may offend with<br>
this -- but I think it is going quite a bit overboard.  I can honestly say<br>
that while I would want my boxes retired as well, should I ever leave the<br>
world of letterboxing be that of my own choice or my untimely departure, the<br>
last thing I'm concerned with is what the rest of the world does with my<br>
letterboxes.  I think when we start writing last wills and testaments and<br>
leaving do not resuscitate orders on our boxes we need to ask ourselves if<br>
this has gone beyond a fun hobby, a enjoyable sport and became too much of a<br>
life altering event.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents -- which only amounts to two pennies,<br>
