The boss said we had to go home early (something about moving the network computers so we might as well go home :-) so I stopped by Tumwater Historical Park.  There are seven (or was it six?) picnic tables by the playground, and there is one post mounted grill you could build a fire in, but the grate looked like a hot dog would fall thru.  A grill might be a good idea.  <br>
<br>
The geese and ducks were enjoying the water, the sun was out, the letterbox was there, the playground was inviting.<br>
<br>
See everyone there!<br>

  We're bringing 6, possibly 8 (depends on the old CME conference <br>
  schedule).  As for grills, I think there are permanently mounted <br>
  grills someplace in the park but can't remember if there are any <br>
  adjacent to the big kids' playground.  The 'picnic tabled' area of <br>
  the park is not that large so we can definitely work something out <br>
  if necessary.  I have on other occasions seen large groups of folks <br>
  using the pavilion (which you must reserve with beaucoup $$$) who <br>
  have hauled in there entire backyard gas grills and home stereo <br>
  systems.  Pretty crazy but it all depends on the size of the group.  <br>
  I think that particular group was hosting a family reunion.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Can't wait to meet you all soon,<br>
