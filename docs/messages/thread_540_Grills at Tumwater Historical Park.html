The boss said we had to go home early (something about moving the network computers so we might as well go home :-) so I stopped by Tumwater Historical Park.  There are seven (or was it six?) picnic tables by the playground, and there is one post mounted grill you could build a fire in, but the grate looked like a hot dog would fall thru.  A grill might be a good idea.  <br/>
<br/>
The geese and ducks were enjoying the water, the sun was out, the letterbox was there, the playground was inviting.<br/>
<br/>
See everyone there!<br/>

  We're bringing 6, possibly 8 (depends on the old CME conference <br/>
  schedule).  As for grills, I think there are permanently mounted <br/>
  grills someplace in the park but can't remember if there are any <br/>
  adjacent to the big kids' playground.  The 'picnic tabled' area of <br/>
  the park is not that large so we can definitely work something out <br/>
  if necessary.  I have on other occasions seen large groups of folks <br/>
  using the pavilion (which you must reserve with beaucoup $$$) who <br/>
  have hauled in there entire backyard gas grills and home stereo <br/>
  systems.  Pretty crazy but it all depends on the size of the group.  <br/>
  I think that particular group was hosting a family reunion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Can't wait to meet you all soon,<br/>

  &gt; Yes please respond soonest, we'll provide a grill if needed.  I'm <br/>
  planning on dogs and burgers to feed 50 or so, including kids.<br/>

  &gt;   That would be fantastic!  I don't know how many will be there, <br/>
  the chats may <br/>
  &gt;   give some clue.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   My recollection is that the picnic area by the playground <br/>
  doesn't have any <br/>
  &gt;   cooking facilities, just picnic tables.  I can stop by and look, <br/>
  post it to the <br/>
  &gt;   chat list when I verify what is (or isn't) there.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   Looking forward to a great time!!!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   We can also discuss how Washington Counties are regionalized, <br/>
  see if there is <br/>
  &gt;   any concensious (sp???) on how South Puget Sound and SouthWest <br/>
  Washington <br/>
  &gt;   should be divvied up.<br/>
