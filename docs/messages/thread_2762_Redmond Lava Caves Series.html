there as well; I planned to remove them and realized I didn't know<br>
what I'd do with them so I kept them in the boxes. Two for the price<br>
of one!<br>
<br>
No. 1 is also new because the old one got eaten by a backhoe, so if<br>
you've visited these boxes already you can experience deja vu and get<br>
new stamps!<br>

place, we really enjoyed being there last year.  I recommend these <br>
boxes to anyone who happens to be in the area.  New stamps, what a <br>
great reason to go there again!  <br>
