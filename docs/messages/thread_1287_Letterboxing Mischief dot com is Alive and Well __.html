Wow I really let letterboxingmischief.com fall behind.  It all <br>
started with house buying/selling last spring and then a surgery<br>
<br>
Well spring has sprung, and I have myself a little letterboxing list <br>
of To Do's.  <br>
<br>
Now that the site is up to date, I'm going to start checking on my <br>
letterboxes next, for upkeep/repair.<br>
<br>
Redmond Elementals<br>
Down for repairs (2 missing stamps).  Expect it back by Memorial Day<br>
<br>
Snoqualmie Fall Series<br>
I believe #3 is missing (again) and I've already carved a <br>
replacement stamp.  I'm also planning on adding a bonus stamp.  Stay <br>
tuned.<br>
<br>
Langley<br>
Got a replacement stamp ready.  It's just a little bit of a hassle <br>
to get out there.  I expect this will be the *last time* I replace <br>
this box.  Stay tuned.<br>
<br>
I'll be checking on all my others too this spring.  Then I can get <br>
to the business of planting *new* boxes.  Woo!  =D<br>
<br>
Oh ya and I get to find new boxes too!<br>
<br>
Wheeee<br>
