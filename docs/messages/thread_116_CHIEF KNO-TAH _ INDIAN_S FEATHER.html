Now Wingnut, Indian's Feather may be your first stamp placed, but I do<br>

more of your creations in the future.<br>

Thanks for placing!  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">(Blushing) Thanks for the praise. My head would be in danger of <br>
getting really big but I was fortunate enough to recieve in the mail <br>
today a postcard from a famous east coast letterboxer with some <br>
stamps that really blew me away. So I'm back to my humble self. :)<br>
<br>
If you want to know how I carved the chief visit our page at:<br>
http://home.agalis.net/bcostley/Letterbox/PSinst.htm<br>
<br>
I used that method plus I had Grace (21 months old) crawling over me <br>
(and "helping") while I worked. I think she was the secret charm! <br>
All I used was the number one speedball blade and x-acto knife. X-<br>
acto just used for the outer shape. For this stamp I made the <br>
printout negative so I could carve away the black - sometimes that <br>
can be easier on a detailed stamp where you need to carve away lots <br>
of little things.<br>
<br>
Ditto the wish that Wingnut places more boxes, certainly a great <br>
first box!<br>

publish them!  Which I will do here shortly.  Hope you find time to <br>
look for this one also!  No chance in scaring me off, like Cariekins <br>
said, I'm a LB monster, even my dh rolls his eyes at me at times, <br>
lol!  I plan to try the same method used on the Chief Kno-Tah stamp, <br>
and practice practice practice.  I think I need a finer carving <br>
instrument......  I am a perfectionist, and will strive to meet the <br>
quality of the best!  (lol, did I mention neurotic too, lol, and <br>
maybe a bit obsessive complulsive and and and, not really) Wingnut<br>

out running errands and were near where I suspected these <br>
boxes to be.  We strolled around the area & Orc Boy found <br>
Indian's Feather in a heartbeat!  Major bummer.... we were <br>
without any LB equipment!!  I was looking around for something <br>
to make a stamp impression.  All we had was a stub of pencil... <br>
so we left our mark and returned the Feather to its home.  On to <br>
the chief......  Circled him twice before I spotted the container.... <br>
very crafty!!!  Really bummed not to have gotten that image.  We <br>
will have to return for that!<br>
