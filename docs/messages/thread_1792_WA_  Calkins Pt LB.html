You'll never guess this but...yet, another 'confirmed missing' (&amp; <br/>
killed off) letterbox has reappeared on the scene--unharmed and <br/>
highly visited. Hmmmm.....????  Yes, Quilting Noni, rnrB &amp; trkr went <br/>
to hang out near a beach today to look for Bald Eagles and decided <br/>
to check the Calkins Point LB hiding spot on a whim.  Imagine their <br/>
surprise when they found the 'long lost' letterbox there safe &amp; <br/>
sound!!!  Last time I checked on it (several months ago), we were <br/>
there at about 0730 and had the place to ourselves which guaranteed <br/>
total privacy as we tried to retrieve the box.  I reached into the <br/>
hiding spot as far as my 'longer than Quilting Noni's' arm could <br/>
reach and found nothing but mud, trash and multiple glass beer <br/>
bottles.  I tried again with a long stick in my hand--no luck.  The <br/>
letterbox was HISTORY!!!  I even 'killed' the box on the clue site <br/>
thinking the spot was compromised.<br/>
<br/>
Well, as of today, this letterbox is back on the scene, alive &amp; well <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Another great ending to an odd mystery...<br/>
