Announcing the first ever Joker's Wild Letteboxing Poker Run!<br>
<br>
When?<br>
~October 1st, 2005<br>
Register and get your packet from 9:30  9:55 AM. The poker run<br>
begins at 10:00 exactly. You DON'T want to be late!<br>
<br>
Where?<br>
~Oxbow Regional Park in Gresham, Oregon. Exact location<br>
within the park to follow as the date gets closer.<br>
<br>
What is a Poker Run?<br>
~Definition: A Poker Run is an organized motorcycle event where<br>
riders travel over a prescribed course and at designated<br>
stopping points, select a card. At the end of the run, the person<br>
with the best poker hand wins a prize. But we decided to change<br>
it a bit and make it a letterboxing event. 53 cards will be hidden in<br>
the park. At 10:00 you will receive clues to the cards. Without<br>
knowing which card is at which location, you have to find 7 cards<br>
and make the best hand you can in two hours.<br>
<br>
Are there prizes?<br>
~Of course!<br>
<br>
Is it kid friendly?<br>
~You bet.<br>
<br>
What about lunch? I'm going to be hungry after finding all those<br>
boxes!<br>
~We will have a potluck. Bring a main dish or salad to share<br>
along with beverages for your family. We'll provide paper<br>
products and dessert!<br>
<br>
Can I stay the night?<br>
~Oxbow's campsites are open year-round and available on a<br>
"first-come, first-served" basis. Maximum occupancy is six<br>
people and two cars per site. Firewood is available for purchase<br>
at $4 per bundle. Camping fee is $15 per night. There is also a<br>
$4 per vehicle entrance fee to the park.<br>
<br>
Please RSVP to Maiden at maiden1974@... or at<br>
Atlasquest under gatherings. We hope to see you there!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a reminder for those of you that are planning on going to the <br>
gathering on October 1 (and we hope there are many of you).  Oxbow <br>
Park has a NO DOG policy.  Dogs are not even permitted in the park <br>
(unless they are service dogs).  The Wonder Whippets were planning <br>
on going with us to camp there, but they will have to sit this one <br>
out, and boy, are they annoyed.<br>

Here is the web site for more information on Metro's Dog Policy.<br>
<br>
No-dogs policy<br>
http://www.metro-region.org/article.cfm?articleID=161<br>
<br>
In order to protect wildlife habitat, and for their own safety, pets <br>
are not permitted at any Metro park, greenspace or facility. <br>
Functioning seeing-eye dogs or other service animals are permitted <br>
with proper identification and cleanup materials.<br>
<br>
Understanding Metro's no-pets policy<br>
We are frequently asked about the reason for Metro's no-dogs-allowed <br>
policy (Metro Regulatory Code, Title 10.01.220). The primary reason <br>
for the rule is the conflict pets (particularly dogs) produce in <br>
parks and natural areas managed for fish and wildlife habitat and <br>
large gatherings of people in Metro's developed park facilities.<br>
<br>
For example, Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area and Oxbow <br>
Regional Park are open year-round for public use and enjoyment, but <br>
these natural areas are managed in a way that protects habitat for a <br>
wide variety of fish and wildlife species. Visitors to these places <br>
have a unique opportunity to experience native plants and animals in <br>
a natural environment. Dogs, by nature, can significantly alter a <br>
visitor's experience and can damage sensitive habitats or restored <br>
habitat sites as well as harass or kill vulnerable wildlife.<br>
<br>
The no-dogs policy also applies to heavily-used parks such as Blue <br>
Lake Regional Park. On a busy summer day at Blue Lake, there are <br>
often as many as 8,000 people picnicking, walking, biking, swimming <br>
and playing various field games in the park. A crowded environment <br>
such as this can prove to be unsafe for people as well as for pets.<br>
<br>
A dogs-on-leash rule has proved ineffective in the past, because <br>
many people disregard the policy. We also have experienced that a <br>
number of pet owners do not take the responsibility to pick up pet <br>
waste. Patrolling park grounds to assure that dogs are under <br>
control, contacting those who are not being responsible with their <br>
pet and cleaning up after pets to assure a safe visitor environment <br>
has proved to be an inefficient use of very limited staff time.<br>
<br>
With the exception of special service dogs, Metro will continue its <br>
current policy of excluding pets from their parks and natural areas <br>
to help assure a quality visitor experience and help protect the <br>
natural resource values in these places.<br>
<br>
