<br>
For those interested, the restaurant is the Blue House Cafe which is <br>
located a few miles north of Vernonia, OR on highway 47. It serves <br>
very good Mediterranean food and is worth visiting just for that. <br>
Beers on sale now are an oatmeal porter and a pale ale. In waiting are <br>
a Scottish ale and a cherry vanilla wheat beer.<br>
