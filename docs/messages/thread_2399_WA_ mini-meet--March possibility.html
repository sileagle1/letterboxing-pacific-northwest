                    <div class="plaintext-content">Interesting, I didn't realize that adventure seeker was your family name.  I<br>
actually have your kids' individual names listed as exchanges and yours for<br>
you.  I will try to remember the new name now too.<br>
<br>
I will be there from March 15th to the afternoon of the 21st.  Friday night<br>
probably won't be the best.  I need to meet up with my stepbrother then.  I<br>
will be taking care of him over the weekend.  If others wanted to meet then,<br>
I could probably pick him up earlier though.  He can come with me for things<br>
during the weekend, but I think the brunch might just be a bit much for<br>
him.  He doesn't do well with with long rides if it is a train ride.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure exactly where I am staying at yet.  I will find out and let you<br>
know.  I think I have an old family friend out on the same island as your<br>
family place (if I'm remembering the name right).  Can you tell that A-Bear<br>
and I were talking?  Anyway, I'm going to see if my old friend is going to<br>
be around.  I may just get a hotel room somewhere.  I'm not sure yet--we<br>
will see.  Over the weekend I will stay at my stepbrother's place, but I<br>
don't know which town it is in.<br>
<br>
Okay, I hope this note makes sense.  I just got back from performing with my<br>
chamber orchestra.  I also had about four hours of driving for my work today<br>
and I have to get up at 4am tomorrow.  I'm beat!<br>
<br>
until later,<br>
