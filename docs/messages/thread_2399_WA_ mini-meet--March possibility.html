                    <div class="plaintext-content">Interesting, I didn't realize that adventure seeker was your family name.  I<br/>
actually have your kids' individual names listed as exchanges and yours for<br/>
you.  I will try to remember the new name now too.<br/>
<br/>
I will be there from March 15th to the afternoon of the 21st.  Friday night<br/>
probably won't be the best.  I need to meet up with my stepbrother then.  I<br/>
will be taking care of him over the weekend.  If others wanted to meet then,<br/>
I could probably pick him up earlier though.  He can come with me for things<br/>
during the weekend, but I think the brunch might just be a bit much for<br/>
him.  He doesn't do well with with long rides if it is a train ride.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure exactly where I am staying at yet.  I will find out and let you<br/>
know.  I think I have an old family friend out on the same island as your<br/>
family place (if I'm remembering the name right).  Can you tell that A-Bear<br/>
and I were talking?  Anyway, I'm going to see if my old friend is going to<br/>
be around.  I may just get a hotel room somewhere.  I'm not sure yet--we<br/>
will see.  Over the weekend I will stay at my stepbrother's place, but I<br/>
don't know which town it is in.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I hope this note makes sense.  I just got back from performing with my<br/>
chamber orchestra.  I also had about four hours of driving for my work today<br/>
and I have to get up at 4am tomorrow.  I'm beat!<br/>
<br/>
until later,<br/>

&gt;  Yep, I heard you're coming out this way.  I just don't know if 'we'll'<br/>
&gt; be here then which is why I've hesitated to plan something yet.  Do you<br/>
&gt; have your dates yet?  You'll be in Seattle?  If so, what side of town?<br/>
&gt; I've got a few 'ideas' up my sleeve already but I'll need some more<br/>
&gt; time to see if I can coordinate anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We could do a dinner/or late afternoon thing (depending on when you're<br/>
&gt; in town).  Based on our recently affirmed La Nina affliction, I'd lean<br/>
&gt; toward doing something indoors now as anything outdoors is sure to be<br/>
&gt; waterlogged.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do have an idea about a train/brunch outing for the near future but<br/>
&gt; not sure if anybody else would be interested in that.  It'd run about<br/>
&gt; $45-65 per adult (depending upon brunch or dinner) and 2 children are<br/>
&gt; free per adult--at least through April that is, then they gotta pay,<br/>
&gt; too.  It'd be an entire afternoon or evening event that'd end with wine<br/>
&gt; tasting though and wouldn't involve much letterboxing unless folks<br/>
&gt; brought 'personal travelers' for which we must solve clues.  So that<br/>
&gt; might be an option for your visit or we could do something<br/>
&gt; less 'involved'.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; dlphinus of the Adventure Seekers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (by the way, here's the deal with the name change--dvn2r ckr<br/>
&gt; <adventures seeker=""> had always been our group name until I could come<br/>
&gt; up with a personal trail name--I'd had the name Delphinus in mind for<br/>
&gt; ages but yahoo ids are difficult to come by since every country on this<br/>
&gt; planet can create accounts there.  Finally, after 3-1/2 years, decided<br/>
&gt; to go with D<a umlaut="">lphinus instead so I could have my own Yahoo<br/>
&gt; userid without the 5 digit extension required for 'popular' names.  'A<br/>
&gt; umlaut' in German is the same sound as e in Latin so it works.  Since<br/>
&gt; most yahoo things don't allow umlauts I just spell it out 'ae'<br/>
&gt; instead.  So that's the deal with that.  I'll transition over to the<br/>
&gt; new email account in time.  Otherwise, same 'bat' dolphin, same bat<br/>
&gt; channel--that is, of course, until we move across the country and then<br/>
&gt; the frequency will change, too).  ;)<br/>
