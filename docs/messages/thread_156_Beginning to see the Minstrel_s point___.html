tow, in search of Funhog's Royal Angler.  We went this way, and tried that <br/>
way, and retraced our steps several times ("HEY!" said Heather's <br/>
kindergartener, "We already came this way!"  Here, hush up and eat another <br/>
granola bar, kid).  In desperation just before we finally did give up, H &amp; I <br/>
searched around a "nurse" we thought might be promising, but encountered <br/>
stinging nettle rather than a box (and all this time I kinda thought I was <br/>
immune to the stuff.  Well, you DO learn a lot while you're letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I learned was that Milo McIver is not well-marked (at least not <br/>
the southern portion) and that their map is nothing to write home about <br/>
either.  In the end, I am not sure we even STARTED in the right place--tho <br/>
there seemed no other choice.  <br/>
<br/>
So throw us a bone, Funhog, pluuu-ease!  The parking area for "F" picnic area <br/>
wasn't listed on the map, so we could only guess it was the lot near the <br/>
southern boat dock.  Is that right?  (The hatchery is down in that area, so I <br/>
think we must have been right at least about that...)  Then we walked past <br/>
the boat dock and back up the road, as instructed, and took the esquestrian <br/>
trail (from the road, with the river at our backs, it was on the left) marked <br/>
with three concrete posts.  There was another trail a bit farther on, with <br/>
wooden posts...now I'm wondering if it's possible the concrete posts have <br/>
been added since the clues were written??  But wait...that trail would have <br/>
been even FARTHER away from the river, which we were supposed to follow at <br/>
some point, but never saw again after leaving the parking lot.  <br/>
<br/>
So what the heck?  <br/>
<br/>
On the plus side, it was a LOVELY day, we got some good exercise, and the <br/>
swelling &amp; itching will go down in a few days....<br/>
