&gt; Turns out Saltars Point in Steilacoom is a well-visited letterbox.  <br/>
&gt; So much so, that I had to replace the log already.  I also took the <br/>
&gt; opportunity to replace the rudimentary stamp with a slightly <br/>
&gt; improved rudimentary stamp.  Enjoy--if it's worth anything to you!<br/>

&gt; Cold Moon over Puget Sound wasn't faring so well.  Since I placed <br/>
&gt; it, I thought I would be able to find it again--after visiting it <br/>
&gt; about a dozen times over the course of the past year.  No such luck-<br/>
