                    <div class="plaintext-content">The map (as we currently have it) is posted under the Files <br/>
Section.  I'll add Vancouver as a city name to it and then wait for <br/>
any more guidance for additional breakouts (counties or regions).<br/>
<br/>
I just studied Boxopolis Connecticut's map and saw that their wee <br/>
state is broken up into quadrants with about 400 letterboxes per <br/>
quadrant--PLUS another 100 or so mystery LBs. (I'm wondering--does <br/>
WA even have 400 boxes total?)  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to balance a simple, streamlined map (in the traditional <br/>
feel of the 'classic' LBNA site) with one that is efficient and easy <br/>
to navigate. As we play around with different 'break outs' of <br/>
regions, it starts to get visually busy, pretty quickly.  <br/>
Personally, I'm leaning more toward merging Thurston &amp; Pierce and <br/>
standing King up individually.  If anything, it's easier on the eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know what you think about the modified map.  I want to <br/>
get this right before we send it off to 'map' the hyperlinks to the <br/>
dbase (to avoid extra work on behalf of others on that end). Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
One final thought - perhaps you should re-number the areas, to get <br/>
rid of 2a and 2b, and simply have 1-9?  You might number from eastern <br/>
regions (#1) to western (#9), such that the Western WA areas have <br/>
numbers 7,8,9.  That way, if down the road there are more "splits" <br/>
around the Sound, it will be easy to add area 10 and 11 in a way that <br/>
makes geographical sense.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, the re-numbering thing is a bit nit-picky, but otherwise I think <br/>
it's great - I'm glad you got a map that shows the Sound correctly - <br/>
that was bugging me.<br/>

Subject: [LbPNW] WA Map's up in the Files Section<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The map (as we currently have it) is posted under the Files <br/>
Section.  I'll add Vancouver as a city name to it and then wait for <br/>
any more guidance for additional breakouts (counties or regions).<br/>
<br/>
I just studied Boxopolis Connecticut's map and saw that their wee <br/>
state is broken up into quadrants with about 400 letterboxes per <br/>
quadrant--PLUS another 100 or so mystery LBs. (I'm wondering--does <br/>
WA even have 400 boxes total?)  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to balance a simple, streamlined map (in the traditional <br/>
feel of the 'classic' LBNA site) with one that is efficient and easy <br/>
to navigate. As we play around with different 'break outs' of <br/>
regions, it starts to get visually busy, pretty quickly.  <br/>
Personally, I'm leaning more toward merging Thurston &amp; Pierce and <br/>
standing King up individually.  If anything, it's easier on the eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know what you think about the modified map.  I want to <br/>
get this right before we send it off to 'map' the hyperlinks to the <br/>
dbase (to avoid extra work on behalf of others on that end). Thanks,<br/>

I had another idea up my sleeve but it'll take some more time and a lot <br/>
more education on my part.  ;)<br/>

I'd always thought it was strange that one goes from a map view (the US, then the state) to a list view for all the actual boxes.  I may have lived here all my life, but I still have trouble remembering where some of the smaller cities in the southern Puget Sound region are.  It makes it tougher to do trip planning when you have to locate the Thomas Guide and match things up.<br/>
<br/>
This involves a near overhaul of the whole site, but I think it would be neat if each of the areas linked to from the state map showed a region map.  Cities with boxes would be highlighted, and hovering would make a tag pop up with the number of boxes in that area (and the name if it's a smaller city and there's no room for the name on the map).  If you're looking for boxes on the border of two or three "regions," trip planning can become a biiig pain, since some cities are listed in several regions.  Each city could be a list, though.  Getting that particular could prove super difficult to update...<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea, but I know it would take a lot of work!!  But the new map is a nice improvement!!<br/>

&gt; Ok, the 'new' map is now loaded to the Files Section.  It has <br/>
&gt; eliminated Lewiston (why an Idaho town on a WA map?), greened in the <br/>
&gt; areas with letterboxes (anybody planning on planting any new LBs in <br/>
any <br/>
&gt; of the white areas in the very near future?--if so, let me know and <br/>
&gt; we'll go ahead and green them in now), the three counties around <br/>
&gt; Eastern Puget Sound are their own regions.  As I see it on this new <br/>
&gt; graphic, I think combining Pierce and Thurston Counties would be <br/>
okay <br/>
&gt; as the combined landmass isn't that large.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anybody else see anything that should be updated?  Still waiting for <br/>
&gt; comments from Clark County folks--do you want us to break out Clark <br/>
&gt; County into its own region or is it fine to stay where it is?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
