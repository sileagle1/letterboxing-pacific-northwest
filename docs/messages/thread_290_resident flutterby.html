<br>
What are your thought processes to get to the letterbox?  Maybe I can guide <br>
you that way?  <br>
<br>
I've revised Hint 2 to read:   Its in a clump of rocks, and when on the main <br>
path facing the sign, its on the right side of the clump.  Look under a low <br>
out crop of one of the rocks, covered with a bit of debris. Its approximately <br>
the forth rock back on the right side (or alternately, approximately the second <br>
to the farthest back), somewhere in that area. I am vague because I didn't <br>
count which rock it was exactly (How do you count a medley?), though I would <br>
recognize it if I saw it. As Funhog said to me later: "Supposedly that pile of <br>
basalt is a native plant garden by mid summer. I hate to think of folks trampling <br>
it looking for plastic." Good point. I'd hate to see that happen too. You can <br>
reach it from the path. Absolutely no trampling necessary.<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting!  <br>

Anyway. Hint 2 has improved since I read it! I was going to say it <br>
was on the SE side, 4th rock. Or you could say in the middle of the <br>
SE side. I found it by concentrating on the 4th rock hint. <br>
