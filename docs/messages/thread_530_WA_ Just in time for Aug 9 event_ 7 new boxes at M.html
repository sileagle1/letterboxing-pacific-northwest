has been placed at Millersylvania State Park just south of Tumwater, <br>

I will be bringing copies of the clues to the gathering on Saturday <br>
at Tumwater Historical Park.  I wont arrive until around noon so I <br>
thought it best to post the clues beforehand to allow visitors <br>
traveling from the south a chance to pick them up on the way to the <br>
gathering.<br>

Have fun,<br>

The word "strange" is appropriate, but "strangers" isn't.  One big happy group of enthusiasts that you haven't met all of yet (key word, yet!).  <br>
<br>
I also am basically shy, but both gatherings I have been to I have been welcomed, and had a great time, as you will when you join us.  <br>
<br>
Shirley you should be able to convince some other Oregonian to join you for some fun, X's, and new boxes.<br>
<br>
See you there!<br>

  Oh I wanna go!  But, actually being a bit shy in person, (ya, go <br>
  figure right) I can't stand the thought of the long drive alone to <br>
