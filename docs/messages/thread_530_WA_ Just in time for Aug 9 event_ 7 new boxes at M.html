I will be bringing copies of the clues to the gathering on Saturday <br/>
at Tumwater Historical Park.  I wont arrive until around noon so I <br/>
thought it best to post the clues beforehand to allow visitors <br/>
traveling from the south a chance to pick them up on the way to the <br/>
gathering.<br/>

The word "strange" is appropriate, but "strangers" isn't.  One big happy group of enthusiasts that you haven't met all of yet (key word, yet!).  <br/>
<br/>
I also am basically shy, but both gatherings I have been to I have been welcomed, and had a great time, as you will when you join us.  <br/>
<br/>
Shirley you should be able to convince some other Oregonian to join you for some fun, X's, and new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!<br/>
