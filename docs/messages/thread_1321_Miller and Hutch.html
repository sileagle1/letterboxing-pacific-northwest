of which was Miller and Hutch's 5th box. If you know who they are, or know<br>
how to get hold of them, or if you ARE them, they need to know that their<br>
5th box is now the home to an ant colony. Thank goodness for rubber gloves<br>
in letterboxing bags. I had to dig the box out of the ant colony, empty the<br>
millions of ants out of the box, out of all three bags, and then try to<br>
stamp in without being to grossed out. We cleaned out as much as we could<br>
and double bagged everything.<br>
<br>
We also picked up three other boxes while out driving around and Tooth Fairy<br>
got her 100th box by resucing Puff the Magic Dragon.<br>

Thank you so much.<br>
<br>
I also checked on my Clackamas Carasouel box, to find that someone had<br>
sharpened the pencil I had used for the book.. It wasn't supposed to be a<br>
pencil.. it was supposed to be my carasouel pole.. Oh well.. I'll have to<br>
return and fix it soon. Lots of new boxers had stamped in to the book, with<br>
only two stamps I recognized. It looks like the activity in that area is<br>
picking up! So everyone get out there and box!<br>

  I happened to be in the area and discovered that one of Miller and Hutch's<br>
boxes was in IMMEDIATE danger of being destroyed due to construction so I<br>
picked it up and have it in my possession. As soon as the construction is<br>
complete I will return it to its exact location.<br>
