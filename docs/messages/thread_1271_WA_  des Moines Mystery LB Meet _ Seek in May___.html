<br/>
WHAT:  des Moines wa Mystery letterbox Meet &amp; Seek in May<br/>
<br/>
WHEN:  29 May 04, Saturday<br/>
<br/>
TIME:  specific time TBD but plan on formal stuff kicking off around <br/>
2-3 pm'ish and finishing up after dinner or whenever you'd like to <br/>
leave depending upon when our guest(s) of honor arrive--we'll tweak <br/>
the time after we get more specific travel info from our guest(s)<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Des Moines Beach Park (whereever the picnic tables are--<br/>
park recon to follow)--exactly 3.2 miles West of I-5 Exit 149B!!!<br/>
<br/>
WHO:  Anybody who is interested in letterboxing or bring along those <br/>
buddies of yours whom you're just dying to introduce to letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
MYSTERY: ???  This event will culminate with honoring some special <br/>
guest(s) who will visit the Puget Sound region.  I'd tell you who it <br/>
is but then that wouldn't be any fun, would it?  Kind of like <br/>
knowing where the letterbox is before you read the clues...  Just <br/>
know that you'll be very excited to have a certain signature stamp <br/>
or two in your logbook after attending this event!!!<br/>
<br/>
FOOD/FUN:  Potluck is the best &amp; easiest way to go.  Bring enough <br/>
food/drinks/supplies for your group and to share with others.  <br/>
Previous events have been a gourmet afficionado's dream!!!  You <br/>
won't be hungry after this event!!!<br/>
<br/>
Other details to come as we go along...<br/>
<br/>
If you're itching to plant a letterbox or two, get 'em planted <br/>
before the event.  I recommend posting the clues a day or two before <br/>
the 29th so folks can print up the clues before they hit the road--<br/>
then they can spend Sat morning looking for the boxes before the <br/>
formal 'exchange' feeding frenzy begins.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I'm forgetting any details.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Des Moines Beach Park from Interstate-5 follow:<br/>
<br/>
At exit 149B, turn RIGHT onto Ramp (WA-516 / Des Moines) 0.3m<br/>
Turn RIGHT (West) onto SR-516 [S Kent des Moines Rd] 2.1m<br/>
Bear RIGHT (North-West) onto SR-509 [Marine View Dr S] 0.3m<br/>
Turn LEFT (West) onto S 223rd St 0.2m<br/>
Road name changes to Cliff Ave S 0.1m<br/>
Road name changes to Nebo Blvd 0.1m<br/>
Road name changes to Local road(s) &lt; 0.1m<br/>
End: Arrive Des Moines Beach Park<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can do a letterbox supply donation/exchange/freebie box if folks <br/>
are interested.  I've got tons of letterboxing supplies just waiting <br/>
to get into the hands of enthusiastic letterboxers.  Let me know if <br/>
you have any ideas for other events.<br/>
<br/>
As I'm not totally positive about the abundance of picnic <br/>
tables/benches at this facility, we may need to bring some <br/>
tables/chairs for the event, too--so please keep that in mind.<br/>
