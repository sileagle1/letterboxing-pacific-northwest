<br/>
I just found out about this list from the letterbox-usa yahoo group. <br/>
I'm new to letterboxing and new to this list. I love paper arts <br/>
(among many other hobbies), and in one of my paper arts newsletter, <br/>
the author talked about letterboxing and it sounded so intriguing, I <br/>
just had to check it out. This sounds like so much fun. <br/>
<br/>
I live in Dallesport, WA, just across the river from The Dalles in <br/>
Oregon. From the information I have obtained so far from various web <br/>
sites, the PNW has lots and lots of boxes. Whoo hoo!!! And I've been <br/>
carving rubber stamps off and on for several years.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to having lots of fun and maybe even meeting a few of <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
