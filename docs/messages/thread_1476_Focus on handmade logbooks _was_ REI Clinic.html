What is up with the focus on cheap memo pads?  I am in total agreement that<br>
finding a store bought stamp is a large disappointment and I personally<br>
would never put a store bought stamp in a letterbox, but I've found tons and<br>
tons of letterboxes that did not have handmade log books in them, and have<br>
used all sorts of different memo pads as log books when planting myself and<br>
this has never taken away from the experience for me.  Heck the dollar store<br>
has been my best friend.  I apologize if I am missing something, but when I<br>
find a letterbox with a handmade logbook, I think I sort of found something<br>
a little special, it's not the norm and not something I expect people to do,<br>
and therefore start feeling disappointed about if they don't. I mean after<br>
all the stamp goes with me in a form of an image, the logbook stays.<br>
<br>
I just recently learned how to make handmade logbooks, thanks to Funhog,<br>
when I took her class up in Longview - and my most recent boxes, because<br>
they were particularly special to me, all had handmade log books.  However I<br>
won't be putting handmade log books in every letterbox I plant.  <br>

The cheapy lined pads went against my artist side when I was placing<br>
my first <br>
boxes, but the accountant side won . Some miscreant stole the 2nd box<br>
 I <br>
placed (not the last time that happened!), but for some reason tore<br>
the <br>
stamped pages out of the logbook and left them in a ziplock baggy. <br>
I'm glad I <br>
was able to rescue them.  Sorry that they weren't on better paper. <br>
Two l'box <br>
pioneers stamped & one of them used a stamp carved by a third<br>
founding <br>
member of the letterboxing community.  Carved on one coast and<br>
stamped in <br>
on the other.<br>
<br>
I think the idea of a nicer logbook or pad represents a sort of<br>
reverence and <br>
respect for the art.   I still think you should use whatever is at<br>
hand.   There <br>
are several great aspects to letterboxing.  Your strength might be<br>
clues, <br>
another's might be ferreting out the best locations for a box. <br>
