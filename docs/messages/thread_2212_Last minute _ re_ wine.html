<br/>
We're leaving tonight and thought I'd check as to whether there are any <br/>
restrictions as to where wine is sold, and what days/hours it is sold.  <br/>
If I remember correctly, Oregon doesn't have "state liquor stores" <br/>
which we have run into in other states.  Also assume we could buy it on <br/>
Sundays, correct?<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations on where to buy wine while we're out there (other <br/>
than the wineries themselves).  Any favorite Oregon or Washington wines <br/>
that might be available?  (We tend to prefer reds).<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is a LB board, not a wine board, but thought I'd see if <br/>
anyone had some info/recommendations. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
