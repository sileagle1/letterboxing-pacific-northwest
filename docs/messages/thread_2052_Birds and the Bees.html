finally had the chance to check up on box 1 of the Birds and the Bee's<br>
series. This box had been reported missing 6 times, by very reliable boxers.<br>
BUT, it was right where I left it. So those that had been out boxing with me<br>
were the very first to stamp into this box. <br>
 <br>
Don't give up hope! <br>
