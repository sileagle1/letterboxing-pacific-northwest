Imagine if you will, the following conversation..........<br>
<br>
Her - "Look there honey.... It's 5 acres."<br>
Him - "That's nice."<br>
Her - "And it's got a shop already on it!"<br>
Him - "That's nice."<br>
Her - "Wait! A shop AND a garage. 2 car garage."<br>
Him - "That's nice."<br>
Her - "I'll bet you it's big enough to have a horse or two on it baby!"<br>
Him - "That's nice."<br>
Her - "It's got 2 full bathrooms and a dishwasher!"<br>
Him - "That's nice"<br>
Her - "Well, well.... Look at this...."<br>
Him - "What?"<br>
Her - "It's a 1/4 mile from the entrance to Rainbow Falls State park. With 7.5 miles of walking trails and 10 miles of equestrian trails."<br>
Him - "State Park? Trails?"<br>
<br>
The sound of keys on a keyboard being typed fast ensues and then.......<br>
<br>
Him - "Woohoo! Look at this, NO boxes are planted there! It's virgin territory!"<br>
Her - "That's nice."<br>
Him - "Oh yes! Lets buy the place!!!!!"<br>
Her - "Yes dear!"<br>

Well, I'd put that into the placed category and drop the found category by one, but that's just me.....  We've decided to add another letter to the end of our signature.  Just because there's no rules!!!  (grin)<br>
