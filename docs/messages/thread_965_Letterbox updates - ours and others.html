                    <div class="plaintext-content">We hit a couple of areas last weekend and thought we should give a bit of info about our findings.  Unfortunately we run out of light every time we head for Gabriel Park, so that isn't one of our conquests yet, tho we are very anxious to get back in there! <br/>
<br/>
By the way has anyone seen Joe Hitchhiker lately?  Ryan has not been updating his movements - has he left the country to avoid capture?<br/>
<br/>
First we checked out our Mill Mystery box - come on y'all it's easy!  And a short hike.<br/>
<br/>
We checked on DMS Multmonah Falls box - and it's neighbor, the Palms - doing just fine!  We had time for more but the snow was calling, so we took a drive up Larch Mtn. Road.  AWESOME!<br/>
<br/>
We went to Tualatin Hills and Ryan, true to his word with the gang in tow, replaced the missing ones and all boxes are right were they should be, HOWEVER, on the 20th of Nov. the rangers closed the Creek Trail due to mud and flooding.  We did have to replace the baggies of #4 and #5, the inside of the boxes were wet and the baggies had holes/rips.  They are cozy and happy now.<br/>
<br/>
We replaced box 3 for Wild Goose Chase, so this little series is Alive and Well. <br/>
<br/>
 While there, we watched 2 ladies handle a feeding frenzie of assorted winged creatures,  headed by a very large and noisey gray goose.  The ladies even have a "table" for him to eat at (talk about spoiled rotten!)  It was a very good thing we didn't have Tara with us on this outing! Thought nobody was playing frisbee this time.<br/>
<br/>
We went to get the Cedar Hills Twins, only to discover that we didn't have the clue page!  Go figure, we had the whole dang local binder, but it wasn't anywhere to be found. I have since remedied that and have a crisp new copy.<br/>
<br/>
 We were hungry and not satisfied with Krispy Kremes, we headed for the Noodle Me box, knowing that food and fun were nearby.    Alas, we think, that the box may have been too exposed and possibly confiscated.  Has anyone gotten this one?  We could have been in the wrong area, but not likely, the park is too tiny.  <br/>
<br/>
All in all a great weekend.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, there is a funny looking bird - the discription:<br/>
it is black with a bit of white, rotund body, it swims and flys, and on land has the funniest looking feet!  They are flat like a duck's but not webbed, and look like reeds (yellowish/green and black stripes). These feet are huge for the size of the bird. Clown feet.  We couldn't find it in our Audubon bird book.  <br/>
<br/>
 Thanks to all!<br/>

I haven't gotten any updates in I don't know how long about Joe's <br/>
travels.  I do keep my hitchhiker pages as up-to-date as I have <br/>
information for!<br/>
<br/>
I figured after this long without hearing something, he's probably <br/>
MIA.  But that's the thing--I can't really be sure.  Sometimes they <br/>
spend a suprisingly long period of time in a box before they <br/>
resurface again.<br/>

the HH isn't Joe. The box is a mystery box in the mid-west in case <br/>
any of you want to nab it and the HH. :)<br/>
