I'll be travelling to Portland for work a few times over the next year. <br>
My first trip will be this month and I'm hoping to snag a few boxes <br>
during my trip. I know absolutely nothing about the city, including <br>
geography, parks, or the transportation system.<br>
<br>
I'll be staying near the Lloyd Center in what I guess is the downtown <br>
area, and will be working close to the Rock Creek Campus of Portland <br>
Community College. Der Mad Stamper's RCC boxes are already on my list <br>
of boxes to get. <br>
<br>
Anyone have suggestions for others to get? I won't have access to a <br>
car, so public transport will be necessary to use. Any tips would be <br>
appreciated, as I feel like I'm travelling blindly - not knowing <br>
anything about what I've heard is a beautiful city!<br>

time, mind you, but could be done if you have some free time.  It's<br>
also a very beautiful park even without the boxes. <br>

With all of the rain, and it being my first time out in Portland (as <br>
well as only my third week on the job), I'm not sure I'll get out and <br>
about this time. But I do have more trips to Portland this year for <br>
work, so hopefully the rain will subside a bit and I can get out <br>
there and box! <br>
