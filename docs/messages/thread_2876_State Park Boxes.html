<br/>
Oddly enough WA state parks discourage the placement of letterboxes in their<br/>
parks.  You may want to consider going somewhere other than a state park.<br/>
Or somewhere with a park nearby, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be a misunderstanding on the part of the Parks &amp; Rec Commission.<br/>
I'm not sure but it appears they think we tear up the terrain.  As you<br/>
probably know, we're about NOT doing that.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So sorry if I threw a wet blanket on your plans.  But I thought you'd want<br/>
to know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxin'!<br/>

I'd love to see somebody create an AQ/MapQuest fusion, where you could put in a<br/>

  Sometimes people plant near a state park, so as to honor the park but not break rules.  Just something else to consider.<br/>

What I was actually getting at with my suggestion about checking parks against<br/>
AQ was, why limit yourself to just the park?  If you camp in, say,<br/>
Millersylvania State Park (assuming they have camping there) you might as well<br/>
see if there are any intriguing-sounding boxes in Tenino, Maytown, maybe even<br/>
Olympia if you want to go that far afield.  As well as checking out Wolfhaven,<br/>
obviously, but that's another kind of research.<br/>
