Between you PNW folk and I:<br/>
I have all the mechanisms for a box status set up already.<br/>
It just isn't active.<br/>
It fits into the whole scheme of tracking your PFX online.<br/>
You say you've been to a box, so it gets verified and you get a tally for your F<br/>
count.<br/>
And so on . . .<br/>
<br/>
Right now, your best bet is to email the box's placer and ask for a clue or ask<br/>
them to put a note on their box that it might be gone.<br/>
<br/>
But, if they're not an active 'boxer anymore and the webmasters have control of<br/>
their clue, should we put notes on boxes?  Maybe just one person couldn't find<br/>
it.  Do we put notes after two people say it's missing?  Three?<br/>
You get the point.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I removed two boxes in the transition, because a nearby box's log<br/>
was full of entries saying that no one could find those boxes.  I figured they<br/>
were long gone.<br/>
<br/>
There probably isn't a right answer to please everyone, as usual.<br/>

I've gotten as frustrated as you looking for what I later found were <br/>
missing boxes. But there are problems with trying to establish a <br/>
status system. Check the main list archives from about a year ago. I <br/>
managed to start a pretty nasty thread when I suggested the <br/>

<br/>
At one point early in my boxing career (four whole months ago), the number of <br/>
boxes I'd tried for exceeded the number I'd found--because it happened that <br/>
I'd gone after several boxes which had been missing for quite some time (as I <br/>
discovered when I reported them missing to the list-serve).  I'd begun to think <br/>
that most of the boxes on the site might be gone, and it looked like this new <br/>
little hobby of mine was going to be a frustrating one.  <br/>
<br/>
Just think of all the angst you'll save newbies and those who don't monitor <br/>
the list!  Many thanks for your efforts, and I'll look forward to when the <br/>
system is up &amp; running.<br/>

sense to tag the box "apparently missing, X number of boxers haven't<br/>

Yay, Wes!  I'm glad to hear about the new box-status system.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm just thinking that if someone plants a box, they are responsible for it or at least call it an orphan.<br/>
<br/>
  If it is reported missing, the boxer and the placer should communicate privately to confirm locations.  ie. I tried to reach Funhog but her email was full regarding the Metolius box.  But she still responded to the talk page, well done, Funhog.<br/>
<br/>
  If the placer fails to respond and several others have had the same response, the box should be pulled from the clue list.<br/>
<br/>
  If the placer wants it back on the list, they can replace it and have it added back onto the clue list and maybe modify the clues.<br/>
<br/>
  If the box is so difficult to find that the boxer has to "bulldoze" the area to locate it, it fails the "leave no trace" idea of the game and it needs a change of location or better clues to pinpoint the location anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The placer needs to stay active with their boxes, most seem to be well maintained simply from the responses of finders, but if they are not willing to verify and update the status when it goes missing, for example, like Ryan's webpage does, "Alive and well as of ddmmyy" , or "Last Checked: Never" ,then maybe a consensus or mass hunt should take place to put a box to bed (that could be fun in itself).  If nobody finds it, it gets removed from the list, end of frustration.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong,  we are having a ball trying to find the last 2 of Ryan's "Murder in Gabriel Park", but we are stymied. We have been told that all 6 are alive and well, that's the way it should be, we know they are there, we just don't know where.  But the ones that have had no response or acknowledgement from the placer should go byebye.        <br/>
