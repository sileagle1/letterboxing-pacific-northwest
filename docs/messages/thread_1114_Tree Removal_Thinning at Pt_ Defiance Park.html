                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, <br>
We were at Pt. Defiance Park today (got 2 of 4 boxes we were in <br>
search of) and found out that they will be doing some  <br>
clearing/thinning/dangerous tree removal in the park and on the side <br>
of Ft. Nisqually that the road follows to Camp Six. I've not been <br>
able to clarify with Metro Parks if the thinning/brush removal <br>
(supposedly to lower the fire hazard level) will include the Madrona <br>
area nor how far around the immediate Fort area that it will include. <br>
They have a sign posted at the Info Kiosk about it and one just <br>
outside the front of the fort by the corner lookout tower too..but <br>
they just mention the area in general. <br>
<br>
Metro Parks has also done alot of marking of trees in the <br>
entrance/front half of the park for removal. Apparently it has come <br>
to their attention that alot of the old hardwoods have some serious <br>
damage/rot/disease to them. I did notice some trees marked in the <br>
Picnic/Playground area outside the Zoo and one or two in the Rustic <br>
picnic area. THey have done extensive trail maintainence in the <br>
Rhodedendron Garden and have removed alot of English Ivy and trimmed <br>
the "brush" from that area.<br>
<br>
SO...When you are out reconiteering box locations and hiding boxes <br>
this next month keep this in mind! Even if we can't utilize that <br>
small area on the far side of the Fort for box hiding as part of the <br>
LeapDay Event we have plenty of other places to hide boxes around <br>
there!!<br>
