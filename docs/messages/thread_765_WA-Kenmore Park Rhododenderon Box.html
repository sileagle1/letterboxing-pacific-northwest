Letterboxers) just finished visiting our daughter in Kenmore, Wa. We <br/>
placed a letterbox in Kenmore Park and hope many of you will visit. <br/>
When the book is full our daughter will mail it to us and we will <br/>
enjoy the stamps from your coast. I have posted the box to the mail <br/>
letterboxing list and will include a copy of the directions here.<br/>
<br/>
Kenmore Park is a home for the Washington State flower, the <br/>
Rhododendron. This is a companion box to our Nipmuck Laurel <br/>
Sanctuary (Connecticut State flower box for Mountain Laurel) in <br/>
Union, Connecticut. Our daughter lives near Kenmore Park and while <br/>
we were visiting her, we just had to plant a letterbox. Being from <br/>
Connecticut, we will be thrilled to collect Pacific Northwest <br/>
letterboxers' stamps. When the book is full, our daughter will mail <br/>
it to us.<br/>
<br/>

are not local to the area, there may be easier ways to get here! <br/>
<br/>
The first rhododendron to be classified and named was R. hirsutum. <br/>
It was discovered by the 16th century Flemish botanist, Charles <br/>
l'Ecluse, who later became called Clusius. When it was introduced to <br/>
Britain in 1656 from the European Alps, R. hirsutum (the Alpine <br/>
Rose) was the first species of rhododendron in cultivation. <br/>
Exploration in America came as a result of a partnership between <br/>
English Quaker Peter Collinson and botanist/farmer John Bartram of <br/>
Pennsylvania. This led to the importation to England of the American <br/>
native species.<br/>
R occidentale, the Pacific or Western Azalea, is a tall deciduous <br/>
azalea found in the Pacific Coast states. The flower color is <br/>
usually white or pale pink with a strong yellow flare, but my be <br/>
red, yellow or orange-pink and occasionally the flare is maroon. The <br/>
foliage turns red and copper shades in the fall. It is among the <br/>
showiest of all species with bright colors on impressive flowers. <br/>
However it is difficult to propagate and grow. It is considered <br/>
impossible to grow on the East Coast.<br/>
In 1892, before they had the right to vote, Washington women <br/>
selected the coast rhododendron as the state flower. They wanted an <br/>
official flower to enter in a floral exhibit at the 1893 World's <br/>
Fair in Chicago. Six flowers were considered, but the final decision <br/>
was narrowed to clover and the "rhodie," and voting booths were set <br/>
up for ladies throughout the state. When the ballots were counted, <br/>
the rhododendron had been chosen as the Washington state flower.<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Please bring your own Ink pad or watercolor markers and a compass.<br/>
<br/>
Start in the  corner of the parking lot nearest the swings. Follow <br/>
the path to the Children's swing and slide area. <br/>
Continue on the path, but stop before you reach the covered picnic <br/>
area. Look right for an old path at 310 degrees. This old path is <br/>
through the Rhododendron. Take this old paved path and follow to the <br/>
end of the paved path.<br/>
At the end of the path, standing by the rock look to 350 degrees and <br/>
you will see a grey shed marked "Danger High Voltage" Walk to the <br/>
shed.<br/>
Stand on the green square water control plate and look to 20 <br/>
degrees. You should see a stump. Walk approximately 90 steps (each <br/>
foot fall counts) to the stump. <br/>
