                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went out yesterday for a gorgeous hike in Seward Park. Brought my <br>
letterboxing stuff with me and went a-lookin' for Now & Then. What an <br>
awesome series - I've never really walked throughout the park before. <br>
Such gorgeous trees. Both boxes were happy and dry. "Now" even had a <br>
suspicious little salamander on it, wondering WHAT we were doing <br>
there - it had been over 2 months since a visitor had been by.<br>
<br>
I'm SO glad I brought markers with me. I'm getting into using <br>
markers, especially after my stamping friend told me about the <br>
breathing on the stamp thing. I was always hurrying to try and color <br>
it in before all the ink dried and she (so wise!) recommended <br>
breathing on it to moisten it before stamping in! sure enough! soo <br>
cool! makes so much sense!<br>
<br>
I forgot to report that on October 3rd the "Frog Rock" box was all <br>
happy. Again a great stamp for markers. Such a cute stamp.<br>
<br>
The Ballard Locks box placed by Wives and Daughters was a challenging <br>
one to get to with all of the tourists running around on a sunny <br>
Saturday (sept 27). Fortunately, there was a guy who had his whole <br>
bottle-top collection on display near us and was taking photos of <br>
them with the different things so no one really wanted to look in our <br>
direction. :)<br>
<br>
We also logged in at "After the Story's End" by Team Garlic. Nory and <br>
I have been looking at that one for months! Maybe ever since we first <br>
learned about letterboxing. Go do it! Such fun!<br>
<br>
We tried to go after another one of the Tracy Outlaw series but he <br>
got away again. WAY too many people and dogs at Golden Gardens to get <br>
near that one. We'll have to try again when the weather's not so nice!<br>
<br>
Woohoo! Can't wait for a winter full of letterboxing distractions!<br>

Maybe if you didnt look in the trees all the time for your feathered <br>
friends you might see the amphibous folk down in the muck.<br>

Doesnt someone on the main yahoo board have a "L" count to keep <br>
track of lizards, salamanders, and such when letterboxing?<br>
