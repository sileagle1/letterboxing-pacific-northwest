<br/>
Today a good friend of mine set off with an amazing group of folks <br/>
who are going to pedal their bikes across the US-Seattle to <br/>
Washington DC! She decided to do this for her 57th birthday, to <br/>
celebrate quitting smoking, and to rally support for those suffering <br/>
from smoking-induced lung disease (like my father).<br/>
<br/>
We waved her on this morning as she passed through Bellevue, and were <br/>
so moved by the spirit of these people that we carved a stamp right <br/>
there and then and hid it.<br/>
<br/>

They're up on the LbNA site: http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?<br/>
boxnum=8924&amp;boxname=Big_Ride. I was so pumped after seeing her ride <br/>
by that I ran home and posted them right away!<br/>
<br/>
If you're up our way, it's a nice diversion.<br/>
