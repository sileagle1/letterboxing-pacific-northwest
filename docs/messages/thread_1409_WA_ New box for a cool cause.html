<br>
Today a good friend of mine set off with an amazing group of folks <br>
who are going to pedal their bikes across the US-Seattle to <br>
Washington DC! She decided to do this for her 57th birthday, to <br>
celebrate quitting smoking, and to rally support for those suffering <br>
from smoking-induced lung disease (like my father).<br>
<br>
We waved her on this morning as she passed through Bellevue, and were <br>
so moved by the spirit of these people that we carved a stamp right <br>
there and then and hid it.<br>
<br>
Follow the progress of the Big Ride at www.bigride.org!<br>
<br>
There, I'll get off my soapbox now...<br>

For every visit to this letterbox between now and August 14 (the end <br>

<br>
They're up on the LbNA site: http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?<br>
boxnum=8924&boxname=Big_Ride. I was so pumped after seeing her ride <br>
by that I ran home and posted them right away!<br>
<br>
If you're up our way, it's a nice diversion.<br>

Thanks!<br>
