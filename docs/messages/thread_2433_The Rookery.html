photos of where I was looking.  I'm posting to say that this trip<br/>
right now is so worth it box or not!  The herons nesting in those<br/>
trees is really quite a sight.  If you go, drive around the area - we<br/>
also saw huge flocks of Canada Geese in the fields, and although it<br/>
sounds like they are considered pests by many farmers, they sure were<br/>
awesome to look at en masse.  Lots of other wildlife to see as well,<br/>
hawks, ducks, etc.  A great time of year to go looking for this<br/>
particular box.  <br/>
