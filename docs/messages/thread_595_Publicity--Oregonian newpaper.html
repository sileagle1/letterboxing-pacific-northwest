<br/>
The result of Heather and my visit with a local reporter is in today's <br/>
Clackamas County Weekly section of The Oregonian.  Thanks to all of you who replied <br/>
a few weeks back when I asked whether we should talk with this reporter or <br/>
not.  Consensus was that it was best the article include the input of actual <br/>
LBers.  <br/>
<br/>
The good news for those who are unhappy with media publicity about our hidden <br/>
hobby is that this section of the Oregonian is only included in the Clackamas <br/>
County distribution area.  (The masses of Multnomah and elsewhere are still <br/>
unaware...).  The reporter did a fine job, mostly focusing on the <br/>
family/kid-friendly aspects of LBing (the article is in the "Education and Family" section <br/>
of the newspaper).  Heather and I repeatedly stressed the low-impact to the <br/>
environment message that so many of you asked us to relay.  It was boiled down <br/>
to this paragraph: "Lichen and Yost said letterboxers have one rule that they <br/>
insist everyone follow--whenever visiting a letterbox or placing a letterbox, <br/>
make sure the area is left the same way it was before a box was placed there."  <br/>
Well, I might have liked more empathsis, but I was glad to see it in there.  <br/>
<br/>
In fact, the only thing I really have to complain about is that the photo <br/>
that accompanies the article includes all the Yosts--but not my dear little Wild <br/>
Child!  (Oh well, I'll take comfort in the fact that she received extra <br/>
attention in the Stamp Camp photos Funhog kindly posted.)<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few quotes pulled from the article:<br/>
"Letterboxing is like going on a regular hike, but you follow clues and <br/>
directions to find a rubber stamp," Megan said.  "I like doing it because you have <br/>
to act secretive whenever you find the letterbox."<br/>
<br/>
"I like reading the clues and figuring them out," Hallie said.  "Some clues <br/>
are really hard and some aren't."<br/>
"What's really fun is when the parents are stumped and the kids find it," <br/>
Lichen said.<br/>
<br/>
"Part of the allure of letterboxing has been its secrecy," Lichen said.  "Not <br/>
many people in the Northwest know about it, which adds to the furtive fun and <br/>
the sense of being part of a secret society."<br/>
<br/>
Finding the box is the "icing on the cake"...The real treat is the experience <br/>
of being outside together "in some lovely places, stretching your legs and <br/>
your mind."<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to read the article but is outside of the Clackamas County <br/>
distribution area, give me a shout and I'll see what I can do about either <br/>
including it in an email or snail-mailing you a copy.<br/>
