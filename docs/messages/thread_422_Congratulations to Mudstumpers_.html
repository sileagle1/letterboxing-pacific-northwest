                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you very much , we had a beautiful ceremony and a fabulous honeymoon at Wallowa Lake and the Hells Canyon area.  We had intended to place several boxes and sort of, not exactly forgot, but had other things to do that interfered with letterboxing.  We plan to return to the area and plant some boxes in some very special and beautiful places we discovered.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We did do some boxing on the way east.  We found  Let 'er Buck,  hot and dry and very lonely.  Beautiful job Funhog!<br/>
<br/>
Road Trip at Deadman's Pass is alive and well.  We hope we didn't arouse the curiosity of some truckers working on their rig.<br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
<br/>
Halfway to the 45th Parallel.  Out in the middle of nowhere!  What were you and Amanda doing out there!  We technically claim 1st to log in since Amanda logged in the day you placed it Ryan.  Cute book there Ryan!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you one and all for the great stamps and diverersions along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Our boxes will be  posted soon.<br/>
