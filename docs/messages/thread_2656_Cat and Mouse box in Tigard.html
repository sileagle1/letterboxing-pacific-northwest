It was great to see lots of you at the gathering. Kudos to Maiden and  <br>
all who helped!!<br>
I'm hoping someone can help me out a bit.<br>
I checked on this box today and it had no log books and an extra stamp.<br>
I'm thinking maybe it is a HH but someone took that logbook too? It  <br>
looks like maybe Santa in an airplane and is carved on 3/4"  <br>
MasterCarve I think. If anyone knows who it belongs to or what it's  <br>
called that would help. 3CHIX signed in on paper last so I'd like to  <br>
check to see if they left the stamp or if it was already there so if  <br>
you know how to reach them please pass it to me.<br>
Thanks!<br>
