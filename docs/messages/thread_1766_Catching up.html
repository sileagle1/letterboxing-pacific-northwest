It's SloMo here and guess it's time to check in.  Because of poor health we<br/>
haven't been doing much Lbing or going to the events.   Der Mad Stamper -<br/>
Thank you for the cipher clue boxes.  They have been a bright spot in this<br/>
cold, dark season.  We caught the Turtle Soup LB and it is my favorite stamp<br/>
in the log book! So cool Pandora!  Of course, being a turtle myself, and it<br/>
being Halloween that day, I was glad to make it out in one piece.  ;-) <br/>
<br/>
To Erfellie - I don't know which direction your traveling from but Vancouver<br/>
area has a number of boxes and most (well all, really) are without the big<br/>
city feel.  I'm a country bumpkin, myself, so I understand where you're<br/>
coming from.  Anyplace with street parking and meters is too much hassle for<br/>
me.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help with advice? - <br/>
We are planning a trip up the gorge (I-84) to the Tri-cities right after<br/>
T-day and would like to catch a box or two.  Found Ryan's African Safari<br/>
series - would like to get what we can of those (love African wildlife) but<br/>
probably won't be able to get to them.   There's only one box listed in the<br/>
Tri-cities (Corp of Discovery Sacajawea)   We tried to find it last July but<br/>
it was not there and the site was disturbed.  I'm still waiting to hear from<br/>
the placer on that one.   <br/>
........ Anyway....  are there other websites with clues besides LbNA and<br/>
Ryan's site?   Ideally there would be boxes in Richland, Pasco, or<br/>
Kennewick... or near there.  We'd like to place a box too (Wood Splinters<br/>
grew up there).  Maybe hiding Lbs in the desert is silly.  *laugh* <br/>
<br/>
Hope you're all are having fun!<br/>

<br/>
We traveled through the Gorge in October, Spokane to Portland, to watch EWU play at Portland State.  We found the same thing--not many letterboxes in the desert!  We did find Sacajawea in the Tri Cities, it has a beautiful logbook and cool stamp.  Our other finds were Multnomah Falls (Der Mad Stamper), Hidden Palms, Silver Eagle's Lewis &amp; Clark Series:  Lewis &amp; Clark in Oregon, and Lower Latourell Falls (actually off I84, but well worth the detour.  Another idea is to travel on the Washington side.  I know there are boxes at the Maryhill Museum, that Stonehenge-like memorial, and several around Rooster Rock.  I sure hope you plant something else in the Tri-Cities, I'd like to see some of the interesting sites there.<br/>
