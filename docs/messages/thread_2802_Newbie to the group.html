My family & I just discovered letterboxing last week.  Good timing too, <br>
I am out of school for the summer and needed something active to do <br>
with my 2 kids!  We live in Everett, WA and have found 5 boxes so far <br>
and are hooked.  We are working on making our own boxes to plant next <br>
week.<br>
<br>
Any tips or words of wisdom would be great!<br>
<br>
What is your favorite box/series in the Seattle/Everett area?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Welcome to the wacky world of letterboxing! My only words of "wisdom"<br>
are to take your time with your plants. I was so enthusiastic when I<br>
first discovered letterboxing that I planted lots of boxes right away.<br>
Over time my carving skills have improved greatly and I wish that I<br>
had fewer of my early stamps out there. Also, the more boxes you find,<br>
the better you will become at hiding well and writing interesting clues. <br>
<br>
Enjoy your newfound hobby, Funhog<br>

Not sure how much wisdom this is but . . .<br>
- My favorite placements are placed somewhere special to me or the theme has special meaning. <br>
- Place in locations that you think people would enjoy being. . .  maybe spending some time.  <br>
- On the other hand drive-by boxes are fun for finders who are passing through the area or locals that just don't have much time on a given day. <br>
- We have a skunk stamp for use when we come home without a box.  This helps ease the disappointment. And you have a stamp image to log the "attempt" by if you wish to record it.  <br>
- Start with a good quality log book.  The stamps, boxes and outings recorded there can become a keepsake of wonderful memories.   <br>
- Respect the placers perogative - how they write clues, where they place, the carving, etc.  Each box is a gift.  <br>
<br>
I think it's great that you're already placing boxes!   When you place your own you realize how much can go into each box.     Kudos to you!<br>

Thanks for all the advice. <br>
I love your skunk stamp idea for attempts!<br>
<br>
We placed our first box on Monday.  You are right, I have a new <br>
appreciation for how much work goes into placing a box.  We were at <br>
the beach for a long time while I was trying to find a spot and write <br>
clues.  The kids didn't mind the extra playtime though!  Here is the <br>
link to our first box if you want to take a look: <br>

Happy 4th of July!<br>
