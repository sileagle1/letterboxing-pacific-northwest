                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp is this weekend and I can <br/>
hardly wait! This is going to be an event that you will not want to <br/>
miss. <br/>
There will be some great workshops and activities and a few surprises <br/>
as well. Here are a few reminders for the event:<br/>
For everyone who will be camping, please check in at campsite #14 <br/>
before 6:30 pm on Friday so you can participate in the Meet and <br/>
Greet. If you are in need of firewood, there is a kind, little old <br/>
man who lives a block from the park and sells firewood for $3.00 a <br/>
bundle. <br/>
If you are coming up for the day on Saturday, please check in at <br/>
campsite #14 before 9:30 am to be there in time for the first <br/>
workshop at 10:00 am. Be sure to bring your own food for the day <br/>
since this is not a potluck event. There is a $5.00 day use fee to <br/>
enter the park. Park in the parking lot to your right after the <br/>
ranger station and walk up to campsite #14. It is not that far. <br/>
Tickets for some awesome letterboxing raffle items are $1.00 each or <br/>
6 for $5.00 and letterbox starter kits with a carving tool are <br/>
available for purchase for $5.00 each. Please no checks! If you have <br/>
your own carving tools, please bring them for the stamp carving <br/>
workshop. Bring a hitch hiker if you would like to participate in the <br/>
Hitch Hiker Hostel hidden in the park. <br/>
PLEASE DO NOT BRING EXTRA LETTERBOXES AND HITCH HIKERS TO LEAVE ON <br/>
THE TABLES.<br/>
Please RSVP to tinarie at msn dot com so that we can make sure we <br/>
have enough supplies for everyone.<br/>
Whether you are coming from the north or the south on the I-5 <br/>
freeway, exit at 179th Ave./exit 9. There will be red signs with red, <br/>
green and blue balloons that will direct you to the park from the I-5 <br/>
freeway so please watch for them and we will you see at the Passport <br/>
to Letterboxing Stamp Camp at Battle Ground Lake in Battle Ground, WA.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW!!! What a great day it was at the Stamp Camp yesterday.  We literally<br/>
boxed until we dropped. I got home at 10:30 and put my sore, aching feet up<br/>
right away.   It was great to see old friends from afar and near and meet<br/>
all of the people that we have never seen before.  You are defiantly a great<br/>
crowd to hang out with.  The stamps and conversations were amazing.  The<br/>
classes were so informative I am sure we all learned a lot.  It was great to<br/>
finally meet the infamous Der Mad Stamper; you truly are a delight to<br/>
converse with.  We are glad that you are back in action.  I look forward in<br/>
the future to meeting all of your again and do some boxing, meeting on the<br/>
trails, exchanging stories, ect.  We really had a great time and my little<br/>
one, Heartsey, totally enjoyed the kid's activities.  That was a definite<br/>
plus.  You letterboxers are truly a rare breed of wonderful people.  Thanks<br/>
again, Willow, Daisy and Heartsey.  <br/>

  I couldn't have said it better than you have. Thank you all that <br/>
attended the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp. It was so nice to <br/>
meet the new letterboxers in this area and to see some old familiar <br/>
faces and hang out. Despite the brief(and thank goodness it was <br/>
brief) incident of a missing child on the trails, we all pulled <br/>
together as a community and everything turned out wonderfully.        <br/>
KeliKana, I hope you have recovered and your family is safe and sound <br/>
once again. Thank you Pandora, Iron Bear, Maiden and Bookworm for all <br/>
your hard work to make this event something that will never be <br/>
forgotten by me or any of the many letterboxers that attended. I look <br/>
foward to seeing you all again on the trails and finding some of your <br/>
letterboxes now that you all know how to carve a stamp and bind a <br/>
logbook. <br/>
  Ryan, it is too bad that you were unable to make it to the event. <br/>
There sure were a lot of green things being flung about and toasted <br/>
over an open campfire that I know you would have liked to be a part <br/>
of. Oh well, you were there in spirit. (grin)<br/>
  Der Mad Stamper, what can I say. It was an honor to meet you and <br/>
have the chance to hang out and laugh with you. Cat's Meow is still <br/>
talking about how she got a hug from the infamous Der Mad Stamper!<br/>
  And Charlie, you know I always love to see you again. I thought you <br/>
looked very distinguished in your new "colorful" hat.<br/>

<br/>
Being so new to letterboxing and having the awesome<br/>
privlege of attending a stamp camp so "new" into this<br/>
hobby is beyond words available to express.  This was<br/>
MY TREAT for the summer.  After driving 1,300 miles in<br/>
the past three weeks to take and drop of kids to camp<br/>
- STAMP CAMP was MY day! HeHeHe<br/>
<br/>
I said once yesterday how I wished I could have gone<br/>
to this FIRST and then started LBing because I now<br/>
know what I like, what I should have, and what I want<br/>
to do in the future in regards to letterboxes I find<br/>
and those I plant.<br/>
<br/>
My poor body ached the entire night after hiking,<br/>
rehiking, hiking again, giving up, and hiking some<br/>
more out of sure greed for the "special" stamp given<br/>
only to those who could acquire 10 or more event<br/>
stamps.  Oh I felt it last night and had to take a<br/>
super snooze today to recover! Smile.<br/>
<br/>
A few KUDO's are in order after yesterday's<br/>
festivities:<br/>
<br/>
CampFireLady - you have the peace of God in you!  Your<br/>
kindness, gentleness and ability to work with children<br/>
left me in awe!  Makes me want to leave the Girl<br/>
Scouts and join in the Camp Fire! Smile!<br/>
<br/>
Maiden - after many emails back and forth I never got<br/>
to sit down and chat with you.  However, I have<br/>
knowledge on how to book bind now and I can do it, I'm<br/>
pleased to say....and my journals shall never look the<br/>
same again!<br/>
<br/>
Dvn2Kr - gosh I hope I have your trail name right -<br/>
THANKS for the "extra" Rhodie. Giggle.  <br/>
<br/>
Old Vet - from one carver to another....isn't that<br/>
bowl sitting in front of us for SNACKS???!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Charlie TrailDuster - Um, your advice about hiking has<br/>
STUCK with me!  From this point on I vow to slow down<br/>
and enjoy the hike! Smile!<br/>
<br/>
Pupp - My kids were so glad to have met you! <br/>
Blessings to you for planting boxes that are not only<br/>
great finds but keep the kids excited about LBing. <br/>
Thanks for being a part of this hobby!<br/>
<br/>
Jenn - I never caught back up with you for those<br/>
personal travellers (Pupp neither).  ARGH!  Missed out<br/>
and bummin' to boot! Still happy to have met ya!<br/>
<br/>
Bookworm - Didn't get a ton of time to chat with you<br/>
but your name is "famous" in our house which is also<br/>
full of bookworms!!!!<br/>
<br/>
TEAM RAVENHAUS - I owe ya'll!  Without your mighty<br/>
assistance, the 70 degree question would have been<br/>
left hanging in the woods!  Boxing with ya'll brought<br/>
new meaning to "reading" the clues! AND was a firm<br/>
reminder of the importance of "leaving it better than<br/>
you found it".  HOORAY! SNOOPY HAS BEEN FOUND!<br/>
<br/>
to IRON BEAR and PANDORA - you two are amazing people.<br/>
 Iron Bear, you never said one negative word<br/>
yesterday!  Thank You! I just can't really explain the<br/>
effect you had on me.  I have great respect for you,<br/>
your knowledge, and willingness to share it! Pandora,<br/>
thank you for your generosity, your forthrightness<br/>
(which I appreciate), your honest, and your<br/>
willingness to share your knowlege with the group!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I cannot forget DER MAD STAMPER!  After all<br/>
the craziness on the list, I thought for sure I was in<br/>
for a public reprimand from the man himself yesterday!<br/>
SMILE!  Much to my surprise, I met and talked with one<br/>
of the kindest people I've met in my life.  WOW!  I<br/>
never "rush" to meet a famous person because "stars"<br/>
just don't have an affect on me...however, when I meet<br/>
a GENUINE person - I am touched and am quickly<br/>
reminded why I enjoy people and being with people so<br/>
much!  It was a honor sir to not only meet you but to<br/>
share my backwards personal traveller with you!<br/>
HeHeHe!!!! GO VOLS!<br/>
<br/>
What an amazing experience.  One I won't soon forget. <br/>
My children left with a passion for the hobby, a fire<br/>
to "carve" and plant their own series.  For me, I came<br/>
away with so much knowledge that I feel blessed to<br/>
have been a part of not only such a wonderful event<br/>
but of an exceptional group of people!<br/>
<br/>
GOD'S BEST to all of you!<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I'm sad I missed that part.  That sounded like it would have <br/>
been a lot of fun.  =)  Nope, instead I was out on the trails hiking <br/>
my little legs off for the Hike-A-Thon trying to catch up to at least <br/>
100 miles before the end of the month.  (Which was the minimum amount <br/>
I was planning to do--until my untimely arthritis got in the way.)<br/>
<br/>
Made it up to 98.5 miles this afternoon!  Almost there!  Should break <br/>
100 miles tomorrow.  =)<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that would love to contribute to a good cause, it's <br/>
not too late!  *wink*  http://www.atlasquest.com/hikeathon/  Still <br/>
two more days left!<br/>
<br/>
And I'm working up more of my infamous adventures from the trail <br/>
which I figure will be out on the 31st.  =)  It's got everything: <br/>
Dead bodies, crashing trees, rain (oh, miserable rain....), and--<br/>
don't let this get out too far, but I even slept with Funhog.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Yep, lots of drama and action in this next adventure.  =)<br/>

Bear, Maiden and Bookworm for the Passport to Letterboxing Event! It <br/>
was tremendous fun, and we all had a wonderful time. The organisation <br/>
was awesome, everything was absolutely perfect, and the many event <br/>
stamps were wonderful! Pandora's carving class was great, and I learned <br/>
a lot of new things I can't wait to try out. My son had a wonderful <br/>
time with CampFire Lady's Junior Ranger program. It was so much fun to <br/>
meet and talk with and box with everyone! And thank you to Team Nashoba <br/>
for introducing us to the game of horseballs! It was a special honor to <br/>
meet Der Mad Stamper. It's a beautiful park, and I encourage anyone who <br/>
hasn't been there to find the all the boxes there - the stamps are <br/>
gorgeous, but the boxes are very well hidden! A great big thank you to <br/>
everyone who made this event possible - and can we do it again next <br/>
year, please?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Horseballs is a game thought of and designed by my "adopted" father in<br/>
Washington. He made my family a set so we could have as much fun as they<br/>
did. We brought it to camp with us and then Pupp came carved us a stamp to<br/>
go with it. SOOOOO.. anyone that plays with us gets the stamp. (Good<br/>
sportsmanship is a MUST).<br/>
<br/>
It's actually a ton of fun. The goals are made up of PVC pipe. It has 3<br/>
horizontal bars, stacked on top of each other. You stand at the opposite end<br/>
with the "horse balls". (They are two golf balls with a 18 inch piece of<br/>
rope attached to them) You throw the horseballs any way you like but the<br/>
goal is to wrap them around one of the horizontal bars. Each one has a<br/>
different point value. That's all there is to it. Lots of fun for adults,<br/>
kids, and labradors.<br/>

  We gotta know how to play Horseballs!!!!<br/>
<br/>
  We are sorry we didn't make it to Stamp Camp. It sounds like it was a<br/>
wonderful experiance.  We aren't the most social people on the planet, which<br/>
is our main reason why we love backpacking and hiking.<br/>

I learned a lot and really appreciated the first-hand help.  I've <br/>
decided on SchoolMarm as my id and have a pencil drawing of my name <br/>
stamp.  Will be going shopping for Mastercarve or some other medium <br/>
tomorrow.  Can I get this at Craft Warehouse or Michaels???<br/>
Again, big thanks for the hard work and time that everyone put out!<br/>
