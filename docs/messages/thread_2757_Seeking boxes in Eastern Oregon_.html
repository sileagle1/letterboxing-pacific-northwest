I just wanted to provide a couple of updates on some of my boxes in<br/>
Eastern Oregon that are still awaiting their first finders!  Two are<br/>
in the Heppner area and the third is right outside the small town of<br/>
Condon.<br/>
<br/>
Molinos - I finally added clues to this box.  <br/>
Wapiti - No finders on this yet.  The roads to this area should be<br/>
clear  now.<br/>
Bull Pairie - I replaced this stamp with a much better one late last<br/>
year.  This box is very close (a few minutes drive) from the Wapiti<br/>
box.  Bring your fishing pole!<br/>
<br/>
Clues for all three are in the usual places.  Please update me on the<br/>
health of these boxes if you are able to uncover them.<br/>
