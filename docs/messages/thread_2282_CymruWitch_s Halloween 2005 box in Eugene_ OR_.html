<br>
I would like to recommend a GREAT box- CymruWitch's Halloween 2005 box.<br>
<br>
It is in Eugene, and only around for a limited time. It is a cemetary<br>
that is beautiful and unique. The logbook is maybe the most beautiful<br>
I have ever seen, and the hand-carved stamp is cute and creative.<br>
<br>
Here is a link to the clues:<br>

<br>
It fits perfecty for the season. Definatly stop by if you have the<br>
chance. It didn't take too long, and it was well worth it. Happy<br>
Halloween!<br>

stamps and very crafty logbooks.  You should definitely seek out her <br>
boxes if you are ever in Eugene.<br>
