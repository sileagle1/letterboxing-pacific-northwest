looking for ideas as to potential placement sites. IT has a <br/>
movie/hollywood theme to it. <br/>
I am taking any and all suggestions as to an appropriate potential <br/>
site. I have one in mind but am not quite sure since we will have to <br/>
get permissions granted for it's placement. <br/>
So..until we find someplace that "feels" like the right spot for it <br/>
I'll be open to suggestions! I had played with the idea of placing it <br/>
near the house used to film "The Hand that Rocked the Cradle" but its <br/>
a residential neighborhood and has no real good spot for it. <br/>
<br/>
I would prefer Pierce Co. sites as these are easier for me to <br/>
maintain as opposed to a site in Seattle.<br/>

It's too bad you want it in Pierce County, because otherwise I'd have <br/>
to suggest the Hollywood District in Portland.  =)  Oh, so perfect....<br/>
