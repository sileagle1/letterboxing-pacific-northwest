Ah, Little Mt. Si! Letterbox<br>
Planted on July 25, 2004 by Keegan the Airedale Terrier, Piper, Toast Boy<br>
and Loud Eyes.<br>
Day Hikers Only<br>
No Bicycles or Horses<br>
This is a 5-mile roundtrip hike.<br>
1,200 feet gained in elevation.<br>
The top of Little Mt. Si (pronounced sigh) is 1,576 feet above sea level.<br>
The trail has some steep sections with roots and rocks that require hand<br>
holds. Hiking time roundtrip is approximately 3 to 4 hours. Be sure to take<br>
the 10 essentials plus water and/or your favorite beverage. A camera and<br>
binoculars will come in handy. Colored markers will make the rubber stamped<br>
image cooler!<br>
<br>
Driving directions:<br>
<br>
Drive I-90 to the town of North Bend and take exit 31 into town. Turn right<br>
heading east on the main drag of North Bend Way. Just east of town turn<br>
left, heading north on Mount Si Road (432nd SE). Cross the bridge over the<br>
Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River. Bear right just past the bridge and<br>
drive a 1/4 mile more to the new parking lot on the left. The lot is<br>
designed to hold 50 cars and includes a new outhouse. If the lot is full,<br>
you can park back at the old lot next to the bridge and walk to the<br>
trailhead.<br>
<br>
This is the first letterbox planted in an eventual series along the trail<br>
to the summit of Little Mt. Si. Clues will be added to this webpage, once<br>
other letterboxes are in place. Please stay tuned!<br>
<br>
>From the parking lot, follow the signs to the top of Little Mt. Si. The<br>
>trail snakes through a beautiful forest and past rock faces used by rock<br>
>climbers.<br>
<br>
Once on top, take in the nearly 180 degree view of the Snoqualmie River<br>
Valley, Snoqualmie Pass, McClellan Butte, Mailbox Peak, Rattle Snake Ledge,<br>
North Bend, and of course Mt. Si.<br>
<br>
Clues:<br>
<br>
Embedded in the rock at the top of Little Si are two metal, round National<br>
Geodetic Survey Reference Markers. The northern most marker is at the<br>
highest point of Little Si. Search for the second marker approximately 20<br>
paces towards the south. Stand on top of the southern lower marker and take<br>
a compass bearing of 250 degrees magnetic. Scramble down hill in this<br>
direction for approximately 20 to 25 paces. Look for a blown down tree with<br>
a root ball. Inside the protected root ball is a rock cairn that contains<br>
the Ah, Little Mt. Si! Letterbox.<br>
<br>

This is my seventh planted letterbox. Please email me with any questions or<br>
