                    <div class="plaintext-content">Can it be called a new box if it was out for less than 24 hours and <br/>
it was stolen? We put this box out in what we thought was the perfect <br/>
spot (if you go there and get to the post look behind you at the knot <br/>
in the tree) and we must have been spotted. It was placed Sat evening <br/>
and we checked on it Sunday morning. When we checked on it Sun. <br/>
evening (newbies do that sorta thing, seperation anxiety) it was <br/>
gone! Our first box and it was already gone. That doesn't make you <br/>
too confident in your judgement. The place seemed deserted when we <br/>
checked on it the first time. When discovered it missing there was <br/>
one family, and only one, milling around the park. As we were leaving <br/>
rather stunned and angry my wife noticed their teenage daughter <br/>
putting our letterbox in the back of their truck. Pretty good (I say <br/>
lucky) spotting at 50 yards. I shout "Is that our letterbox?" She <br/>
seemed pretty amiable and we do believe that it was her intention to <br/>
return it but that she was to shy, but maybe the "DO NOT REMOVE, THIS <br/>
IS A LETTERBOX" should have been a clue that we intended it to be <br/>
left there. But then they didn't seem the literate sort either. Hope <br/>
you can find it. Hope somebody actually looks for it. I hope we are <br/>
not a bunch of losers and you guys laugh us off the net. Going back <br/>
to that anxiety thing again.  Jerry of The 4 B's<br/>
