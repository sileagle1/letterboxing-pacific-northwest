We had a wonderful stay there, and while we were there, we planted a <br/>
2nd annual Eagle Crest LB......clues to follow.  Didn't have time to <br/>
grab any other boxes while in Central Oregon.........guess we spent <br/>
too much time laying by the pool! We are heading back this next <br/>
Saturday though and hope to do some boxing.  It is hubby's and my <br/>
11th anniversary on Saturday, and we  spent it boxing last year, so <br/>
we might as well make it tradition!!!! <br/>
<br/>
Be sure to check out clues for our new box, and visit the old one, <br/>
it is a beautiful place!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun,<br/>
Carie<br/>
