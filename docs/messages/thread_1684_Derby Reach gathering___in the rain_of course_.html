I had to miss it too...  didn't even make it out of bed until 11ish. First <br/>
time in a kzillion years I've slept that late.  Have been laid low by some <br/>
mean bug, and spent most of the weekend on the couch -much to the delight <br/>
of the giant cat.<br/>
<br/>
Really wanted to meet up with y'all, especially Amanda B - we've been <br/>
exchanging carvings for years now.  Hope you had a wonderful gathering, <br/>
even it was a bit damp, and look forward to hearing all about it.<br/>
<br/>
eepy <br/>
