the clues this morning, and I must say was very proud of myself that <br>
I deciphered them all.  We had never been to NOble Woods so we were <br>
surprised how close it was and again how beautiful of a walk it <br>
was!!!!  We nabbed all 5 of them.  Very busy park today but we kept <br>
discreet.  Had to hide a few of the boxes a bit better than they <br>
were, but still the same exact spot!!!!!  We almost got eaten alive <br>
by mosquitos but found if we kept moving we were fine!!!! We were <br>
the third and sometime forth to find these boxes!!!!  Thanks for a <br>
great afternoon!!!!<br>
