the clues this morning, and I must say was very proud of myself that <br/>
I deciphered them all.  We had never been to NOble Woods so we were <br/>
surprised how close it was and again how beautiful of a walk it <br/>
was!!!!  We nabbed all 5 of them.  Very busy park today but we kept <br/>
discreet.  Had to hide a few of the boxes a bit better than they <br/>
were, but still the same exact spot!!!!!  We almost got eaten alive <br/>
by mosquitos but found if we kept moving we were fine!!!! We were <br/>
the third and sometime forth to find these boxes!!!!  Thanks for a <br/>
great afternoon!!!!<br/>

&gt; Beth and I returned from a little park down the street where we <br/>
&gt; grabbed 5 of 5 of the Noble Woods Letterboxes!  Looks like we were <br/>
&gt; the first for at least 3 of the 5.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was the same park where we placed our first boxes, <br/>
&gt; the "Terrestrial Gastropod Series", almost 2 years ago.  That <br/>
series <br/>
&gt; is now defunct, a victim of the high water floods along Rock <br/>
Creek, <br/>
&gt; which swept through later that year. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not familiar with the folks who placed these boxes, but I will <br/>
&gt; say the location of #1 and maybe #2 are in the area that "usually" <br/>
&gt; goes under water in the winter months.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the fun!<br/>
