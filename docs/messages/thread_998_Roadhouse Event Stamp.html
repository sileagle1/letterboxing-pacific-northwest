Kuddos to Brett for his outstanding event stamp(s), complete<br/>

<br/>
I think it would be nice to submit a picture of the event<br/>
stamp image into the Photos section of this site, since<br/>
the stamp really won't be used for a box.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone agree?<br/>

I agree! The stamp is beautiful! If Brett would like to pass the <br/>
stamp around I could add it to the box of traveling event stamps that <br/>
I brought with me to the gathering. The box would be shipped out to <br/>
the next gathering as soon as one is posted. What do you think Brett? <br/>

stamp into a traveling stamp. (????)  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, it could be shared with others across the country<br/>
in this manner, but then it could also be shared if it<br/>
were in electronic format.  Why would someone who wasn't<br/>
at the gathering want to use the stamp anyway????<br/>
<br/>
Thus, I agree with Amanda and the gang who thinks it <br/>
should be retired, as it already served it's original <br/>
purpose.  Of course, that is only my humble opinion.<br/>
<br/>
The final decision here, of course, is up to Brett.  :o)<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  We could suggest he turn it into a letterbox, but he'd<br/>
have to put it in a box the size of a shoebox.  YeeGad Zooks!<br/>
What would the park rangers think then???  Har!<br/>
