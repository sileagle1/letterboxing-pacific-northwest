I'm ready to get some serious stamps in my log book.<br/>
Could someone please confirm whether the following<br/>
letterboxes are active or not:<br/>
<br/>
1. The Waterfalls Letterbox Series<br/>
 (I understand PonyTail Falls and Wahkeena Falls are<br/>
both missing - will someone replace them or are they<br/>
forever gone?)<br/>
<br/>
2.  The Spirit of Dartmoor <br/>
   (If I can even figure out the clue to this one)<br/>
<br/>
3.  The Lost Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
4.  Japanese Gardens<br/>
<br/>
5.  Powell Butte<br/>
<br/>
6.  Marquam Trail<br/>
<br/>
7.  Elk Rock Island<br/>
<br/>
8.  Warrior Rock<br/>
<br/>
I've got to say - DMS was a master at clue writing!!! <br/>
Not to mention a whiz with an x-acto and white rubber<br/>
erasers which are exactly the same tools I've been<br/>
using for my stamps - ah, but not with the same<br/>
miraculous results!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
All of the waterfall boxes are alive and well, so far as I know.  The <br/>
Horsetail Falls box I've heard is a 'challenge' because the 'finger' <br/>
in the clue is no longer there, so there's a lot more trial and error <br/>
involved to find it than in years past.<br/>
<br/>
I replanted the Ponytail and Wahkeena Falls boxes a couple of years <br/>
ago, but due to a change in topography, the clues had to change.  The <br/>
new clues are at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/OR/ColumbiaRiverFalls/<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2.  The Spirit of Dartmoor <br/>
<br/>
You know, I thought this box could NEVER go missing, but for some <br/>
reason I have this nagging feeling in my head that the stamp is <br/>
missing or something.  Did someone say that once upon a time?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3.  The Lost Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
I think this one has been found fairly recently.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 6.  Marquam Trail<br/>
<br/>
The one on Council Crest is missing.  Not sure about the other one.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 8.  Warrior Rock<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Rock is definitely missing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 4.  Japanese Gardens<br/>
&gt; 5.  Powell Butte<br/>
&gt; 7.  Elk Rock Island<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what the status of these is.  It's been at least a year <br/>
since I've heard a status report on any of these, though I haven't <br/>
heard that any of them are actually missing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  =)<br/>

I just got Spirit of Dartmoor a couple of months ago and there was nothing<br/>
wrong with it -- I would be amazed if anything ever happened to that box.<br/>
<br/>
The Lost Letterbox is fine and was just recently adopted by Brett I believe,<br/>
so I expect it's in really good shape now.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure both Marquam Trail's are missing; I know Warrior Rock is as<br/>
well, and I'm pretty sure that both Japanese Garden and Powell Butte are<br/>
doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure about Elk Rock Island -- I've never even looked at the clues for<br/>
that one.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan covered the waterfalls one, which are WONDERFUL replacements.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps more,<br/>

As of last fall, the "finger" was there, and looked like a finger, <br/>
to me at least.  When looking for the finger, look in every <br/>
direction.  DMS seems to have liked the unconventional...  <br/>

I believe the box that you're thinking of that was missing its stamp was Mt.<br/>
Tabor. The stamp had gone missing, but has been replaced.<br/>
I got Spirit of Dartmoor several months ago and it was just fine, rechecked<br/>
it a few months later, and it was still dandy!<br/>
