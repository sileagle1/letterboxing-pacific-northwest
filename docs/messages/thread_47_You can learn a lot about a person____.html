I rest my case. =)  Although you did throw in that one letterbox at <br>
Bridal Veil Falls just to keep up on our toes.  Like I say, always <br>
keep people guessing.  ;o)<br>

I don't know if it's on the main talk list, but it would certainly be <br>
on Mischief's website (found in the links section).  *clicking around <br>
furiously*  Ah, there it is: <br>
http://home1.gte.net/res0fpfm/letterboxes/bridal_veil_falls.htm<br>
<br>
It's probably a lonely box--most boxers aren't up to such a rugged <br>
hike--so it would love some company.  Catbird and Lizard probably <br>
nabbed it the first weekend it was out there, but I wouldn't be <br>
surprised if they were the only ones to get the box yet!<br>

Hehe.  <br>

I do have to say the hike is SO worth seeing these falls!<br>
