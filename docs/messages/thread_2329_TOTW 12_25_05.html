                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received several letterbox oriented gifts during the last couple of<br/>
days. I got to go hiking along one of my favorite trails in Central<br/>
Oregon. Unlike the previous Sunday, when it was 20 degrees and<br/>
snowing, Christmas day was in the 50s and pretty much dry. The trail<br/>
was deserted except for me and hundreds of robins. They were<br/>
absolutely everywhere, chirping up a storm and zooming from tree to tree. <br/>
<br/>
Then, on Boxing Day someone had success finding my Feathered Joy<br/>
letterbox in Iowa. This box has been in place since last March and<br/>
this is the first I'd heard of its being found. Only one other pair of<br/>
boxers had written me long ago when they tried and failed on the hunt.<br/>
I absolutely loved hearing that it's alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Santa brought me the Japanese rotary drill/punch that I had<br/>
been lusting after for months and months. It drills perfect round<br/>
holes, just the thing for bookbinding. Up 'til now, I had settled for<br/>
a hammer punch, since this slick drill was out of my budget but now I<br/>
have very own ultimate tool. All in all, I was gifted with a wonderful<br/>
Christmas. Funhog<br/>

Yes, yes, yes my daughter (who has accompanied me on several LB <br/>
searches) got tired of the way I was carrying around all my <br/>
paraphernalia. She gave me a neat canvas case with shoulder strap, <br/>
many various size pockets and loops for pens &amp; pencils.  The pockets <br/>
are perfect for stamps and inkpads.  Now if you meet me on the trail I <br/>
will be sooooo organized I will be able to sign in and move on in a <br/>
fraction of the time.  Happy trails and Happy New year to all!<br/>

I've heard of people lusting over many different things, but a<br/>
Japanese rotary drill/punch is a new one for me. =) I am curious,<br/>
though. You'll have to show it to me someday!<br/>

Sounds like a bad pick-up line you might hear at a college bar: <br/>
"Wanna come up to my apartment and see my new Japanese rotary drill/punch?"<br/>

<br/>
I got two letterboxing gifts, from my buddy Homeschoolmommy, a new water bottle to carry Iced Tea while on the trail. And, from my grown son who delights in mocking his Mom and her letterboxing adventures, the entire green spectrum of Tombow brush markers for my shamrock signature stamp.  He also gave me a beautiful leather bound logbook, 3"x4", which I love, but it does have faint lines on the pages.  What to do??  Should I graciously keep the book or exchange it for the unlined variety?  Aw...I guess the lines aren't that bad.<br/>

Nope. Just saving up our money for another trip to/around Asia this <br/>
spring.  Otherwise, not much in the way of gifts at all.  rnrB did <br/>
receive a nice leather journal for letterboxing, though.  Oh, I also <br/>
gave journals to relatives who enjoy letterboxing.<br/>

 No, but I opened a card under the tree and it had clues on it and my<br/>
husband's signature stamp at the bottom. I had to figure out the clues<br/>
to find my present. (It wasn't in a letter box though, that would have<br/>
been even better.)  And he is going letter boxing with me tomorrow. <br/>

I didn't recieve any letterboxing gifts this year but I did give one to <br/>
the letterboxers in Southern California. Since it is the season for <br/>
giving and I was once again visiting relatives for the holidays, I left <br/>
a very nice letterbox in La Verne California in a qaint little park <br/>
with some really neat little "firsties" goodies in it. Merry Christmas <br/>

&gt;  Did you receive any letterbox oriented gifts this holiday season?<br/>
<br/>
Not yet, but I still have presents to open! <br/>
<br/>
I did however go letterboxing on Christmas Day with my sister in San <br/>
Francisco. I was able to find 4 letterboxes before we were due at my <br/>
Aunt's house for Christmas Dinner!!  <br/>
<br/>
I also was able to hide two international letterboxes. One in Munich <br/>
and One in Amsterdam this Christmas Season.  <br/>
