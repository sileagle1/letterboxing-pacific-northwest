<br>
I'm going to be in Bellingham the 3rd - 10th for a wedding that'll happen on the 6th.  Would anyone out there be up for a informal meet 'n greet sometime after the 6th?  <br>
<br>
I know a lot of people are probably on vacation, but for those of you still in town, if you're interested, let me know.  :-)<br>
<br>
Yours in 'boxing, <br>
