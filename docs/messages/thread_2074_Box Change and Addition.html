                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone.  I put up a notice about my first box (ever!) that I <br>
planted in Oak Harbor last week.  Well, I think I gave some bad <br>
directions, and it turns out that the place where I put the box was <br>
not that great because the city is doing extensive lawn work in the <br>
area.  So, I removed the box and replanted it in Fort Ebey, along<br>
with <br>
2 other boxes.  The clues are posted on the website.  This time I<br>
gave <br>
detailed directions so I wouldn't confuse anyone.  There is a<br>
"Quickie <br>
Version" for those who are pressed for time -- just scroll to the <br>
bottom.  Hope ya'll get a chance to check these out!  <br>
