Cooties are something that 'debuted' at the BattleGround Stamp Camp <br/>
last August.  There are other letterboxers much more qualified to <br/>
explain what a Cootie is who are active on this discussion board <br/>
than me--I'll respectfully refer the response to them.  ;)  They'll <br/>
explain it much, much better than I ever could!  Pandora, <br/>

By golly Ryan, I think you've solved the puzzle! maybe it really was <br/>
the girls that had the cooties and maybe thats why the boys in <br/>
elementary school ran from me on the playground haha <br/>
.... I always wondered why they would run from such a cute freckled <br/>
little girl..   ;o)<br/>

Hi erfellie,<br/>
  To answer your question, a cootie was something that Iron Bear, <br/>
Pandora and I cooked up for the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp <br/>
last August as an ice breaker of sorts and something that the kids <br/>
could occupy themselves with. A cootie is a very small furry creature <br/>
letterbox that can only be passed on by hiding it on an unsuspecting <br/>
victim be it in their bag, pocket, hood of their jacket, etc. When <br/>
you were given cooties, you were to stamp into the logbook with a <br/>
thumbprint figure and pass it on to another unsuspecting victim. <br/>
  The cooties turned out to be a big hit and they brought many <br/>
letterboxers that didn't know each other together to mingle and talk. <br/>
I think the kids enjoyed them more than the adults did because they <br/>
got to sneak around and plant them on someone. <br/>
  Cooties are not to be placed in letterboxes because they tend to <br/>
reek havoc on areas that are too confining. I do beleive that they <br/>
are still out there somewhere hiding in someone's bag just waiting to <br/>
be spread around. Keep your eyes peeled. There may be one lurking on <br/>
some letterboxers that you meet on the trail!<br/>
