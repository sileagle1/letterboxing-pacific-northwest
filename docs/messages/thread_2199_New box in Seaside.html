Seaside -- because it is in such a cool place! I can't wait for the <br/>
first person to find it. <br/>
<br/>
I lived in Seaside for many years and wanted to place a box somewhere <br/>
little known by visitors, but special. Most of Seaside's boxes are in <br/>
town or near the Prom. This one is on the edge of town, in the woods <br/>
but with a spectacular view of the sea. And the best thing about it -- <br/>
for some -- is you don't have to hike an hour to find it. <br/>
<br/>
So check out letterboxing.org for "Sunset Boulevard". It would be <br/>
better to find the box before the mud season arrives if you don't want <br/>
to get dirty!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. <br/>
