quite a while this weekend but couldn't find it. Funhog confirmed I <br>
was in the right location - it's either gone or I was standing right <br>
on top of it and didn't see it.<br>
<br>
If anyone knows where it is and can trek out there to take a peek <br>
please do - and let us know if it's still there. Or give me the <br>
specific location and I'll go back and try again. It's such an old <br>
box it'd be a shame if it's missing.<br>
