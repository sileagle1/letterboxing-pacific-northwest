we just returned from Vegas and we has our sights set<br>
on geting a letterbox on the strip. It was one that requires <br>
searching near a statue of some magicians that have<br>
recently made the news. Tons of people dropping off <br>
well wishes and flowers kept us from getting this box.<br>
We had a great time and saw some really great shows.<br>
Later,<br>
