                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi--we ran through Ft S*teilacoom Park today on a mission to <br>
repair/replace some boxes.  We found these boxes today & yesterday <br>
(those not placed by me):<br>
<br>
Pirate's Treasure:  alive & well<br>
Fledgling:  alive & well<br>
Keche:  alive & well<br>
Happy Patriot: alive & well<br>
Waughop:  alive & well<br>
Clown #4: alive & well<br>
<br>
We ran out of time to check any of the others.  I can, however, <br>
confirm that the following are indeed & unfortunately missing:<br>
<br>
Dear Aunt Beth--hiding spot has been decimated<br>
Haunted House--I think the box pirate got this one because it was <br>
alive & well a couple of months ago although it wasn't in its <br>
correct hiding spot when I found it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't <br>
track it down again this time--so I think it's suffered the same <br>
fate as some of the others in the region.<br>
<br>
I'm fairly certain the first in the Nails' Series is missing, too.  <br>
I wasn't using their clues to find it but going off of memory I'm <br>
pretty sure it was no longer there.  Didn't get a chance to check on <br>
#3 in their series.  Perhaps on another trip.<br>
<br>
I did replant a modern Heath Farm LB--so ours are almost all back in <br>
place.  One more left to replace and then our whole series will be <br>
up & running.<br>
<br>
Also, finally--I pulled the Big Tree Inn Letterbox at the end of the <br>
gathering on the 29th of May.  It will be transplanted to a spot <br>
closer to the actual site of the unique venue.  I'll post a note <br>
when that happens.<br>
<br>
While checking on boxes at Ft S*teilacoom Park, I ran into a new <br>
family of letterboxers.  Seems letterboxing was mentioned in an area <br>
Homeschooling Organization Newsletter this past week.  Also, got <br>
news that there was an article on it in another area paper.  I'll <br>
try to track that down & post the link to it.<br>
<br>
See you on the trails...<br>
