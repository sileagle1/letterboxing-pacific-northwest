Hi Amanda,<br/>
<br/>
I found your letterbox inadvertently while hunting wild mushrooms with<br/>
a group<br/>
this Saturday.  I picked it up to show it to the others (not having<br/>
any idea<br/>
what it was about), and wanting to give it a better look in the van<br/>
where it<br/>
wasn't raining.  Unfortunately it slipped my mind as we drove off (it had<br/>
started hailing and we were escaping to lower elevations), and I felt<br/>
bad for<br/>
ruining your nice hiding place under the stump, so I guessed that the best<br/>
course of action was to re-hide it at the next place we stopped.  It's<br/>
now at<br/>
Roslyn Lake State Park, about 3 feet to the right of a sign about<br/>
Alcoholic<br/>
Beverages being Prohibited, hiding under a bushy fern.  I'm hoping<br/>
that you'll<br/>
be able to change the clues to your box online and that this won't be<br/>
too much<br/>
of a setback?  Sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
-Emily<br/>

I have about a dozen boxes near or under stumps in the<br/>
Seattle area!<br/>
I am not sure which letterbox this is! It<br/>
is making me crazy with worry. I think the box<br/>
is now near Roslyn, WA (where they filmed Northern<br/>
Exposure). However, I cannot find a Roslyn Lake State Park on a google<br/>
search. Is anyone familiar with the area out there? I really will need<br/>
help retrieving this box. I am so worried about it lying under a fern<br/>
near a No Alcoholic Beverages sign!! I have emailed this Emily person<br/>
to ask her for more information. And I will keep you guys updated on<br/>
our progress to rescue the box. If anyone has any information that can<br/>
help please email me. <br/>

That is totally amazing - I am terribly sorry to hear about this happening. <br/>
<br/>
On a side note even though you said to e-mail you privately. I wonder if<br/>
they are talking about Lake Easton State Park. That is the only State Park<br/>
that I can think of off the top of my head in that general area with a Lake<br/>
in it. <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck. <br/>
