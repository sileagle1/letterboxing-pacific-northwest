I loved our first get together last Fall.  There I got some ideas <br>
for stamping and logbooks.  Seeing so many stamps and images in <br>
books really gave me some feeling for developing my "crafty" side.  <br>
Being able to see the different kind of carving media helped me <br>
decide that PZ Kut was for me.<br>
<br>
By the time of the event I had logged about 40 LB's, most of them <br>
over the long 4th of july weekend..  It was really tough learning <br>
how to find boxes once I had got to the spot.  Meeting so many <br>
people with a common bond and -------no hidden agenda----- ( that is <br>
not a pun!), like other activities I belong to was refreshing. <br>
<br>
 It was a chance to learn that others had the same challenges I have <br>
when sluthing harder than average clues.  dvn2r skr has since given <br>
me some common sense tips for we of the Short Memmory Clan.<br>
<br>
The food certainly helped too!.  I will be bringing my Deli Buster, <br>
Bethaney ( and some Rice Krispy Treats because I have a hankering <br>
for them and so this is a great excuse)<br>
<br>
The Greater Oly area has some good boxing venues with multiple <br>
stamps.  It is about time to consider Kennedy Creek and all the <br>
Salmon running.  That is a small venue with a wide range of <br>
box "difficulty " levels from basic to Glennish ( I never really got <br>
through those clues with my faulty compass, just stumbled upon the <br>
poorly hidden box.)<br>
<br>
At heart I think many of us are rather private and shy, I know I <br>
am.  Unless work really interferes, I will be there with my log <br>
book, my stamp show and tell, some give away carving media and a HH <br>
if I can come up with an animal expression that fits my theme by <br>
then.<br>
<br>
Oh, and food.<br>
