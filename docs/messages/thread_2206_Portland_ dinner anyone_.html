from Debbie in my in-box that talks about pizza in Gresham on Sept. 3,<br>

and if that's something private or is anyone invited?  It didn't sound<br>
like Debbie was sure about it.  Anyway, I would like to be in the loop<br>
about the food thing.  Debbie, from your description of the hiking you<br>
will be doing, food and maybe a hug are the only things you and I are<br>
going to want to share!  You and family are way out of my league in<br>
the hiking department, but I can eat right along with the best of<br>
them, that's for sure.<br>

  please let me know if pizza on Sept. 3 in Gresham is happening or not<br>
  and if that's something private or is anyone invited?  It didn't sound<br>
  like Debbie was sure about it.  Anyway, I would like to be in the loop<br>
  about the food thing.  Debbie, from your description of the hiking you<br>
  will be doing, food and maybe a hug are the only things you and I are<br>
  going to want to share!  You and family are way out of my league in<br>
  the hiking department, but I can eat right along with the best of<br>
  them, that's for sure.<br>

right now so mistakes happen!  {laugh}<br>
<br>
Obviously we are surprised that so much is going on around the Float Your<br>
Boat Gathering.  So we won't be able to come.  Hubby's taking a week off,<br>
we're leaving early and may do some wandering to boxes in areas we don't get<br>
to often.  Still working out where to go so if there's any suggestions, we'd<br>
appreciate hearing them . . .  maybe hwy 12?<br>
<br>
So sorry to miss you, Kathy.  We'll be making our way UP the gorge as you<br>
make your way DOWN the gorge on Wednesday but it'd be hard to connect<br>
without cell phones.  Hope to see you again some time.<br>
