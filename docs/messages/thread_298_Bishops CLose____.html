garden.  If you have not been here yet, I urge you to go, not only <br>
is it a wonderful place to enjoy a letterbox, as the clue states, it <br>
is just a peaceful walk.  We walked the whole garden, and loved all <br>
the different sights.  My ds saw neat birds, what he called a red <br>
dragon fly and salamanders in a little pond with cool fish!!!!  We <br>
are going to go back again someday just to enjoy the sites.  Thank <br>
you for  a wonderful letterboxing experience Funhog, not only did we <br>
find the box but it took us away from the rush of our daily <br>
lives!!!! <br>
Wonderful box<br>
