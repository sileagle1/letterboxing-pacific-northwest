                    <div class="plaintext-content">3 out of 7 Nails did a tour of Steilacoom, Wa today and had very <br/>
mixed success.  Saltars Point was beautiful, box intact and <br/>
inconspicuously placed in its home.  Chambers Creek Duck is <br/>
just ducky.  However, the Nail Boys had some trouble with <br/>
dvn2rckr's Cold Moon Over Puget Sound.  <br/>
<br/>
We located the park, found the disc, paced our paces and think <br/>
we located the tree of many trunks.  But no box.  Dont know what <br/>
could have happened. This is not really in a high traffic area <br/>
being several yards off of the main trail and not really in direct <br/>
sight of passersby.  Bethany has been victim to many a random <br/>
dissapearance before, perhaps her luck holds.<br/>
<br/>
But worse than No Moon is being stumped by notorious Trial n <br/>
Error.  Farrels Marsh is quite a beautiful place, a gem within a <br/>
very nice community.  The clues were not complicated.  Just walk <br/>
down the path until you see the jumble of logs.  Very direct and to <br/>
the point as most of Bill's clues are.  And just as usual, the clues <br/>
are at the same time just as indirect as he can contrive.  The <br/>
'jumble of logs' turns out to be actually 3 jumbles of logs with no <br/>
indication as to which to search.  The obvious conclusion is to <br/>
search all of them.  I am afraid that every frog, newt, and garter <br/>
snake in the area has been disturbed this afternoon and no <br/>
tuperware (or more likely black vhs box) was to be found.  After <br/>
30 minutes of searching and much muffled grumblings on the <br/>
part of Nailhead, the Nail boys gave up to find other boxes in the <br/>
area.  We will await a response from the Bill who we consider <br/>
the king of  the minimalist clues in the South Sound area as to <br/>
whether it has really walked off before we make another attempt.<br/>
<br/>
2 for 4 is not too good.  But we did make it worthwhile by  placing <br/>
a 'carved in the field' box of our own.  Look for the Nursing the Fir <br/>
Letterbox clues to be posted here and on the main letterbox_usa <br/>
site very soon.  Chambers Creek Park was just too nice a venue <br/>
to have only one letterbox.  After finding the Duck we walked on <br/>
and found a lovely place to hide a small box.  The clues will <br/>
require finding Bethany's duck first in order to orient toward the <br/>
new box.  <br/>
<br/>
All in all it was still a good day.  How could it not be in the South <br/>
Sound with sunshine and 2 eager boys with stamps and <br/>
compass in hand.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had the same experience with both Cold Moon and The Marsh<br/>
<br/>
Cold Moon is very specific and that pace count is that of the non <br/>
child toting Bethany, I am sure.  They were for me very hefty steps.<br/>
<br/>
I had to tackle twice.  I bet you found my multi trunked tree that <br/>
just crys out for a box, but it is another tree a bit on  ( perhaps)<br/>
<br/>
Same with me the notorious T&amp;E marsh box.  Three jumbles and it was <br/>
very hard to see within the proper jumble.<br/>
<br/>
When I went back a second time it WAS RIGHT THERE.  As expected, and <br/>
I wonder where my brain was the first time.  I never saw any newts, <br/>
salamanders etc when I was there :-(<br/>
<br/>
Typical Trial and Error LB.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Too many boxes, not enough time<br/>
