Hi :o) My sister just told me she went to find this letterbox quite <br/>
some time ago and she was confused because there was no stamp inside <br/>
of it. (shes new to letterboxing) the stamp is in Charleston, OR and <br/>
is of an Orca. If anyone has this stamp in their posession please let <br/>
me know (or if you have visited this letterbox and when so we can get <br/>
a time frame). I am hoping its not vandals and that just some <br/>
letterboxer accidently packed up the stamp with their own belongings. <br/>
Thanks<br/>
