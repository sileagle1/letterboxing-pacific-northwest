Glad you found all three.  #3 got more difficult this time, as one <br/>
of my major landmarks to that box (a very large tree trunk), has <br/>
been washed down river at some point.<br/>

&gt; Well the best laid plans...  I thought about placing two new boxes <br/>
&gt; today but just could not get the venue figured out.  I will be <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; patient with the forest service map and perhaps next weekend is <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; reasonable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I did get out and do the Snoqualmie Falls series.  I held off <br/>
&gt; until Mischief replaced one box that may have been swept away by <br/>
high <br/>
&gt; water.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I used my usual scientific method and was reading the clues to box <br/>
&gt; two as I approached the "clearing" and realized that Mischief <br/>
wanted <br/>
&gt; me to use my compass.  Sitting snugly in the car, at the top of no <br/>
&gt; use.  Guess I should have read all the clues before starting out ( <br/>
&gt; lesson learned, again)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well thanks to a good clue and reasonable choice I FOUND her #2 <br/>
box.  <br/>
&gt; However the new box Love Falls depends on a compass too.  I tried <br/>
&gt; dead reckoning, the "be the compass" technique and the "every LB <br/>
&gt; hiding site looks like the others with artfully arranged bark" <br/>
&gt; technique.  I could not use the sun to orient, go figure.  Sorry <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; say I could not come up with the box, so a return visit is in <br/>
order.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mischief #3 box was a challenge and I was very lucky to find the <br/>
&gt; little rusty sign and pick out the right sitting rock.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All thru the AM thunder rumbled and I was about 100 feet from the <br/>
car <br/>
&gt; when the rain opened up.  HUGE gloppy raindrops.  In other areas <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; the country hailstones are always called marbles, golf balls etc.  <br/>
&gt; These rain drops were definitely in the marble class.  WOW.  All <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; tourists huddled in rain gear, I had on a cotton short sleeve <br/>
shirt <br/>
&gt; and shorts. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mean, it is summer!<br/>
