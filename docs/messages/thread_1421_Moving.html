but didn't know when.  Now I know that I'll be there in the middle of July<br>
and I'm looking forward to planting some new boxes and finding all of your<br>
boxes.  I'm relocating from Ohio to Anderson Island, Washington with my 14<br>
year old daughter Nicole and my fiance Paul.  I hope to get a chance to meet<br>
everyone!<br>

been fortunate enough to see the sea lions and dolphins so far.  The <br>
orcas tend to hug the western side of Anderson Island as they take <br>
their day trips to Olympia.  One day I'll be the one to report the <br>
orcas to the Whale Hotline:<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I truly can't wait to get there.  I grew up in Maryland near the shore and<br>
moved to Ohio 2 years ago.  There is hardly any water here in the lower Ohio<br>
Valley, especially when you're used to ocean fronts and lots of moisture.  I<br>
thought I would shrivel up and blow away from lack of moisture my first<br>
winter here.  And I won't miss the snow & ice, that's for sure! And the<br>
LOUSY drivers!  I don't plan to leave the island except to letterbox, shop &<br>
work the gun show circuits.<br>
<br>
I can't wait to hit letterboxes, Mt. Rainier & Pike Place Market.  I need to<br>
start running again.  I ran track in school but have sluffed off since I was<br>
married many years ago and went thru a divorce.  I do love chai tea though<br>
but that I like iced.  I will be opening up a tea room out there, not sure<br>
if on the island or not but it'll have a nice shop in it.  Our online store<br>
has journaling items, teas, antique desk sets & ink bottles, quill pens, etc<br>
and letterboxing supplies.  http://www.inkandfeather.com/store/  We're still<br>
adding since we closed our store here in Ohio.  I also have a<br>
preparedness/tactical store, Bear Mountain Tactical, which I have been<br>
packing up this weekend.  It's new website will be www.bmtactical.com  We<br>
sell law enforcement, military, tactical supplies as well as civil defense,<br>
emergency preparedness supplies and LOTS of military surplus.  Our surplus<br>
is all GOOD stuff, not the old WWII stuff that you can hardly use anymore.<br>
Everything from tents, (GP Mediums, USMC 2-man tents), the new sleep<br>
systems, light kits, generators, lots of gear that we use for hiking &<br>
camping.  And we're the lowest on the internet.  We go through and check<br>
everyone's price & then undercut it if we can.  If we can't then we don't<br>
sell that product for the most part.<br>
<br>
I work for American Tomahawk Company  www.americantomahawk.com which is also<br>
located on the island.  We don't have a retail store but we're setting up<br>
out shop/production facility.  I currently telecommunte which I've done for<br>
4 years. Now I'll actually be there to work.  I also write and am working on<br>
a children's series.<br>
<br>
We have 3 black labs, one which is going to my boss, we also have 2 cats and<br>
a scorpion.<br>
