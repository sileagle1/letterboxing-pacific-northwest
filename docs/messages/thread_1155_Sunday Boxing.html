  It was awesome, loved the stamps and learned some history along the way.  <br/>
Thank you.<br/>

Tried to find the Olympia Watershed boxes, with no luck... the instructions <br/>
weren't making sense to us, so we must have made a wrong turn or <br/>
something... any hints would welcomed!<br/>
<br/>
Still planning on the leap year event!<br/>
<br/>
Talk to everyone soon, Jessi<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to send a big thank you to Maiden and Camp Fire Lady - <br/>
We met up at my house this morning to get together to plan the Camp <br/>
Stamp Event coming up in August, I really encourage anyone that can <br/>
make it that weekend to come on out, the three of us have some great <br/>
things planned out and I am just positive there will be some things <br/>
you all don't want to miss.  I must say that I am very honored to be <br/>
hosting this event with these wonderful Ladies.<br/>
<br/>
After our meeting we said good-bye to a hurried home for a birthday <br/>
party Maiden, and Camp Fire Lady and I headed out in search of a <br/>
certain mystery box but came up empty handed. I grabbed another <br/>
Mystery Box and another addition to Mom, Mexico and Me that I hadn't <br/>
found out my first two hikes through the park.<br/>
<br/>
Then we were off to Lake Oswego to hit the Bon Apetie (sp) Series. <br/>
We found 2 of 3 and ended up getting ourselves a little turned <br/>
around in the park, alot hungry, pretty tired, overly thirsty and my <br/>
suggest of cutting through and heading back on the surface streets <br/>
ended up to be a really bad idea and a rather long detour! So back <br/>
up the hill yet again, back through the park and I must say, I'd <br/>
never been so happy to see Camp Fire Lady's car before!!<br/>
<br/>
But a great fun day, Thank you Camp Fire Lady for driving me around <br/>
today in Iron`Bear's absence!<br/>

It was my pleasure Pandora. I really enjoyed boxing with you and <br/>
Maiden. It makes for some great letterboxing stories. *grin*<br/>
I too hope that all of you can come to this great Stamp Camp event <br/>
being planned for August 27-29. It's amazing what ideas a bunch of <br/>
creative women and of course Iron Bear can come up with when we put <br/>
our heads together. There will be some awesome stamp images to <br/>
collect from the event that were created by Iron Bear that you will <br/>
absolutely want to have in your logbooks!<br/>
For all those attending the Mystery Gathering this weekend in Tacoma, <br/>
there will be a preveiw of the activities that will be offered at the <br/>
Stamp Camp in August.<br/>
See you Saturday in Tacoma!<br/>

box I've been to 4 times before. Tarnished Knight, being my hero, managed to<br/>

<br/>
Great box, beautiful day, and wonderful drive.<br/>

Thanks Der Mad Stamper for another memorable letterboxing day!<br/>
