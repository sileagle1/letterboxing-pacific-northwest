Oh ho, funny question.  Out of those you've offered, I like "herd" the<br>
best, just because I like the mental image that pops up.  I'm offering<br>
"pod" because slugs are gastropods, and I like to go boxing with just<br>
a few friends rather than a whole bunch of people - pod sounds smaller<br>
somehow than herd or swarm.  'Course it won't be an appropriate term<br>
for those who live in areas where they aren't blessed with the<br>
presence of the slimy little critters wherever they go.<br>
