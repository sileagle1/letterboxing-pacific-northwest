Greetings Funhog,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's good to hear that you are on the road again, though sorry to hear that<br/>
letterboxing is more productive than finances these days.  What part of the<br/>
road are you traveling?  It is unfortunate that you can't check on the maybe<br/>
missing pandora boxes but I am sure that I will be up and around soon enough<br/>
and get there myself.  I tried to go out yesterday and walked through a<br/>
small store and from the car to the restaurant we were having lunch in and<br/>
paid for it all night and still today.  It is amazing how much you take for<br/>
granted the small things you can do using your abdominal muscles until they<br/>
are too sore to do them with.  Thank you again for your compliments on the<br/>
Children's Song series and my carving, I am really flattered.<br/>
<br/>
As for the information about Fright Fest, I hope this doesn't upset anyone,<br/>
but I will repost the information here.  I mean no offense in doing this<br/>
RayvenDad, it is just that I realize that several letterboxers access their<br/>
emails via portable devices and it is difficult for them to view websites<br/>
and more costly for them then just downloading the text in this format.<br/>
<br/>
Taken directly from the website:<br/>
<br/>
Come one come all! Newbies and veterans alike! Team Rayvenhaus invites you<br/>
to the first annual Fall Letterbox Gathering, Fright Fest 2003!<br/>
<br/>
Rayvenhaus is providing the Burgers and the buns (Hamburger buns! Sheesh!<br/>
This is a family venue here folks! (Grin!)) and the fixings to go with that,<br/>
Ketchup, mustard, mayo, tomatoes and lettuce and my mother is bring her<br/>
famous Watergate salad!<br/>
<br/>
All you folks have to do is show up, bring a covered dish and provide your<br/>
own refreshments and we'll have a frightfully wonderful day of friendship,<br/>
food and letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we are carving a event stamp. (WooHoo!)<br/>
<br/>
Now for the who, what, when, where and why!!!<br/>
<br/>
Who: All letterboxers that wish to attend!<br/>
<br/>
What: The First Annual PNWLb Fright Fest `03!<br/>
<br/>
When: Saturday, Oct 25th, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Where: Wapato Park in Tacoma, Wa.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The address of the park is:<br/>
<br/>
Wapato Park<br/>

Tacoma, 98408<br/>
<br/>
Coming from North (Seattle, et. al.) travel south on I-5 to exit #129 (72nd<br/>
Ave) and proceed to the 72nd Ave crossover, not the 74th. 72nd will take you<br/>
under the bridge and back around to you are facing north. Turn to the right,<br/>
heading south, so you cross over I-5. Proceed east on 72nd, passing a sign<br/>
for Wapato park on the left, to Sheridan Ave. Turn left, North, on Sheridan<br/>
and proceed approx 1/2 mile, to the park entrance on the left. Enter the<br/>
park and at the roundabout, head right at the start, rounding the roundabout<br/>
to the left so you end up heading towards the parking lot to the left of the<br/>
entrance. Find a parking spot!<br/>
<br/>
Coming from the South (Portland, et. al.) travel north to exit #129 (72nd<br/>
Ave). At the intersection, turn right, heading east. Proceed east on 72nd,<br/>
passing a sign for Wapato park on the left, to Sheridan Ave. Turn left,<br/>
North, on Sheridan and proceed approx 1/2 mile, to the park entrance on the<br/>
left. Enter the park and at the roundabout, head right at the start,<br/>
rounding the roundabout to the left so you end up heading towards the<br/>
parking lot to the left of the entrance. Find a parking spot!<br/>
<br/>
We're in the main covered area in front of the lake.<br/>
<br/>
And on and added note to Ryan regarding his HoHoHo post.  I had to laugh,<br/>
Ryan you are always one to stir up trouble.  And here they all think that I<br/>
am the creator of chaos.  Just thought I would make you smile by telling you<br/>
that we all irritate the hell out of each other sometimes.  I believe that<br/>
is what makes life and friendships interesting.  I know the day I stop<br/>
irritating people once in a while I will now that the end of the world is<br/>
soon at hand.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>
