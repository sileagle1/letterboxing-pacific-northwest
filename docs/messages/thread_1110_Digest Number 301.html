I am not sure what is going to make one qualify to teach/demo stamp carving<br/>
.... I personally would be willing to do such a thing if I had an idea of<br/>
what you are looking for exactly, however, I am also not sure who is<br/>
attending and there may in fact be much more talented carvers than myself in<br/>
attendance.<br/>
<br/>
Totally up to you guys,<br/>

&gt; WooHoo!!<br/>
&gt; The more the merrier is my motto! Don't worry about the stamps!! I<br/>
&gt; started out the same way a couple of months ago! Heck..we may even<br/>
&gt; inspire you all to come up with your own stamp!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hmm...speaking of which...would anyone be interested<br/>
&gt; in "teaching/demoing" stamp carving? I'd be willing to track down<br/>
&gt; some plumbers gasket and bring my carving tools? The kids attending<br/>
&gt; may get a kick out of learning about carving! Plus, any of our new<br/>
&gt; adult/teen letterboxers may come away from the event with a signature<br/>
&gt; stamp!!Any takers??<br/>

I suspect that this person (as most of us) can learn best by watching<br/>
SEVERAL folks demo -- we all have different carving styles and she (as<br/>
would anyone else) most certainly benefit from multiple styles to watch<br/>
and learn from :).<br/>
