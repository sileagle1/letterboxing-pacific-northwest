I am not sure what is going to make one qualify to teach/demo stamp carving<br>
.... I personally would be willing to do such a thing if I had an idea of<br>
what you are looking for exactly, however, I am also not sure who is<br>
attending and there may in fact be much more talented carvers than myself in<br>
attendance.<br>
<br>
Totally up to you guys,<br>

I suspect that this person (as most of us) can learn best by watching<br>
SEVERAL folks demo -- we all have different carving styles and she (as<br>
would anyone else) most certainly benefit from multiple styles to watch<br>
and learn from :).<br>
