                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had the best time this last weekend -- neice Braidy and I went to <br>
Bend to visit family, and we picked up 4 boxes, 1 Friday, 3 Sunday.  <br>
All 3 on Sunday had hitch hikers in them.  What fun!  One appears to <br>
be carved in linoleum, which I've read about but never seen before.  <br>
<br>
So there will be an influx of HH's in the general Portland area over <br>
the next few days.  One of these little buggers came all the way <br>
from Connecticut with Mark & Sue and Letterboxing Ham & Lazy <br>
Letterboxer a few weeks ago...  <br>
<br>
The following boxes are all in fine condition, well-hidden and very <br>
neat carvings:<br>
<br>
Waterfowl Highway<br>
Hollinshead Park<br>
Duck Soup<br>
and Cline Falls<br>
<br>
Also in good condition, I've recently found:<br>
<br>
Blue Lake Willow<br>
Blue Lake Park<br>
and (3rd times a charm, how blind am I) See Spot Run<br>
<br>
My thanks to all the owners!<br>
