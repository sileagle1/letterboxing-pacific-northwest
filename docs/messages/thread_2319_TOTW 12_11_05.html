Definitely the clues aspect attracted me, going out to find something<br/>
that someone had hidden.  That part still satisfies the child in me. <br/>
Nothing like a good old fashioned treasure hunt!<br/>

&gt; What was it about letterboxing that attracted you to this hobby in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; first place?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When the Washington Post article on letterboxing came out way back <br/>
when <br/>
we had just visited Chantilly, Virginia for a several week business <br/>
trip and hiked in the very park they mentioned in the article.  I <br/>
couldn't believe that there were little 'boxes' hidden along the <br/>
very <br/>
trails we'd hiked that we hadn't even noticed.  East Coast 'woods' <br/>
are <br/>
quite different from the West Coast in that the trees seem to be <br/>
very 'sparse' and there's little to no 'underbrush' so you can see <br/>
for <br/>
yards and yards unlike here in the NW.  So, that's what initially <br/>
intrigued me--how could they possibly hide a letterbox in that <br/>
terrain <br/>
that yielded few to no natural hiding spots?  At the time, I was a <br/>
frustrated injured athlete who was desperate for a form of exercise <br/>
that would not exacerbate my injuries---letterboxing was the perfect <br/>
way to go.  Easy on the body, allowed you to go at your own pace <br/>
and 'bonus!' you didn't need a babysitter for the kids!<br/>
<br/>
Since then the clue writing, discovering new spots and the carving <br/>
has <br/>
grown on me.  Definitely the gift of 'expression' in the clue <br/>
writing <br/>
and interweaving bits of history resulting from my research of <br/>
unique things <br/>
continue to pique my interest, too!<br/>

trails.  It is the ability to enjoy something together as a family.  It  <br/>
is a chance to meet new people and enjoy the things that nature provided <br/>
for us.  It is a way to teach our children about a multitude of <br/>
different things as they come up with new ideas for boxes.<br/>
<br/>
All in all it remains simply something that the entire family can enjoy <br/>
together, and in this day and age, that is priceless.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm new (about three weeks into the hobby) and only have found 10 or 11 so<br/>
far.  We discovered letterboxing accidentally when googling Elk Rock Island<br/>
on an afternoon outing.  I had just finished reading Fugitives and Refugees:<br/>
A Walk in Portland, Oregon by Chuck Palahniuk (highly recommended for all<br/>
visitors or residents of PDX - or for any homosapien who likes a good travel<br/>
journal - not really a guide book but a series of observations from his 25<br/>
years living in PDX) and wanted to check out Elk Rock Island since I live<br/>
real close by and had never even heard of it.  Well, the first thing that<br/>
popped up was Der Mad Stampers Elk Rock Island box so since two 4 year olds<br/>
were going on the trip I figured . . . treasure hunt - GREAT!!!  Well we<br/>
figured out the part about the tree but spent most of the afternoon trying<br/>
to figure out what the #$%^ green 13 was (I figured it out last weekend from<br/>
across the river - haven't gone back yet though) and after the girls began<br/>
to melt we abandoned the effort, but I was hooked and spent most of the<br/>
evening reading about letterboxing on the web.  The fact that there were 6<br/>
boxes listed within walking distance of my house (Sellwood area) got me out<br/>
the next few days to collect Adele, Sophie, Wallace Books, &amp; Oaks Bottom.<br/>
Looked for Quackers . . . couldn't find it (but found a geocahce and now<br/>
have $%^&amp;*!@ Christmas colorforms all over my windows) and looked quickly<br/>
for the Oaks Amusement one (listed as MIA on the web).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, that's my story.<br/>

ROFL! <br/>
<br/>
When I first read about letterboxing, it was only in England and I <br/>
thought it very cool and quirky of those British! I was intriqued by <br/>
the mysteriousness of it and I thought it was great that it got you <br/>
outside actually participating in the treasure hunt. (Rather than <br/>
being an armchair traveler reading and solving mysteries in books or <br/>
on the computer)<br/>
<br/>
As a huge Nancy Drew fan and fan of reading mysteries, this was a <br/>
chance to participate in my very own mystery. And I still like those <br/>
mysteries the best. The ones that you can't figure out on the <br/>
computer, the ones where you have to be out there on the trail and <br/>
then it all becomes apparent.  That "Ah Ha!" moment, is the reason <br/>
that I got into letterboxing.<br/>

I was wondering who this Holly Carpenter person was. Now it's all<br/>
coming together....<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of weird reading this board nowdays. There's a Rick Simpson<br/>
here now, and every time I see a post by him I think it's my<br/>
brother-in-law whose name is Rick Stimson. Scott Carpenter I always do<br/>
a double take too. Scott is my middle name and I think, "Huh?! Is<br/>
someone playing a joke on me?" Then there's a Samantha Stephens, which<br/>
I get this weird feeling I've met before who used to live in Arizona.<br/>
I didn't know her very well, but I could swear her last name was<br/>
Stephens too, but that's just too far of a bizarre coincidence to be<br/>
true. Or is it? *raised eyebrows*<br/>

If you want to add a level to the coincidence Scott is my middle name also!<br/>

  &gt; ps - my wife wrote a short article about letterboxing for one of the<br/>
  &gt; regional sections of the Oregonian last week.<br/>
<br/>
  I was wondering who this Holly Carpenter person was. Now it's all<br/>
  coming together....<br/>
<br/>
  It's kind of weird reading this board nowdays. There's a Rick Simpson<br/>
  here now, and every time I see a post by him I think it's my<br/>
  brother-in-law whose name is Rick Stimson. Scott Carpenter I always do<br/>
  a double take too. Scott is my middle name and I think, "Huh?! Is<br/>
  someone playing a joke on me?" Then there's a Samantha Stephens, which<br/>
  I get this weird feeling I've met before who used to live in Arizona.<br/>
  I didn't know her very well, but I could swear her last name was<br/>
  Stephens too, but that's just too far of a bizarre coincidence to be<br/>
  true. Or is it? *raised eyebrows*<br/>
<br/>
  This is the Bizarro World of the talk lists.....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It would seem my neighbor knew more about me than I knew myself. When<br/>
he was taught about letterboxing while getting his Master of Arts in<br/>
Teaching degree at Lewis and Clark College, he copied all the<br/>
classroom materials and handed them to me. He figured I just might be<br/>
interested. Little did he know what a monster he'd released!<br/>
<br/>
I have long been an enthusiastic hiker; I travel all over the dang<br/>
place for business; and I am very curious about solving mysteries. All<br/>
of these fit perfectly with the wacky hobby of letterboxing. Once I<br/>
studied up, I also realized that the underground aspects of boxing<br/>
made it all the more appealing. I love feeling that I'm doing<br/>
something sneaky but am most likely not going to get into any kind of<br/>
trouble for it. It feeds that rebellious kid side of my adult self.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, the neighbor who first introduced me to this rolls his eyes and<br/>
laughs when I tell him about my latest adventures. He now teaches<br/>
fifth grade in SE Portland. I guess I was one of his first students.<br/>
