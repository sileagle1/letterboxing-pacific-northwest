<br>
 Our family is thinking about taking our annual notbacktoschool campout at <br>
Lake Quinault. I understand that there are several letterboxes in the area, <br>
so we thought we'd combine letterboxing with our annual September campout. I <br>
just love camping in the middle of the week when everyone else is at work or <br>
school!<br>
