more for the 2XL and 3XL sizes. They will be available to purchase in<br>
a couple of weeks. I will order a few extra shirts but to be sure you<br>
get the right colors and sizes, please send me a note.<br>
<br>
Pre-orders have been received from: Kelly G., Bernadette, Mariette,<br>
Maiden, Team Springamajack, Amanda, John 4D Toes, Mystic Dreamer, Lady<br>

If you're not on the list, I didn't get your request. Did I miss anyone?<br>
<br>
You'll be happy to hear that Sluggo will be making an appearance on<br>
the back of the shirt! Many, many thanks to Funhog and Wildhair for<br>
all of their help with the artwork.<br>
