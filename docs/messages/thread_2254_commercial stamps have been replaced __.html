                    <div class="plaintext-content">During my monthly visit to see our grandson yesterday I got out and<br/>
put new hand-carved stamps in the Lonely Juniper box.  I'm very proud<br/>
of them but left the commercial stamps in there because I kind of like<br/>
them too.  I have a bit of sentimental attachment to them.  I took my<br/>
grandson with me, and he stamped into his first letterbox at the age<br/>
of seven weeks.  He slept through the whole thing but made some funny<br/>
noises when I wiped the ink off of his little foot with a cold<br/>
wet-wipe.  I'm just going to use his feet until they won't fit in log<br/>
books anymore.  I took clues to eight boxes, wanted to get into one of<br/>
funhog's and at least one of 4Dtoes and birder's, but we just didn't<br/>
have time.  Anyway, the new stamps are there now waiting to be used,<br/>
thanks to the encouragement of Der Mad Stamper and funhog.<br/>
