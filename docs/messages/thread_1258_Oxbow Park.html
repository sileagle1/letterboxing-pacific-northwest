wonderful evening hunting boxes last Saturday at Oxbow reagional <br>
Park. I had not been there before and I loved it. Can't wait to go <br>
camping now. Anyway, due to the setting sun we ran out of time for " <br>
the birds and the bees series", but believe box #1 might be missing. <br>
The area looked thrashed where we thought it was hidden. <br>
<br>
Oxbow adopted LB and Riverbend LB were Alive and well!<br>

Happy spring<br>
