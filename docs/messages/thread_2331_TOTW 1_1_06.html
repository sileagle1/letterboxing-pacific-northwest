&gt; Tell us about your letterboxing resolutions/plans for the New Year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I came to tell what I got for Christmas and find the topic has changed<br/>
so I'll just double post here - my daughter gave me a lovely yellow<br/>
vest that has my trail name embroidered on it - she had it made up<br/>
just for me, which was so sweet.  My husband gave me a sleeveless<br/>
shirt that says "get a clue, go letterboxing" on it with a cute little<br/>
tree.  I liked it so much I had to order the hooded sweatshirt to match.  <br/>
<br/>
After today, my resolution is to carve a stamp for my husband and I to<br/>
use together.  He has been using a stamp our daughter carved or his<br/>
thumb when we go together.  He seems to be coming along and/or<br/>
instigating boxing trips more and more, although he laughingly talks<br/>
about all the physical discomforts (getting soaked and stuck with<br/>
blackberries, etc.)  Yesterday he said I could pick some boxes at the<br/>
coast and we would go check out the high tides and flood waters.  Boy<br/>
was it wild!  Don and Gwen's box at the observation tower was fun to<br/>
get, but we got totally soaked by water blowing up over the jetty and<br/>
hitting even people up in the tower.  A great day to go to the coast.<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year to all.    <br/>

OH!  We're so sorry to hear that box is gone - it was a great stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year to all of you in the PNW, we enjoyed meeting several of you<br/>
in AUG/SEP 2005 and had a great time hiking in the gorge and Mt. Hood area!<br/>

Well, our new years resolutions are to get out and box more.......not <br/>
so much for the boxing ( sorry ) but for the exercise, the boxing is <br/>
just incentive!!!!!  I would also like to make Mark ( hubby ) and Kyle <br/>
(son) their own signature stamps.  ( I think Mark may get more <br/>
involved if he has his own stamp!!!)  I would like to put a few boxes <br/>
out this year too, as I don't have many of my own!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year!!!<br/>
