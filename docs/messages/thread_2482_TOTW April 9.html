<br>
Hmmm...we've come across a bunch of weird stuff.  Here's the blurb <br>
about it from our AQ profile answer with some elaboration on the <br>
experiences:<br>
<br>
SWAT teams forced us off the trails--twice(Wonderwood Park in Lacey, <br>
WA), police line(s) (multiple locales), crime scene (stolen purse <br>
debris scattered about an entire hillside in Golden Gate Park in San <br>
Francisco which we returned to the police), whizzing bullets in the <br>
distance and cops that later showed up to investigate it (Priest <br>
Point Park in Olympia, WA)--dead orca calf (Hole in the Wall, <br>
Olympic Peninsula), horse skull (Auburn, CA), rattlesnake <br>
(Ellensburg, WA), tarantula (Alum Rock Park in San Jose), dead sea <br>
lion (Moclips, WA), mating elephant seals (San Simeon, CA)...Good <br>
friend 14,000 miles away from the high school we attended 14 yrs <br>
later (we were on Oahu & attended high school in Germany) & some <br>
medieval outdoor adventure game (can't remember the name of it but <br>
they link up via the internet somehow) players in Spanaway, WA--they <br>
threw this 'grenade' at me not knowing I was there and were shocked <br>
when they went to retrieve it seeing that we were there stamping <br>
into a letterbox (the grenade was made out of stiff foam wrapped in <br>
duct tape and they were all dressed in these dark 'duster' jackets <br>
and gear)--not sure which experience ranks as the 'oddest' yet, <br>
though...  <br>
<br>
Oh, two weeks ago we came across some other 'odd' stuff at Blue Lake <br>
Park near Troutdale, OR--it involved a studded belt and Ralph Lauren <br>
boxers.  Yeeeeeee-uuuuuucccccckkkk!<br>
<br>
<br>
Thankfully, the great experiences we've enjoyed in letterboxing far <br>
exceed the number of odd ones.  daelphinus<br>

Being the tightwad that I am, I was probably more floored that somebody <br>
would even consider 'abandoning' a pair of $30 underwear in the <br>
woods!  ;)<br>
