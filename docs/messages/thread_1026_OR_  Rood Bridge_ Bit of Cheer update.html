Hey Wingnut your stamps are awesome, however, one needs a canoe and/or scuba gear to get to a couple of them.  2 bridges in the park are under water.  But we had fun anyway, plant some more, we'll be back.  Beautiful carvings; Chipmunk, opossum, and frog doing great any others either under water or inaccessible due to flooding.<br/>
<br/>
Bit of Cheer stamp is very cheery.  It was a bit wet, we dried it and re did the baggies.  Nice park too.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the fun!<br/>

first to submerge!  hahahaha  Wingnut<br/>
