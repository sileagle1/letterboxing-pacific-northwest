A word of warning - I'm having trouble going down hill too. Actually, <br>
any time my knee is bent and bearing weight. Finally went to the Dr. <br>
and found out I have what they call Femoral Patellar syndrome (pretty <br>
common) - the knee cap is tilted and way off to the outside grinding on <br>
cartilage instead of gliding nicely in the center. This is caused by <br>
the big outer thigh muscles being much stronger/tighter and shorter <br>
than the inner leg muscles so I am doing Physical Therapy <br>
(strengthening of inner and stretching of outer) but it maybe too late <br>
for me - the cartilage/meniscus eventually gets so roughed up and <br>
stringy that it gets caught/pinches in the joint. I imagine massage <br>
would also help too.<br>
Anyway, don't be too tough or stubborn or procrastinate - get it looked <br>
at before you need surgery!<br>
Happy Hiking!<br>
