The photos work okay as long as you drill down deep enough. The<br>
thumbnails clearly wouldn't have enough detail, and even the medium<br>
sized photos lose a lot of the detail, but the large versions come out<br>
very clear! So just keep clicking till you get the to the large<br>
version. =)<br>

This is a cross-post from the Washington discussion board at Atlas <br>
Quest reference the event map/directions found in the photo section <br>
(soon to be found in the photo section of LbPNW, as well).<br>
<br>
Hey, I noticed on the event 'map' photos in Atlas Quest that I wasn't <br>
able to read the text on the images.  GT mentioned to follow <br>
the 'cascade' of photos down to the largest size and then you should be <br>
able to read them.  I did that but still the text was illegible.  But I <br>
noticed by clicking on the Explorer Toolbar at the top of the <br>
window: 'View', then 'Full Size' it would pull up the photo to the <br>
point I could read all of the text clearly.<br>
<br>
If you run into this problem, perhaps this work around may help?<br>
