<br>
I would still like to go, even if only for the day! I have taken<br>
Friday and Saturday off of work, and I only live an hour and a half away.<br>
<br>
Will there be a meeting place? I've never been to one of these before.<br>
What kinds of things take place? Will there be a time that everything<br>
starts? <br>
<br>
thanks!<br>
Becca<br>
PS. I will possibly be driving up by myself. Anyone is welcome to join<br>
me! (two seats may be taken, I will have to check on that.)<br>

exchange and perhaps a potluck but other than that it is freetime for <br>
boxing or doing whatever you wanna do. This doesn't mean that if <br>
anyone wants to volunteer to do a carving or book binding demo or <br>
pinata time, etc. they can't - it is just that I won't be setting <br>
anything other than the exchange/potluck(s).<br>
