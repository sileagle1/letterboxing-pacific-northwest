it must have heard before we found it! ALMOST gave up numerous times <br/>
but Old Blue is an engineer and ALWAYS finds a way.<br/>
<br/>
The Shakespeare box (ours) has a new stamp! It was the first box we <br/>
placed over a year ago and had a store-bought stamp in it. It now <br/>
sports a wonderful self-carved one not to be missed! So, if you've <br/>
gotten it before, get it again. And, there's a BONUS: another <br/>
Shakespeare (#2) letterbox was added. Check it out!<br/>
