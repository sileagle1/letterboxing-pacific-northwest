and shooting the Salem breeze with Kernville's own Don &amp; Gwen!!!  What <br/>
a delightful couple!  It was so neat to finally meet them in person <br/>
after all these years.  These two incredible folks have led us on some <br/>
really neat adventures around the West Coast!  We look forward to <br/>
meeting up with them again in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is such a cool hobby and it's mostly because of the <br/>
awesome people who make it happen!  Don &amp; Gwen epitomize that with <br/>
their great letterboxes--awesome stamps, exquisite locations and unique <br/>
clues!!!  Thank you for the adventures!!!<br/>
