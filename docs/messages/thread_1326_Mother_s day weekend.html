                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went camping at Milo McIver SP Sat night and Sun<br/>
night.  Had a great time camping/boxing.  We didn't<br/>
break the record 21 boxes set last week, but found a<br/>
respectable fifteen, including our 100th.  That<br/>
memorable one was the first box of the Jurassic Park<br/>
Series.  We managed to find all but a few that we were<br/>
looking for, 14/19 plus a HH(our second)!  So not a<br/>
bad weekend of boxing.  <br/>
<br/>
Seeing all of the stamps from the gathering last<br/>
summer, we can't wait for an opportunity to attend<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
We also came up with a great idea for a series, we<br/>
just need to put it together and find a place to hide<br/>
it.<br/>

and get the Jurassic Park and a few other series completed there.  <br/>
Pusa we'd like to get those in Battleground that CampFireLady and <br/>
Willow (And others now) have planted and then there's a few in Lewis <br/>
county that we really need to get to. One of these days, drive down <br/>
to Milo McIver and just box our way back up I5 to Tacoma!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, as we need to get the Elbe Train one as well.  Good excuse to <br/>
head up to Mt. Rainier again and check on our box there as well.  <br/>
Busy days ahead!<br/>
