image form.<br/>
<br/>
What about a view East from the mouth of the Columbia?<br/>
<br/>
You cover the Pacific, the river, the mountains North &amp; South and <br/>
can incorporate the arid areas east of the Cascades as the river <br/>
continues to the horizon toward the top or back of the patch.  Or it <br/>
could even veer North/left like it does in reality and the terrain <br/>
toward the rear left to right behind the river bend could go from <br/>
arid to rolling wheat fields--maybe even incorporate the Wallowas, <br/>
too?  The right/south could incorporate waterfalls.  The river could <br/>
have a salmon/orca swimming in it?  The lettering could be swimming <br/>
in the river--above the horizon or beneath the image.<br/>
<br/>
The possibilities are endless...  <br/>
