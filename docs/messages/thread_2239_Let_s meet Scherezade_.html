named Scheherezade is currently visiting the Pacific Northwest all the <br/>
way from Michigan. I'm planning to meet with her for a sandwich and a <br/>
brew this coming Saturday evening, and hope that some of you can join <br/>
us!<br/>
<br/>
We will be meeting on Saturday, September 17, 7:30 PM, at the Lucky <br/>
Labrador Brewing Company, 915 SE Hawthorne, in Portland. This is a dog-<br/>
friendly brew-pub, so feel free to bring your pooches!<br/>
<br/>
See you there!<br/>

understand that Sheherezade is a real cat lover!  But with all those <br/>
pooches around, it might end up becoming a doggy treat, so that might <br/>
not be a good idea.<br/>
