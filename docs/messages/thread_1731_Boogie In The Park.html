Sorry this is such a late post. My computer is not cooperating with <br/>
me. Thank you Team Rayvenhaus and Team Chaos for a wonderful <br/>
gathering. I could not have expected anything less from you guys. <br/>
Although I would have liked to take credit for this event, I did not <br/>
have a hand in the planning of it but thank you all for the kudos <br/>
anyway. I was so nice to finally put the faces to the names and <br/>
meeting some new letterboxers. Cat's Meow and I had a wonderful time <br/>
meeting you all. Hey, who were those two guys that kept going by in a <br/>
blurr on the trail? Sure would have been nice to talk with them for <br/>
awhile but I guess they were too busy trying to get every single box <br/>
in the park! You guys are insane! Thanks again guys for a great time!<br/>

"To laugh often and love much; to win the respect of intelligent persons and<br/>
the affection of children, to earn the approbation of honest critics; to<br/>
appreciate beauty; to give of one's self, to leave the world a bit better,<br/>
whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition;<br/>
to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exultation; to know<br/>
even one life has breathed easier because you have lived--that is to have<br/>
succeeded." - Ralph Waldo Emerson<br/>
<br/>
Ralph Waldo Emerson was a man that truly understood some of the<br/>
infinitesimal and yet paramount things in life - to bad he didn't know about<br/>
Letterboxing because I believe that his words that you just read would have<br/>
been a little different. Nevertheless - this weekend proved to be a time<br/>
that Ralph Waldo Emerson was talking about, without question. <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks have already gone out to the Letterboxing community for the<br/>
Family Fun 2 gathering - and my expressions are not going to be any<br/>
different from everyone else that has commented. I would like to thank each<br/>
and every one of you for coming to this tremendous gathering. I will not<br/>
mention people by name - because the reality is that each of you stood out<br/>
to me in your own unique and individual way. So I thank you for making my<br/>
experience a memorable one. You are the living and breathing essence of what<br/>
Letterboxing is - I had the honor of meeting the vast majority of you out on<br/>
the trail somewhere during the day. Because for a good portion of the event<br/>
Der Mad Stamper and I were the flashing blur that you would see dashing<br/>
through the forest. But I think that is one of the most prolific ways to<br/>
meet a fellow Letterboxer - to see their eyes light up - or just stepping<br/>
out of the shadows after re-hiding a box - despite the cold rain and hale. <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, it was as Mr. Emerson said - "to have played and laughed with<br/>
enthusiasm and sung with exultation; to know even one life has breathed<br/>
easier because you have lived--that is to have succeeded." The smiling faces<br/>
- the enthusiasm that I saw despite the cold rain and hale - gave me pause<br/>
and made my being at this event all worth it. As the quote states you made<br/>
my life breath and bit easier. I stood back with ardent pride as I saw all<br/>
these wonderful people talk and exchange stamps - stay warm by the fire -<br/>
laugh with old friends and shake hands to greet new ones. I was exuberant<br/>
when I saw the reaction to the cooties by the kids and the adults - who I<br/>
think couldn't help but be a kid as well from time to time. The food - what<br/>
can I say - it was the best - and it was the little additions of things like<br/>
the familiar welcome sign - gifts bags - and event stamp that made it even<br/>
more special. <br/>
<br/>
The park is an amazingly beautiful one - but this weekend it became even<br/>
more so with the addition of some of the most wonderful Letterboxes I have<br/>
been able to hunt down. I could see that the people in our community had<br/>
given of one's self - and left this world a little better with a few tokens<br/>
of themselves - a box - logbook - stamp- and clues.  Der Mad Stamper and I<br/>
weren't able to get all of the boxes that were planted for the event.  We<br/>
missed one - sorry Heather just ran out of daylight. In addition to that we<br/>
got almost everything that was already there but ended up not hunting for a<br/>
few I think four actually. All of them were treasures to behold - and I am<br/>
honored to of had the chance to get them. I will certainly be returning to<br/>
get the rest soon. <br/>
<br/>
Last but not least - I have a heartfelt apology to make. I had gone out<br/>
before the event and planted four boxes for you all to enjoy several days<br/>
before. When pandora and I returned home - pandora proceeded to sit down and<br/>
write the clues from my terrible writing skills for you to enjoy. When she<br/>
read it back to me - what she read was not what I heard obviously because<br/>
there were several places that the clues were wrong. So terribly wrong that<br/>
there was no way anyone would be able to continue to hunt for this series<br/>
and complete it. Unless of course you had just happened to see Der Mad<br/>
Stamper and I take off in the right direction and go along with us for the<br/>
series - such as Heather did. So with that said you all have my most sincere<br/>
apologies - it has taught me a valuable lesson and will hopefully not happen<br/>
again. I have corrected the errors in the clues - and if anyone would like a<br/>
copy right away please just let me know in a private e-mail and I will send<br/>
them out to you as soon as I can. Otherwise the new clues will be posted to<br/>
the respective websites later on. <br/>
<br/>
So thank you all once again for showing up - laughing - playing - loving -<br/>
respecting - appreciating beauty - giving of yourself - and making this<br/>
world a better place. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well. <br/>
