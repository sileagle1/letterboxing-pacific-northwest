                    <div class="plaintext-content">well, we have had two boxes go missing within the same area in the<br>
lastwhile. One we just checked days ago, and now it is gone.<br>
The culprits put all 'hiding debris' back as it was, but take the<br>
entire box. Both places are not easily found, one of them, you almost<br>
have to have the clues, this one went first.<br>
so, <br>
what shall we do?<br>
We are supposed to be checking two more boxes today that we planted<br>
last week, as long as the rain holds off.<br>

<br>
Take two geocaches hostage for each letterbox that goes missing and<br>
say you won't return them until the letterboxes are replaced in their<br>
original locations without damage.<br>
<br>
Just kidding. ;o)<br>
<br>
But seriously....  I'm not sure there's a whole lot you can do.<br>
Sometimes boxes go missing because some hoodlum just thinks it's<br>
funny. Some people make their clues "tricky" to discourage that. (At<br>
least then if they swipe a box, at least they'll have to WORK for it!)<br>
Others turn clues into WOM boxes help discourage theft or vandelism.<br>
And a few boxes on Atlas Quest are listed as being for premium members<br>
only for that reason (under the assumption that anyone willing to pay<br>
for premium membership probably isn't the kind of person to start<br>
stealing letterboxes). Speaking of which, you don't have to be a<br>
premium member to list premium member only boxes. A misconception some<br>
people have. ;o) (As another aside, I'm donating all money from<br>
premium memberships this month towards helping the victims of<br>
Hurricane Katrina, so signing up this month would even be for a good<br>
cause!)<br>
<br>
As for what to do about the boxes that are already missing--it's up to<br>
you. Perhaps the vandals have had their fun and won't check back<br>
looking for replacements if you replace the letterbox. Or maybe they<br>
will check back and keep an eye on the location to vandalize any<br>
replacements that come along. There's not enough information to know.<br>
Maybe waiting a month or two and then replacing the boxes will thwart<br>
a vandal who gets bored of checking the location to find nobody has<br>
done anything about the missing box and stops checking the location.<br>
<br>
One person I know who's suffered from missing boxes in the past has<br>
put hexes and curses on some of his boxes, though I'm not sure how<br>
effective that practice has been. ;o) I do like the idea, though. At<br>
least then if a box goes missing, you can shake your head sadly and<br>
think, "Poor guy, running around with the nose of an elephant and the<br>
tail of a pig. Well, I guess he deserved it." =)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just chalk it up to the fact that no matter how good we hide them<br>
someone (person or critter) is gonna stumble across'em from time to time. <br>
Some folk'll look at them, become interested and join the hobby, some<br>
folk'll put'em back and forget about'em and some folk'll toss'em away<br>
thinking they're trash.<br>
<br>
If we see signs of actual destruction and/or vandalism then we'll move the<br>
replacement to another location. Otherwise, we recarve and replace.<br>

It's like having children..... At some point in time you have to cut the<br>

Some signs and symptoms of inner peace: (Be careful, you just might suffer<br>
from this!)<br>
A tendency to think and act spontaneously rather than on fears based on<br>
past experiences. An unmistakable ability to enjoy each moment. A loss of<br>
interest in judging other people. A loss of interest in interpreting the<br>
actions of others. A loss of interest in conflict. Frequent, overwhelming<br>
episodes of appreciation. Contented feelings of connectedness with others<br>
and nature. Frequent attacks of smiling. An increasing tendency to let<br>
things happen rather than make them happen.<br>
