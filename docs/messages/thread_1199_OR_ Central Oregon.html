new boxes planted recently by Birder. We ended up getting the first 2 boxes in <br>
the Arch Canyon Series. What a beautiful canyon! Thanks to Birder for <br>
shownig us some incredible sights and for some wonderful stamps! Our hike <br>
was cut short as my son Josh tripped and skinned his knee. We still had a <br>
great time. Looking forward to getting the other 3 and the other boxes.<br>
Later,<br>
The Fleshmans<br>
