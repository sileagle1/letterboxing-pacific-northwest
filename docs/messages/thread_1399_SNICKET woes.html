beach.  Not sure if she's on her way, yet, perhaps you can contact <br/>
her for assistance?  Our experience in that region is that one of <br/>
the trails is guaranteed to be closed when the nation's security <br/>
level heads to a 'warmer' color (we learned that 200 mile roundtrip <br/>
lesson the hard way a while back) which is indicative of why <br/>
there's 'added interest' to folks poking around the bushes in the <br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hiking,<br/>
