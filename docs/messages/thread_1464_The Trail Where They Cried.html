was so inspiring that you had to attempt it but the trail that you <br/>
need to follow at times would disappear and become so treacherous <br/>
that it was difficult to navigate. Walking through the burned out <br/>

because you are passing through a lush green forest into a barren <br/>
section of land but coming upon 3 different lakes to cool off in. The <br/>

I'm glad you guys made it up there - I have to agree with you that the Trail<br/>
Where They Cried is quite the treacherous trail; I think we had Ryan and<br/>
Funhog in mind when we planted that series - we wanted to give them<br/>
something a little harder than our normal boxes to do.  I think the other<br/>
influence was that I have to agree with you - the stamp images for the Trail<br/>
where they cried is by far the best carving I have ever done and really<br/>
shows Iron Bear's artistic ability - we had found a few Indian images that<br/>
were what he was looking for - but when he freehand drew them and altered<br/>
them to fit his location I was amazed at what wonderful stamp images they<br/>
made.  Also, the letterboxes where planed before we got there, it was an<br/>
area Iron`Bear had been to before and had some very special experiences at,<br/>
at each stamp was very specifically drawn to where it was located.  So when<br/>
we discovered that there had been a fire there, we decided to plant them<br/>
anyway, I think the name of the series is very fitting to the trail and the<br/>
story involved in the letterbox is something we can all learn a little bit<br/>
of Native American history from.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm so happy you were able to get the images, and I totally agree Cat's Meow<br/>
deserves a pat on the back - Iron`Bear and I would not have taken Sim Kitty<br/>
on that trial, so I think Cat's Meow did magnificent.<br/>
<br/>
And having seen you both when you stopped by after your hiking and can<br/>
honestly say it was the first time you looked more tired than she did!<br/>
Hehehe<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for all the complements,<br/>
Pandora{I`B} (I'm sure Iron`Bear would agree, but he's still sleeping)<br/>

This is to date the most wonderful series of stamps we have gotten and are honored that Iron Bear and Pandora are sharing their hearts, skill, and beauty with us.<br/>
<br/>
  The hike itself is not only beautiful and educational, but gives a feeling of nature at her best and worst!  This area is one of our most favorites anyway and they have added so much more to our bond with the spirit and nature of the area.   Fire damage and beetles have taken their toll here, but it is still a must see!<br/>
<br/>
  The clues, the story and the stamps were exceptionally well prepared and the logbooks themselves merit a hardy "WOW".<br/>
<br/>
  The emotional and physical symbolism is so well done that when you reach your goal you have to stop and just look and listen to everything around you.  You can imagine the brother walking along the ridge.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you so much for enriching our lives with your letterboxes.  Even after 3 weeks from when we searched them out, we still reflect on them and remember how much you have contributed to our love of nature and the spirit of humankind.<br/>
<br/>
They have placed other boxes, also in the area, which are much fun and beautifully made as well. <br/>
<br/>
This is a series not to be missed!  Keep them coming!  <br/>

I just wanted to take the time to write you and extend a personal thank you<br/>
to you for the wonderful comments you had on our Trail Where they Cried<br/>
Series.  The Series is very close to Iron`Bear's heart given his Native<br/>
American heritage and I'm very proud of the stamps we created on that<br/>
series.  I am so glad that we have been able to touch you through our boxes.<br/>
Your comments today actually brought tears to my eyes, I think the reaction<br/>
you had to our boxes is every planters dream come true. Thank you for<br/>
sharing it with us and I hope we can create boxes in the future that touch<br/>
you as much as they did.<br/>
<br/>
Pandora<br/>
