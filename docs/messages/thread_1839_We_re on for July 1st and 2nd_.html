Looks like we have critical mass! The group site officially takes up <br>
to 25 and we've gotten close to that head count already (count us as <br>
4) though I'm not sure if everyone is planning to stay both nights <br>
or not. Note that the group site is a single fee deal that I've <br>
covered ala the Milo Gathering. <br>
<br>
If folks can keep posting if they plan to come that'd be great: <br>
group site C is available as of now if folks think another is <br>
warranted someone could reserve that one too - but we should do so <br>
soon if not earlier!<br>
<br>
PS, Sorry for any folks that can't make it this weekend.<br>

we can make it down there on the first (Friday night). Is it going to <br>
be possible to stay over on the 3rd (Sunday night) as well? We would be <br>
five people and a tent.<br>

We had so much fun at stamp camp las time, and the park sounds <br>
beautiful.<br>
