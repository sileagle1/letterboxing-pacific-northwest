Airedale Terrier set out for a fun afternoon of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
We started at the "Now and Then" series of boxes in Seward Park. Great<br/>
clues wound us through the park to the "Now" box. It was in a video tape<br/>
box that was open and wet on the inside. All was dry though in the bags. We<br/>
replaced several zip lock bags for insurance. Inside was the Lambton Dragon<br/>
Hitchhiker, my first! It is a beautiful stamp as some of you know.<br/>
Dvn2rckr's stamp in the "Now" box is fantastic! I'm glad we took along<br/>
different colored felt pens to really make it come alive.<br/>
<br/>
It was on to the "Then" box. We found it in its cubby hole which holds<br/>
water. The box was quite wet but again the contents were dry in their bags.<br/>
Old bags were again replaced with new ones. Another fine stamp carved by<br/>
dvn2rckr. We put some sticks in the bottom of the cubby hole where it<br/>
resides to try to keep the box above the waterline. Hope that helps!<br/>
<br/>
Then it was on to the Kubota Park letterbox placed by Amanda from Seattle.<br/>
It was a beautiful Easter Sunday in Seattle and a walk through Kubota Park<br/>
was just what the doctor ordered. Many plants and trees were flowering and<br/>
the smells were of deep springtime. This box was quite wet inside as well,<br/>
but the contents were dry in their zippy bags. We again dried out the<br/>
entire box and made colorful stamps with Amanda's fine carvings! We also<br/>
replaced ziplock bags in the hopes of keeping things dry.<br/>
<br/>
I really wished we had some rubber bands to lock down these boxes. It will<br/>
be an item I take next time. Also a spare box or two, just in case!<br/>
<br/>
I can't explain just how much fun it is to get out into the beautiful parks<br/>
with good friends and a trusty dog in search for letterboxes. Outstanding!<br/>
<br/>
Keep looking, my friend.<br/>
