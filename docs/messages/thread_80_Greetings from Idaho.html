Come on out to Idaho for a visit.  We're slowly getting <br>
letterboxers.  I'm so excited.  I'll be back to Washington next week <br>
for a couple of days so I'll have to start printing off the millions <br>
of new letterboxing clues for that state and Oregon as I drive out <br>
there. =-)  <br>
<br>
Aren't you feeling pulled out to Idaho for a visit??<br>
<br>
Have a blessed Easter tomorrow.<br>

Are you travelling from Oregon to Utah on I84?  There's a Welcome to <br>
Idaho letterbox (easy) right as you come into Idaho from Oregon(which <br>
might be missing, but I plan to replace this Friday).   There are <br>
others in Idaho anywhere from 5-20 miles drive off the interstate.  <br>
I'll be sure to see about planting some more drive by ones just for <br>
you.  What a great incentive for me to have to letterbox some more.  <br>
=-)  More to come.  <br>
Thanks for coming to Idaho.  I'm so excited.  =-)<br>
