Central Oregon. Friday's schedule was absolutely grueling: pastry at<br/>
the Sisters Bakery, The A Day in Sisters Letterbox plus a HH, a<br/>
customer, The Cold Springs Letterbox, another customer, The Calliope<br/>
Crossing Letterbox, and then...another customer. Now that's my idea of<br/>
a business trip: Changing from shoes to boots every hour or two. I<br/>
especially like the clever clue for the Cold Springs box and the<br/>
lettering on the Sisters stamp. Many thanks to Birder and the<br/>
Fleshmans for contributing to a very successful day.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday entailed a trip back over Mt. Hood to attend the Roadhouse<br/>
Gathering. I second everything said by Paisley Orca. I had a grand<br/>
time meeting everyone and was only sorry that it wasn't long enough to<br/>
really sit down and talk to everyone. <br/>
<br/>
After the Gathering died down, I dragged the famed Ryan and Amanda<br/>
back to my house for a head-chopping game of guillotine. This morning,<br/>
we solved a letterboxing Conundrum and visited some old friends to<br/>
release some HHs. Funhog<br/>
