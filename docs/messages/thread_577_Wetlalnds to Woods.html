Din Din and I headed for Gabriel Park to track this one down. Cute<br/>
little stamp and a grade schooler's insight regarding the source of<br/>
the carved eraser. One glance and Din Din said, "Oh they must have<br/>
school kids. We got those erasers for Run for the Arts." What an<br/>
appropriate application considering the source! Funhog  <br/>

<br/>
How many boxers out there have already found all 6 stamps? <br/>
<br/>
How long ago since these were seen?    <br/>
<br/>
And is anyone able to give us a couple of hints, maybe off line to point us in the right direction for the elusive last 2?<br/>
<br/>
We found the murder weapon, an eye witness, and 2 objects that prove what that witness saw.  Now we are stumped, and have scoured several areas near and far.  Our trail has grown cold and winter approaches.  Joe HH has left the area, but we are still on his trail.<br/>
