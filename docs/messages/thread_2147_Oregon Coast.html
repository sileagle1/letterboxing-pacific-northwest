We are off to the coast this weekend for some letterboxing (and<br/>
camping). Our first stop is Cannon Beach. We don't plan on going North<br/>
of Astoria or South of Tillamook.<br/>
<br/>
And must sees? Ones to avoid (all day hikes)? Anyone in the area and<br/>
would like to do an exchange?<br/>

Becca, we were camping at Cape Lookout over the 4th of July and I<br/>
enjoyed maiden's box "maiden heart" - also found, adopted, and moved<br/>
birder's "Cape Lookout" box, writing new clues.  My 83-year-old mother<br/>
and I hiked up and found "Bessie" at Munson Falls - a very short hike<br/>
considering the fantastic waterfall reward at the top.  There is a<br/>
picnic table at the falls for looking at the letterbox, and although<br/>
there are a lot of people coming and going, it is easy to grab it and<br/>
re-place it without being seen.  I'm sure you would enjoy all three,<br/>
and none involve walking more than a mile or so.  The Munson Falls<br/>
hike is the longest, and it's only one mile.  You might be the first<br/>
to sign into the newly placed "Cape Lookout," and birder's stamp is<br/>
really cool.  Have a good camping trip.  We love Cape Lookout<br/>
campground because it is right on the beach, but I am not sure you<br/>
could get a spot there this late - they often fill up.  The day park<br/>
area is very big and has LOTS of nice spots, again right on the beach.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Can't figure out how to edit my original reply, so will just reply to<br/>
my own post - the "maiden heart" box was placed by the brat pack, not<br/>
maiden alone.  Maiden is one of the few people I've met so far, and I<br/>
got confused because she is part of brat pack.  <br/>

<br/>
Both the original Ecola and its replacement letterboxes are still <br/>
there---somewhere.  The challenge is figuring out where the 16+ <br/>
geocachers who mentioned finding one or the other (those are the <br/>
ones who put it in their geocache log entry--how many others found <br/>
it but didn't mention it?) over the past 12 months <br/>
actually 'replaced' the letterbox when they were finished perusing <br/>
it.  I last personally set my own eyes on it in Jan 05.  The last <br/>
few geocachers reported finding the letterbox on:<br/>
<br/>
29 &amp; 26 June, <br/>
21 &amp; 7, 7 May<br/>
27 Apr<br/>

<br/>
Who knows where the letterbox is.  It's funny--one guy even <br/>
mentioned finding TWO ecola letterboxes before he found the <br/>
geocache.  So, they're both there (the original and version 2.0 <br/>
because the first one wandered off)--somewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
I may just kill this letterbox, though.  Too much of a pain to <br/>
maintain it (while living 500 miles away from it roundtrip) with so <br/>
many geocachers finding it stat letterboxers.  The box itself is <br/>
labelled all over it that it is a letterbox, not a geocache and to <br/>
rehide it exactly where they find it.  Each time I've checked on it, <br/>
I've found it several meters away from it's original hiding spot.  <br/>
I'm chalking it up to a lost cause...  :(  Sorry--it was my attempt <br/>
to introduce letterboxers to a little known fact of Lewis &amp; Clark <br/>
history.<br/>
