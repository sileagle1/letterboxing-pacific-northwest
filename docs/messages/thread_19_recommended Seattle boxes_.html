Does anyone happen to have any other suggestions of "must-dos" for my next <br/>
trip to Seattle?  I haven't been up north since discovering letterboxing, but <br/>
I'm beginning to think it's time for a visit.  I'll be trying to recruit my <br/>
Seattlite friends into LBing, so I guess I'm looking for boxes you might <br/>
especially delight in, for one reason or another.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well the formerly mentioned box because of the nifty area it takes <br/>
you through.<br/>
<br/>
The Carkeek Park boxes because they have a variety of fun stamps. I <br/>
think 8 all together.<br/>
<br/>
A mysterious, if not fishy, box in a park in the city (you will have <br/>
to figure out where), because of the wonderous trees that are there.<br/>
<br/>
Kubota Gardens because of Kubota Gardens.<br/>
<br/>
These 4 venues will take you to two quadrants of the city so the <br/>
first two could be done together, the second two ditto.<br/>
<br/>
These are just in the city.  I won't brag on the boxes on the East <br/>
side ( cough cough)<br/>

B boxes (except for the Primatives...which are charming, but <br/>
primative)<br/>
<br/>
Bridle Trails has the most bang for your buck with 9!! letterboxes in <br/>
one park!! (over in Bellevue)<br/>
Or you can spend a day in West Seattle and get up to 11 letterboxes. <br/>
(some driving around involved)<br/>
