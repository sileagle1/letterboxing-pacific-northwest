Longview tomorrow. :) We've planted several boxes in the area <br/>
already, but found some missing a few days ago (I'll include a <br/>
separate message about those later). Since I'll be in the area this <br/>
summer, and for many years to come hopefully, maybe I'll see about <br/>
that class. I'm not sure what all I'd have to offer, but I'm sure <br/>
y'all would be happy to give me volumes of knowledge beforehand. :)<br/>
