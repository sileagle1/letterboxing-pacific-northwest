letterboxing these days, check out the chinook runs at the New <br>
Market Falls and '7' Oars letterboxes right away.  We must've seen a <br>
couple hundred 3'+ chinooks and about a dozen seals looking for <br>
dinner.  Truly one of those neat adventures--children will really <br>
get a kick out of these sights.<br>
<br>
For best views, you can see the seals/chinook action best at the 4th <br>
Ave bridge near downtown Olympia.  Either park as you would for <br>
the '7' Oars LB or you can park on the North side lot of Capitol <br>
Lake and cross the street heading toward the bridge (this is where <br>
the KFC used to be).  There's a perfect little overlook there that <br>
affords a great view of all the 'brackish' chinook activity.  Then, <br>
head South to "New Market" Falls Park (this will require some <br>
research) and you can see the 'freshwater' action there.  Oh, <br>
there's also a free salmon cycle poster giveaway near the Falls Park-<br>
-they may even have some salmon identification key chains for you, <br>
too!  Really interesting for the kids!!!<br>
<br>
Chinook are running a bit early this year--so don't miss it!<br>
