<br/>
A few things:<br/>
<br/>
1) No fireworks (including sparklers) are being allowed to be used in <br/>
the state parks so leave them at home (or at least don't light them) <br/>
if you were planning to bring some.<br/>
<br/>
2) If anyone is dragging along family members not so enthralled with <br/>
letterboxing remember that the Oregon Garden is nearby and may be a <br/>
worthy diversion for them. Note that they will have fireworks there on <br/>
Sunday night. Disclaimer - we've never been so I don't know if it is <br/>
really worth a trip or not. Their website is: <br/>
http://www.oregongarden.org/ <br/>
<br/>
3) Don't forget to be on the lookout for something pungent!<br/>
