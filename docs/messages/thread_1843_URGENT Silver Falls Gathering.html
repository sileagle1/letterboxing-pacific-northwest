You can count on me to be there. Since the number of cars is an <br/>
issue, I will try my best to hitch a ride with someone else from the <br/>
Portland area, if I can find someone with a little extra room for a <br/>
Mad Stamper and his tent. I'm really looking forward to it!<br/>

Finding room to fit in a Mad Stamper and tent would be no problem whatsoever. It's <br/>
that honkin' big letterboxing vest that he wears that might put a kink (or is it Klink) in <br/>
the works. <br/>
<br/>
I think he has at least two or three stamps carved from each of the materials he lists <br/>
in his last post, including the potatoes, stored in the myriad pockets. Then there's the <br/>
inkpads representing every shade on the color wheel, not to mention the carving <br/>
tools, plastic bags and bottle of cider. Anyone who offers to bring this guy to Silver <br/>
Falls may as well rent a U-Haul, just to be safe. Funhog<br/>

Okay, okay... I'll leave the potato stamps at home, and try to limit <br/>
myself to no more than 3 shades of blue.  But the cider goes with me, <br/>
or else I'm staying at home!  -- DMS<br/>
