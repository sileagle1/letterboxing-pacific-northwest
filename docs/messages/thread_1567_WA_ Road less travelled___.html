                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, for a quick update on some boxes we visited along the way home:<br>
<br>
Along the oft travelled route:<br>
Happy Postman--(5 of 6: Big Bad Wolf appears to be missing)<br>
Cherokee Flag<br>
AIDS awareness<br>
Don't pass go...<br>
Lewisville Gathering<br>
Lucia Falls<br>
Luv Ya<br>
Moultan Falls<br>
--we weren't so luck with Chelatchie Railroad--not sure if we were <br>
stumped or if it was the stump that stumped us.<br>
<br>
THEN, we took the path less travelled:<br>
<br>
We spelunked with a member of the pongidae family, then we soared <br>
with an eagle near the cliffs.  Next, it was off to a beautiful <br>
majestic sunrise, capped with an incredible view of The Mountain and <br>
our adventures ended with a great hike to an alpine lake adjacent a <br>
gorgeous cascade Meadow. The lake was named for sheep but that's not <br>
what we found in it--instead we found a man swimming in his birthday <br>
suit!  Talk about an adventure!!!  Not exactly what the Green Turtle <br>
experienced on his descent from denny creek a few years back but <br>
definitely something fairly close to that.  Only this man wasn't <br>
wearing hiking boots, either!!!  ;)  We snuck in a couple of other <br>
incredibly memorable hikes around these adventures but these were <br>
the ones that resulted in 'lasting' impressions.  ;)<br>
<br>
All in all, a great drive home to cap an extraordinary Stamp Camp <br>
weekend!  If you're ever looking for a way to get out and see <br>
nature's gems (minus the hoards of tourists) this route is <br>
definitely THE way to go!!!<br>
