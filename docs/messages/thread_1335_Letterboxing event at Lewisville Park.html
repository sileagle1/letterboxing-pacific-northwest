stamp a FABULOUS event stamp, and then traveled around Battle Ground Lake to<br/>
see Camp Fire Lady's Spring Bouquet series in the wild.<br/>

A couple of weekends ago our group stumbled upon a geocache at Eagle Fern<br/>
Park. It was interesting to see for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see more people at the next gathering! It's always fun to meet new<br/>
people, get new ideas, and share some laughs.<br/>

event and carving the beautiful event stamp.  And thanks for all the<br/>
hints and tips and advice and exchanges and hitch hikers, and<br/>
travelers and good company. Such a great group of people and I enjoyed<br/>
meeting all of you and there were so many boxes to be found, what a<br/>
treat! <br/>
