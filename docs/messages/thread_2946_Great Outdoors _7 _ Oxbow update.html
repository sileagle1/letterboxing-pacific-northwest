                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK.  Things have changed significantly at Oxbow Park.  Quite a bit <br/>
of trail damage and downed trees from the recent weather.  Some <br/>
trails are so covered with debris that you can't tell the trail is <br/>
there.  Some trails are closed.  Some are washed away by the Sandy <br/>
River.  <br/>
<br/>
Including some of the trails in the Great Outdoors #7 series.  So <br/>
here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Group Camping Area 3 is no more.  The shelter was removed some <br/>
months ago, I hear, not because of the recent weather.  Clue will be <br/>
updated shortly, to reflect it's disappearance.<br/>
<br/>
Box 1 missing.<br/>
<br/>
Box 2 happy and healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Box 3 missing.  This area looks like it was flooded recently.  <br/>
<br/>
Box 4 is fine.<br/>
<br/>
Box 5 is fine.  Directions have changed (trail name was changed from <br/>
L to J).<br/>
<br/>
Box 6 present and accounted for.<br/>
<br/>
Box 7 I forgot to look for the hollowed out cedar on the right.  I <br/>
think it's gone.  Just watch for the cedar on the left, just off the <br/>
trail, and watch for a suspicous clump of moss.  You'll find it.  <br/>
It's not a long section of trail so if you don't find it the first <br/>
time, double back and try again.  Box is there.<br/>
<br/>
Box 8 missing.<br/>
<br/>
Gimme a few weeks and I'll have these recarved and replaced.  Since <br/>
some boxes were clearly in better hiding places than others, I'll <br/>
probably reduce the boxes placed and just double-up on stamps in <br/>
existing boxes.  That'll probably reduce "losses" in the future as <br/>
well, but the puzzle can still be solved.<br/>
