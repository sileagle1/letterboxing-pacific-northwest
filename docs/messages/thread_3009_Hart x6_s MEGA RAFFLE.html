<br>
::::THE BACK STORY::::<br>
<br>
As many of you know, we've had a rough couple of months.<br>
<br>
The last official day of our week long trip to South Dakota began with a trip to the Emergency Room for Becki. She had a kidney stone and the pain was unbearable. After about 3 hours, she was released and we made the long drive to Sioux Falls. She didn't get any rest that night, we were to drive home that day. Instead, we went to another Emergency Room.<br>
<br>
I took the kids to a park, a few hours later I got a call from a nurse informing me that Becki was going to be going in for surgery. The problem wasn't so much the kidney stone but now a bad infection had set in. They just put stints in, and didn't remove the stone (as that would've spread the infection).<br>
<br>
The next day I got a call from the hospital informing me that Becki wouldn't be going home that day, and it wasn't looking good for the day after that either. I drove more than half way home, meeting Becki's mom just west of Des Moines, IA to pass off all the kids and then turned back to Sioux Falls. I ended up spending another two nights.<br>
<br>
So, our trip ended up being 3 extra nights in a hotel, 9 extra meals, 2 ER visits, 1 hospital stay, 1 surgery more than we planned. Once home, Becki had the kidney stone blasted away . . . and finally the ordeal was over -- except for the bills.<br>
<br>
Our church helped cover the hotel nights & meals.<br>
<br>
Our bills totaled about $45,000 and after insurance, a fundraising night, and countless phone calls/letters/applications for financial assistance, we are left with about $12,000.<br>
<br>
In addition to the twelve grand (and without the back stories), we need 4 new tires for each of our minivans ($1,200), a new refrigerator ($500), and a new furnace (still waiting on estimates) -- ALL since the kidney stone issue at the beginning of June.<br>
<br>
::::THE RAFFLES::::<br>
<br>
In an effort to raise additional monies to pay off our medical bills, I am raffling off most of my (Hart x6)hand carved stamps (that haven't been planted) & LTC's.<br>
<br>
16 raffles will be for individual stamps. Some older than others. Some more detailed than others. Each will be sent out with a brief description of when I carved it and why I carved it.<br>
<br>
2 more raffles will be for sets of stamps. One set is of my earliest carvings, on Pink Erasers. Another set used as a reward system for my kids when they were very little. I will send further description with the stamps to the winner.<br>
<br>
1 raffle will be of my LTC's -- a copy of many of the LTC's I've ever made.<br>
<br>
The final raffle will be of a custom stamp I will carve for the winner.  The image will be chosen by the winner! I will have the winner send me a picture of what they want carved, collaborate with them, and then carve it for them.<br>
<br>
TWENTY RAFFLES!!<br>
<br>
Raffle Tickets are $5 each - or BONUS - 5 tickets for $20 (receive an extra ticket for every $20 given)!<br>
<br>
"Tickets" will be a slip of paper with your name on it - put into ONE bucket. We will have someone randomly pick a prize -- and then draw a name (from the bucket) of the person who wins that prize.<br>
