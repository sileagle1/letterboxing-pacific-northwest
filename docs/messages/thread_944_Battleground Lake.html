are you saying we aren't young?  We certainly aren't making a profit!<br>

<br>
I believe your camping book needs to be updated. When I camp there I <br>
always make a reservation. They do not have group sites but the camp <br>
sites are close enough so that you could have your own space and just <br>
walk a few steps to mingle with other campers. What do you think <br>
letterboxers? Would you like to have a Stamp Camp planned for say <br>
maybe the weekend of April 16-18, 2004 and have the theme centered <br>
around Earth Day? I would be willing try my hand at the event stamp <br>
and get the details for the cost of the sites at Battle Ground Lake, <br>
etc. You would need to call and make your own reservations. If people <br>
would like to volunteer to do maybe a workshop on stamp carving, book <br>
binding, compass 101, etc. People could mail me their letterboxes <br>
before hand and I could place them for the event. Stop me before I <br>
get too excited. Whew! Let me know what you think.<br>

<br>
My book is about a million years old, weather-beaten and falling apart.   <br>
<br>
>They do not have group sites <br>
<br>
I just called the park and they DO have a group camp...WooHoo!<br>
PLUS, it has four Adirondack shelters with eight bunk beds in each<br>
one, a group fire ring, a tent area and parking for about fifteen<br>
cars. There is no room for RVs. The cost is $2 per person per night,<br>
limited to 64 campers. <br>
<br>
The Earth Day Events at Tualatin Hills Nature Park have been fun but<br>
the weather hasn't alway cooperated. I'm such a camping wimp that the<br>
idea of having a covered area sounds great to me. If I were in town at<br>
this time, I would defintely try to come.<br>
<br>

Tent camping in April sounds too wet for me, but group camps with<br>
shelters or yurts are a very inticing incentive.  If we could be spared<br>
the elements to some degree (while visiting and sleeping) we would be<br>
glad to show up for such an event if we're available.  Sounds like<br>
FUN!!!<br>
