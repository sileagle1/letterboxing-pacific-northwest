Yes, and thank you!  Add count 1 to your R count -- for Rescuing my box!  I didn't even realize they were going to clean the place out.  That really was a lucky Rescue.  I will miss the Shop, for the occasional Saturday afternoon diversion we got from it.  Thanks again, DMS.<br>

I'm Happy to report that I have managed to rescue the beautifully-carved Saints Letterboox... and only a few days before they started clearing the place out! (whew!) I'll get it back to Double Tree as soon as possible. --Der Mad Stamper--- In LbPNW@yahoogroups.com, "doubletreepfx" <greenthummm@...> wrote:>> It appears that the Saints Thrift Shop at Mt.
