                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all! <br/>
<br/>
Here's the low down.<br/>
<br/>
On October 1st, 2005 31 people gathered at 9:30 to receive their "info<br/>
booklet". Included in that booklet was the rules of the day, a map of the<br/>
park, a poker cheat sheet,  and the official score card. Also included were<br/>
the clues to 52 boxes hidden in the park. Each box contained a stamp<br/>
representing one card from a deck of cards. The rules pointed out that there<br/>
was in fact a 53rd box, the Joker, if you could find it. The clues were<br/>
folded in half and sealed so that no one could look at them until 10:00. At<br/>
10:00 AM, all guests were welcomed and instructed to open their clues. They<br/>
then had 2 hours to search out as many boxes as they could. No where on the<br/>
clue sheet did it indicate which card was at which location. Once you found<br/>
a box, you could stamp it into your log book and then you had to decide<br/>
whether you wanted to stamp it on to your official score sheet. The official<br/>
score sheet had room for only 7 cards. With 15 minutes left we blew a<br/>
whistle to give everyone a heads up. At 12:00 exactly, those that had<br/>
returned had their had scored by the pit boss. Ryan had the winning hand<br/>
with a full house. (Including the Joker). He received a beautiful wooden box<br/>
that says "Poker Grand Champion" on it. Double Tree and Braidy got the prize<br/>
for most boxes found (13). They received a hand made fleece poker blanket.<br/>
The second place person got a set of ceramic poker coasters, third place got<br/>
a set of poker candles, and the highest pair got a set of poker chips.<br/>
Others got poker sets, including the last person in, half an hour past the<br/>
deadline, Wanderlust and Tooth Fairy :) Everyone went home with either a<br/>
deck of cards or one of our personalized votive/shot glass. The<br/>
personalization said "Joker's Wild Letterbox Gathering, October 1st, 2005".<br/>
After prizes had been given out, the potluck commenced with a poker cake and<br/>
lots of good food. (I want the recipe for those potstickers!).<br/>
<br/>
I've posted some pictures at Atlasquest and hope that others that took<br/>
pictures will do so as well.<br/>
