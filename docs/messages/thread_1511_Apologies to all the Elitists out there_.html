                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay I've had it - I give in - I understand now - I surrender.  - So long<br/>
ago I spoke out against the elitist attitude, I felt we should embrace<br/>
newbies, I thought the secretiveness of letterboxing was over rated.  I give<br/>
now, I wave my white flag - I was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a matter of weeks I have heard of the following<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
People moving the debris of the boxes as a favor to the placer<br/>
<br/>
People altering the image in a box<br/>
<br/>
People relocating the boxes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8 of 12 of my California boxes have now been found within a week, out in the<br/>
open, boxes open, stamps gone<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I just got an email from a geocacher informing me they took my stamp<br/>
as a trinket and left toys in my box..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I get it - I understand - Its no wonder old time boxers were annoyed with a<br/>
new generation -<br/>
<br/>
It's getting worse and worse, more ridiculous and more ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I apologize to everyone I ever called an elitist and told to chill out - I<br/>
get it now. I would say you should have given me a clue - but I guess you<br/>
all did, I was just too busy following the ones for boxes!<br/>
