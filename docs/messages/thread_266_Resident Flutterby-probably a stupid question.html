I feel sheepish asking this, but are you certain that Resident Flutterfly is <br/>
in Multnomah County?  I had a big fat A-HA moment and was convinced I was onto <br/>
something...until I checked the county.  The resident flutterby I'm thinking <br/>
of is in Clackamas County.  Is there any chance you might have the county <br/>
wrong (I hope, with fingers crossed)--or is my big fat A-HA for naught??????<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
