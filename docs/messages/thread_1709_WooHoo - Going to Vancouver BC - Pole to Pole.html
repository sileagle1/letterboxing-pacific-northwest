I was going to post to the big board (LBusa) but thought I'd join PNW <br/>
to announce my soon to happen trip to the Candian Rockies.  And I was <br/>
looking at LB.org for boxes but not much within reach -- sooo glad to <br/>
see the Pole-2-Pole post.  I had already planned to plant a box in <br/>
Stanley Park in honor of my British friend Stanley -- how could I <br/>
pass that one by.<br/>
<br/>
Will need to review prior posts for any other boxes in the locations <br/>
where I will be going and if anyone wants to meet for an exchange or <br/>
to go boxing let me know - sowbiz @ yahoo . com<br/>

that I had booked before I learned about Letterboxing . . . so now it <br/>
will be even more enjoyable!<br/>
<br/>
I just came back from Dartmoor (Baker's Dozen - Yankees on the Moors) <br/>
and the Mansfield Monster Mash.  Folk's in the office are beginning <br/>
to think I have already retired . . . but I am just practicing for <br/>
next Apr 1 !!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet some LB'rs from PNW next month - 16 days!!  <br/>

&gt; We saw that there were no boxes listed for Stanley Park in <br/>
Vancouver,<br/>
&gt; and decided to remedy the situation. <br/>
