minor changes to the step counts and compass readings, but a little <br>
more help describing how to find your way around using those readings <br>
to *hopefully* make it easier following the clues.  =)<br>

Good luck!<br>

<br>
No way!  =)  I figured clues that are wrong deserve to be corrected, <br>
and there were a couple of "small" mistakes in my clues, so I <br>
corrected them.  The problem with THIS type of clue, though, is that <br>
what starts as a small mistake can quickly grow into a LARGE one!  =)<br>
<br>
And if it's any consolation, I think people will still end up <br>
throwing the clues away in frustration and just hunt around randomly <br>
in the hopes of finding it.  May or may not work, but THAT is <br>
certainly in the tradition of this box!  =)<br>
<br>
Carpe diem!<br>
