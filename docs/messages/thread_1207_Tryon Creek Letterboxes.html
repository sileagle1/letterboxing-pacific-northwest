I got the following note from Tryon Creek staff. Letterboxing is no <br>

I'm not sure how I was elected the lucky recipent of the message. In <br>
any case I've responded that the boxes aren't mine and that Der Mad <br>
Stamper is MIA. I also said I would ask if someone can volunteer to <br>
remove the boxes. Note that there are 5 boxes that I'm aware of, not <br>
just the two she noted. I think this would be a good idea as a lack <br>
of cooperation may lead to a more widespread ban in all State <br>
Parks/Areas. It looks like from the bottom of the email that they <br>
may be willing to work with us, a la THRPD. Perhaps the volunteer <br>

Message: <br>
Hello, my name is Karen Trombley and I am the park manager at Tryon <br>
Creek State<br>
Natural Area in Portland, Oregon.  <br>
It has come to my attention that you currently have as many as two <br>
letterboxes<br>
located in the park (Iron Mountain & High Bridge).  <br>
We recently went through a process with geocachers and have decided <br>
not to allow<br>
caches in the park.  The same would apply to letterboxes.  While we <br>
realize this is<br>
a fun activity, we also realize the potential damage that can occur <br>
to our natural<br>
resource.  This activity encourages off trail usage which can damage <br>
our fragile<br>
watershed and wipe out plants and animal habitat.  The most <br>
important point is<br>
safety.  Venturing off trail is dangerous to the person or persons <br>
seeking a<br>
letterbox.  Unstable ground, stinging plants, and ground nesting <br>
yellowjackets are<br>
just a few of the many reasons it can be a health hazard.<br>
Your cooperation in our effort to preserve our park and keep <br>
visitors safe will be<br>
welcome.  Please remove letterboxes from all location in the park <br>
asap and post on<br>
your website.<br>
Alternative solutions may be found if you are willing to explore <br>
them.  Please<br>
contact me if you wish to explore other options for your group.<br>
Again, thank you for your cooperation in this matter.  <br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Karen Trombley<br>

While you are doing your PR would you ask how they found out about <br>
the letterboxes ? Wendy Gault had one in the area also. Ryan may <br>
have info regarding her letterbox ? <br>

There's a link to her clue under Links on the left navigation bar of <br>
this website, under "Clues! Clues! Clues!", but that's all the <br>
information I have.  *shrug*<br>

 <br>
Mudstumpers will be glad to pick up all of the boxes, at least temporarily, since this is our bailiwick, but it would be awesome if Funhog, the diplomat, would try to negotiate with them. <br>
 <br>
 We did go out last night and we picked up High Bridge and Wendy's Orphan.  We ran into the 7PM curfew and out of daylight before we could get to the rest.  We were planning to pick them all up and hold them until a decision is made.  I hope we have not stepped on any toes.<br>
 <br>
Thanks<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yay!  Go Funhog, go!  I'm DEEELIGHTED that you volunteered to speak with the <br>
staff at Tryon.  This is the way to handle such situations, instead of LBers <br>
getting all huffy, upset, or nasty about the ordered removal of our boxes.  <br>
Talking is good.  You might not be able to convince them--but it's still the <br>
best response!  Maybe you can convince them to allow boxes subject to their <br>
approval of each location.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I have always been uncomfortable with the location of Der Mad <br>
Stamper's Red Fox Bridge--it requires seekers to go off the official trail, onto <br>
a "user" trail.  I don't see any way to successfully argue that this box <br>
should remain in its current location.  Hmm, Birdwatcher might also be considered <br>
off trail?  But (if memory serves) Wendy's Tryon Creek Orphan box, DMS's High <br>
Bridge and the Iron Mt box--as well as, ahem, a certain mystery box--are all <br>
within nabbing distance from an established/official trail.  <br>
<br>
Mudstumpers--consider leaving the remaining boxes in place for now--at least <br>
until Funhog has a chance to speak with the Tryon folks.  Maybe they would <br>
want her to show them where a box or two are located so that they can see how <br>
little these beside-the-trail boxes impact the environment.  Maybe following the <br>
clues and discovering the boxes (with the Hawg's kindly guidance) will spark a <br>
recognition of how freaking fun our little hobby is???<br>
