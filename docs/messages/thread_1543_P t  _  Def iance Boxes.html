                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got home from checking on my boxes in the park. Sad to say that <br>
the Amalgam Series has been decimated. Only one of the four boxes is <br>
still there. Funny thing is that that was probably the second most <br>
vulnerable box in the group. The third and fourth which were in my <br>
opinion the hardest to get are totally missing...no trace. The first <br>
box's hiding spot has been totally dug out all the way underneath <br>
the tree. I don't know if an animal dug it out or a human did.<br>
<br>
I have reconitierred the trail and have came up with some alternate <br>
locations. Hopefully I can get the boxes replaced this coming <br>
weekend.<br>
<br>
We checked on the Lost Mariner and he is not lost. There are also <br>
two types of "Bears" hidden in the park. The Polar one is missing <br>
again and the other one can't be reached via the route given in the <br>
clues due to fencing that has recently been installed. I will send a <br>
message to the placer and let him know.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, on the bright side we picked up the Moaning Myrtle HH at <br>
the Pt. Pa goda box. <br>
<br>
We checked the first of the Bowl boxes and it is confirmed missing. <br>
Of course it didn't help matters this afternoon when just as we were <br>
coming away from it's hiding spot we looked up and there was a parks <br>
person looking at us from his truck. He really gave us a dirty look <br>
since we actually had the dogs offleash (yes we know it is a no-no) <br>
and if he had followed us he would of found out that we were parked <br>
illegally too. Both CLEB and myself (and the dogs) ran back to the <br>
truck as fast as we could.<br>
