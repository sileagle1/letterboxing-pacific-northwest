Just go at it!  Nobody I know has ever made a great stamp right out <br>
of the starting gate, and you don't have to show anybody any stamps <br>
you don't want them to see!  =)<br>
<br>
Der Mad Stamper has an excellent tutorial for carving stamps at <br>
http://members.aol.com/Letterboxr/carving.html which is the primary <br>
place I learned how to carve.  After that, it was mostly just lots of <br>
practice!<br>
<br>
I created my own version of Carving 101 (minus this cute <br>
illistrations and used photos instead) which also shows some of the <br>
tools you might find useful.  That webpage is at <br>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/Carving<br>
<br>
The bottom of that webpage has links to other nice webpages related <br>
to carving.  Read, practice, and learn!  =)<br>

When I decided to try my (shaky) hand on my first stamp, I borrowed my wife's tools and pink stuff, sketched out a picture and words, transferred it, and started carving.  Making the first test stamp, I thought "Most certainly I can do better than this".  The following night, I made another sketch (same topic) and tried again.  When I made the first test stamp, I thought "I guess I can't do any better!"  Not that it was perfect, but that I couldn't do better.<br>
<br>
The encouraging news is that I am getting better.  With time and practice, my technique is improving and am trying more intricate designs.  Still nowhere close to the ultimate skill of His Eminence, but improving.<br>

  My personal stamp sucks.  Yes, I committed the near mortal sin of <br>
  store-bought, and machine made! *gasp*  I really wanted to just get <br>
  in to letterboxing as soon as possible, and yet still have something <br>
  kind of personal to leave behind.  I really am terrified that if I <br>
  try and make a stamp of my own though that I'll turn out some horrid <br>
  mess.  I'm afraid I'm not very artistic, but now I realize I need <br>

We just bought the cheap speedy cut block and used an exacto knife for our stamp.  I went through about a half a block until I got the hang of it.<br>
A couple of days ago we went to Michael's and picked up the nifty little pack of tools  but we have not had the time to try them out.<br>
