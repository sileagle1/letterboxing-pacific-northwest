Oregon is not finding positive animals, vectors or sentinels as of <br/>
yet.  Hard to believe they would intentionally drain a pond.<br/>

Drought?<br/>

A little rain would be nice about now, We could use it up here.<br/>

Hi Carie &amp; Hoopoe,<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago I chatted with one of the people who works there &amp; she said <br/>
the ponds naturally drain this time of year (one pond has a small spring, so <br/>
that one continues to be at least mucky thru out the year).  When the ELC was <br/>
privately managed, they used to pump in city water--so the ponds were full year <br/>
round.  Now they intend to let the one non-artisian-supplied pond become an <br/>
emergent wetland.  Some ducks are still there--others probably took off for a <br/>
wetter place.  Now there are 4 chickens as well-- some yahoo let them loose <br/>
there.  If anybody wants 'em, the staff would be happy to see them go!<br/>
