box today and it is now located in another spot near there, <br/>
hopefully a bit more protected than the last but you still get the <br/>
nice downtown stroll.  This is much faster than I expected and <br/>
hopefully it will last a little longer this time!<br/>

&gt; I just wanted to let you all know that the new JeLo series in Mt <br/>
&gt; Vernon, WA has been compromised.  Box #1, jiggler, was found with <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; NEEDLE in it and a note mentioning drugs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am so very disappointed as these are my first boxes and it <br/>
happened <br/>
&gt; so soon.  Is this a common occurance?  Are there many other <br/>
stories <br/>
&gt; like this?  I didnt ever think that even in little ol' Mt Vernon <br/>
&gt; something like this would happen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have moved away from the area and although I have someone who is <br/>
&gt; going to retrieve it tomorrow, I wont be able to find a new hiding <br/>
&gt; spot very easily.  If anyone wants to go ahead and try for the <br/>
bonus <br/>
&gt; box, feel free to message me and I will send you the missing clues <br/>
&gt; from jiggler.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any advice or stories,<br/>
