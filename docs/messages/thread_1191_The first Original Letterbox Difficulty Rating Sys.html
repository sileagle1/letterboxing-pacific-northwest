<br/>
The first original Letterbox Difficulty Rating System is now up and running at The National Letterbox Consortium Website. I invite everyone to take a look at it and let me know what you think and what else you'd like to see on it.<br/>
<br/>
In a brief synopsis, it uses a code, much like the PFX count. I call it the LbRS count and it looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
M1 T2 L3 A4 C5 D1 H0 S1<br/>
<br/>
It's very easy, once you get the hang of it.  <br/>
<br/>
"M" stands for "Modifier" in other word's, how that person (The one that entered the LB Rating) rates themselves as a hiker in a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the worst, 5 being the best.<br/>
"T" stands for the Terrain in a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the easiest, 5 being the hardest.<br/>
"L" stands for the Location in a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the easiest, 5 being the hardest.<br/>
"A"stands for the Accessibility in a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the easiest, 5 being the hardest.<br/>
"C" stands for the Clues in a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the easiest, 5 being the hardest.<br/>
"D" stands for Dog friendly with a 1 meaning yes and a 0 meaning no.<br/>
"H" stands for Handicap friendly with a 1 meaning yes and a 0 meaning no.<br/>
"S" stands for Stroller friendly with a 1 meaning yes and a 0 meaning no.<br/>
<br/>
It resides at http://www.myndworx.com/modules/lcas/diff_gen.php and is mean to run from inside the NLC Database system, however, if you wish, you can use the form to generate the code for your letterboxes and use it elsewhere.  I think this will make it easier for all concerned if this format is used as it resembles the current format for PFX counts and it is easily understandable.  It doesn't leave much to the imagination and the Modifier tells you that the hike that person rated as easy, may be a bit more than easy for you if you are a novice.  It doesn't give anything away about the letterbox, it just helps you make an informed decision about whether or not you want to try for that letterbox.<br/>
