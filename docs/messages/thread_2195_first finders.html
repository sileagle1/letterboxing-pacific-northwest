I love finding a box that's been well visited because I like looking at all the stamps and reading the notes...but if I'm the first, or one of them, it's kind of neat to find some other perk since I can't read a fun log!<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to mull it over a little. It can work for you or against you I guess.<br/>

I have never tried to get a first finder, but run into it twice. Both<br/>
times the person had written up a little first finder certificate. I<br/>
glued it into my logbook. It makes the most sense to me!<br/>
