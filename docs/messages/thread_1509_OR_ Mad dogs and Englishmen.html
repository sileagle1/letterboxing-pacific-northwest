Seemed like just the perfect time to head for McIver Park to check up on some <br/>
Traveling Circus boxes. I'm pleased to report the following are all A-OK:<br/>
Sunburst, Mini Cooper, MI(LO) or Bust and Royal Angler. Since I was already in the <br/>
neighborhood, I also checked on First Time's a Charm, Milo McIver Campout and <br/>
Special Delivery. <br/>
<br/>
All but Brett's adorable Special D were doing fine. Unfortunately, someone decided <br/>
that they wanted the log and stamp but left the container in its hiding place. My <br/>
apologies to She Bear and Wild Woman for failing to check on their boxes too. After a <br/>
couple of hours of hiking around and guzzling almost three liters of water, I called it <br/>
quits. It was a veritable Pig Roast out there! Funhog<br/>
