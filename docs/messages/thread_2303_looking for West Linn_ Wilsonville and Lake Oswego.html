need to talk with people in these cities. If you're out there with <br/>
some tales to share please contact me, Holly Carpenter, at <br/>
holly@stuftdzine.com  or call 503-348-8272. You can also simply reply <br/>
to this post and my husband Scott - who's been kind enough to let me <br/>
steal some bandwith in his name - will forward it to me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
I look forward to swaping stories,<br/>
