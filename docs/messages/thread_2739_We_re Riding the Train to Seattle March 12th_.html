This is our Homeschool field trip and we are hoping there are some  <br/>
boxes we could find within striking range (via foot or bus/trolley/?)  <br/>
of the train station. I see the Walking Tour which might work if we  <br/>
have enough time. We arrive at 12:15 pm and have to be back to the  <br/>
station at 5 pm. Anybody know if we could do this in time with 2 nine  <br/>
year olds in tow or would it be wiser to just go to the Aquarium or  <br/>
Science Center? If you know of some shorter boxes we could combine  <br/>
with  the Aq. or SC please share!<br/>
Thanks in advance for any suggestions, pointers, hints!<br/>

We did the Walking Tour in about 6 hours with two young children in <br/>
tow--knowing the area really well (as it was smack dab in the middle <br/>
of my commute route) and even cheating on a few 'legs' along the <br/>
way.  Even then we still needed a second trip to the area to actually <br/>
retrieve the box so I'd recommend doing something else during your <br/>
limited time in the area.  Nothing's more frustrating than spending <br/>
hours 'solving' a box and then not having the time to actually <br/>
retrieve it!<br/>
<br/>
Pacific Science Center is awesome, the Aquarium was unique but I'm <br/>
not sure if they've completed their total renovations by this time.  <br/>
Another thing that few people know about but is really cool is the <br/>
Discovery Maritime Museum on the Waterfront--adjacent to the Aquarium <br/>
and well within walking distance of Pike Place Market.  It offers <br/>
lots of hands on type activities for the kids--all related to <br/>
maritime activities ranging from Coast Guard, Navy, maritime <br/>
shipping, fishing, cruise ships, sea kayaks, etc--if it involves a <br/>
boat of any kind they probably talk about it there.  It was really <br/>
interesting and in such a unique location because it offers great <br/>
views of Elliot Bay and you can listen in on the actual maritime <br/>
traffic as the ships come into port or enter the shipping lanes.  <br/>
Very unique and educational--ideal for homeschoolers and a great <br/>
mental connection for Seattle especially tying that in with the route <br/>
that Amtrak follows along Puget Sound from Portland to Seattle!  <br/>
<br/>
As for letterboxes, not sure if there are any in the immediate <br/>
vicinity of those areas these days.  There had been a couple at <br/>
Seattle Center for a while but if I'm not mistaken they either went <br/>
missing recently or were pulled not too long ago.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how different Pacific Science Center is from OMSI, <br/>
though.  OMSI seemed to focus on a lot of biology and mechanical type <br/>
things whereas Pacific Science Center has a dinosaur display, <br/>
insects, hands on science experiments (quite similar to OMSI's--sound <br/>
waves, physics, weather forecasting, and a focus on Puget Sound tides <br/>
and the potential devastating effects of lahars/volcanic eruptions, <br/>
etc) and rotating displays (when we were last there they had a big <br/>
display on candy and how the body digests food).  If you want <br/>
something unique to Seattle, go to the Maritime Museum instead.  If <br/>
the aquarium is open, you could probably do both at the same time and <br/>
still make it back to your train.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

The walking tour one is a little involved. I think that honestly you'd<br/>
have more fun, given your limited time, if you did the Aquarium /<br/>
Maritime Museum.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to take a walk through Pike Place Market while you're<br/>
in the area - sometimes they have tours that tell you about the<br/>
history of the Market but I don't know what the schedule is for those.<br/>
The donut-making machine at the donut place near the newsstand (follow<br/>
your nose) is popular with my kids, and there's a cheese place on the<br/>
corner (Beecher's) that you can see how they make the cheese through a<br/>
big glass window.<br/>
<br/>
The Alaska Gold Rush museum is also fun (and free!)- that's between<br/>
the train station and the Aquarium, if I remember right. Trolleys are<br/>
not running now I don't think, so don't count on it, but the busses<br/>
are free in that area. It's not that far of a walk, but I know little<br/>
feet get tired sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I'm actually planning to do a box in that area, as soon as I figure<br/>
out how to plant it - tupperware under a bush is not going to last<br/>
downtown ;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ditto the Underground Tour - it's just the kind of thing kids would like,<br/>
I think, as long as they don't have any touches of claustrophobia or<br/>
whatever.<br/>
http://www.seattletravel.com/seattleundergroundtour.html<br/>
<br/>
Near the Underground Tour starting location is the Klondike Gold Rush<br/>
(Inter)National Historical Park Seattle unit museum - it's free, and has<br/>
GREAT history and info displays and short movies. http://www.nps.gov/klse/<br/>
<br/>
Both are easy walking distance from the train station, the summer I<br/>
volunteered at Klondike I walked over to the train station a couple times<br/>
to replenish the station's brochure supply.<br/>
<br/>
Downtown Seattle has the 'ride free' zone for the buses which is great for<br/>
getting around that area, going clear from the train station to the<br/>
Market, for example, is a long walk. :)<br/>

(there's also a link on that page to a downtown Seattle guide and map<br/>
that's pretty useful)<br/>
<br/>
-patch<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can't help with boxes in the area, but wanted to also recommend the<br/>
&gt; Maritime Museum. Never crowded at all. Another fun thing to do that's very<br/>
&gt; close to the train station is the Undgerground Tour. I think it takes<br/>
&gt; about an hour? So, it's pretty quick.<br/>
