                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bright ideas?  Hmmm...  How about a letterboxing marathon?  =)  A series of boxes--perhaps three or four--that people can 'race' (one at a time) the course while being timed.  Kind of a 'letterbox-athalon'.  And give out prizes to the fastest athlet (2nd and 3rd place prizes too!).  The biggest loser award could be fun too. =)  <br>
You could hold the 'event' on Saturday or Sunday afternoon depending on which day most people can show up for it.<br>
<br>
Oh, the master carver Paisley Orca could give free carving semanars to anyone that wants them too. =)<br>
<br>
That's all I can think of off the top of my head.<br>
