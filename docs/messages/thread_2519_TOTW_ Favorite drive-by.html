our favorites.  We enjoyed it especially as a storm was coming in and <br>
the cloud formations around the gorgeous area were especially <br>
breathtaking!<br>
<br>
There are many, many other dirve-bys that we enjoyed--one overlooking <br>
the Marin Headlands in Northern California comes to the top of my mind, <br>
too--mostly for its spectacular view.<br>
