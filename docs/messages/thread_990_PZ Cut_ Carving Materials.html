<br/>
I use all kinds of carving material.  PZ Cut is wonderful for getting<br/>
great detail, though I've found sometimes it doesn't take the ink very<br/>
well.  Sometimes it needs to scotchbrited or sanded to give the material<br/>
some tooth to adequately take the ink.  It is thin.  Sometimes I mount<br/>
it and sometimes I don't.  I really like low-maintenance materials.<br/>
<br/>
I use the "Pink Stuff" called Speedy  Stamp, I believe, as well.  It's<br/>
pretty good.  A bit floppy, but nice to carve on, too.  It gets pretty<br/>
good detail.  I've only found it at Michael's and only after a real<br/>
search on my own.  You'll get no help from the hired staff there.  For<br/>
that reason I detest shopping there and avoid it like the plague.  If<br/>
there is another source for Speedy Stamp I'd rather go there.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I tend to use Nasco Saf T Kut.  Many people find it to be crumbly<br/>
and difficult to get detail with.  I tend to carve bold images, for the<br/>
most part, and since it was one of the first materials I started carving<br/>
on way back in the early 90's I'm very comfortable with it.  It's also<br/>
thicker than either PZ Cut or Speedy Stamp and it is more economical.<br/>
It costs less than $2 for a 4 x 6 sheet at Art Media in Portland.  <br/>
<br/>
MarsCarve or Master Carve are wonderful mediums.  Delightful to carve<br/>
with.  They get good detail and are very thick.  They are also pretty<br/>
expensive, so, while I do carve with it at times and have some stock of<br/>
it at home, I rarely use it.  Just for special occasions, I guess.<br/>
Whatever that means.<br/>
<br/>
A tried and true inexpensive material that is also good is Dollar Tree<br/>
erasers.  Sometimes you can get them in packs of one large and three<br/>
small erasers.  AND...at only a buck per pkg!  I know these are good and<br/>
work well and are cheap, cheap, cheap.  I think The Fleshman's<br/>
One-Eyed-Willie stamp was carved with this material, if I'm not<br/>
mistaken.  If so, then great detail can be had on this medium, as well.<br/>
The large eraser is very thick.<br/>
<br/>
I have also tried Plumbers Gasket, but don't care for it much.  It is<br/>
easy to get (Home Depot or hardware stores carry it).  It's inexpensive<br/>
to buy by a large sheet.  It is high-maintenance to me, though.  It's<br/>
tough to carve (more like linoleum without the backing) and it always<br/>
has to be sanded to be able to take the ink well.  Mounting isn't<br/>
necessary, but the material is way thin.  Like, much thinner than PZ<br/>
Cut, even.  It is best used with very sharp tools.<br/>
<br/>
That is my low down on most of the stuff I have used.  Each material<br/>
holds different esteem and quality in my eyes.  It depends on the<br/>
purpose, my mood, supply and circumstances which material I will use for<br/>
what.  It's great to try all kinds of different carving medium to get<br/>
you  used to it so you can carve on anything in a pinch.  Preferences<br/>
are nice, but if you get too used to one type of material it's easy to<br/>
get stuck on it and not be able to carve well on anything else, or just<br/>
be disappointed when your carve doesn't turn out like you want because<br/>
you really want to be using something else.<br/>
<br/>
There you have it.  I don't claim to be an expert or an outstanding<br/>
carver, but I do have years of carving experience and plenty of<br/>
opinions!  Take it as you may.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Thankfully someone else has said what I have hated for a while. <br/>
Although the medium is has a good density for carving, the ink <br/>
application of it really sucks. I usually use Crayola Watercolor <br/>
Markers to ink stamps in various colors. When I tried that with PZ Cut, <br/>
I had a runny watercolor disaster. To conteract that I have learned to <br/>
carry at least one inkpad. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing my fate enough to tell others!<br/>

PS-Plumbers Gasket??? Is anyone ever so desperate to carve that they <br/>
can't find an arts/crafts store? <br/>
