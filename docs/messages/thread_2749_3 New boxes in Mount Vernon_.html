                    <div class="plaintext-content">Attention PNW Boxers!  There are now 3 new boxes planted in Mount <br>
Vernon, WA!  The JeLo series includes 2 boxes both hidden no more than <br>
10 minutes from I5 and a 3rd Bonus Box (you will need to find the <br>
first two to complete the clue) will be planted Sunday in a location <br>
yet to be determined.<br>
<br>
This is my first plant, (excluding my very first a year ago in <br>
Guatemala) and it is also a collaborative effort with my mother who is <br>
slowly getting turned on to the wonderful world that is <br>
LetterBoxing ;).  I hope it's a nice stop when driving between Seattle <br>
and Bellingham and as a reminder - the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival is <br>
coming up in April and it would be a great time to visit!<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about the directions or the area, please <br>
feel free to message me via yahoo or atlasquest!<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting!<br>
