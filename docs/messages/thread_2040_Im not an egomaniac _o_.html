in Bandon, OR named "Erfellie". Sound familiar? Well this was placed <br/>
unbeknownst to me by my wonderful sister who goes by "awildflower". I <br/>
just wanted to let you all know I am not naming letterboxes after <br/>
myself haha. I am very curious to go find this one, I wonder what she <br/>
could have possibly carved and why in the world she would name it after <br/>
me... It must be me, since there are no other Erfellie's that I have <br/>
ever met in my whole life, unless I travel to Israel and then I might <br/>
find some Erfellies there, but not here in the states... hmmm..<br/>
Oh! and Happy Mothers day!!<br/>
Erfellie :)<br/>
