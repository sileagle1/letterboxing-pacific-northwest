Attention one and all!!! Pierce County Rescue as an emergency on their hands and they are overrun with calls, can you help?  Thunder Jack and Ted from the Disney Movie "Snow Dogs" have lost control of their vehicle while enroute to the Puyallup fair and they, along with their dogs, have become lost in the Bresemann Forest near the Sprinker Recreation Center.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are posted at the main LbNa site as well as at:<br/>
