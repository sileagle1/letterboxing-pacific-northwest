<br/>
So first day back went to Lewis County, on the way back stopped to find the Lost Locomotive.  By the way, it is a County park; Ham Hilpert, the District One Commissioner on the commemorative plaque, is a nice gentleman I play bridge with.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I followed the clues, found the stump, figured out the location, and got the box!  It is great to be back at it after six weeks.  Found that my balance and coordination are not what they used to be, after doing nothing for that long.  Went thru the opening in the fence, spotted the log (power pole?) lying beside the tracks, went to sit on it to log on.  Heard the warning bell at the RXR, didn't want to find another locomotive, so got up and ran back to the fence.  Didn't want to be seen trespassing by the second Lost Locomotive.  <br/>
<br/>
 All was fine, nice stamp, nice park.<br/>
