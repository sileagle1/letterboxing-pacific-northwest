the whole fam-damnly-be at the event on Saturday! He'll be debuting <br>
his new signature stamp carved by yours truly. It's very artistic if <br>
you don't read Korean, if you do, its just a word. Mark isn't <br>
really "in" to lbing, so more likely he'll entertain the kiddos while <br>
I exchange stamps.<br>
<br>
SO excited to be going!<br>
<br>
And Fudrick-sorry you can't go, we'll miss your "famous" little dog!<br>
(And you of course)<br>
