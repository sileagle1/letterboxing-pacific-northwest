<br>
Hi--for anybody out there who is interested in joining us, a few <br>
letterboxers from the region will get together from 2-4 pm (may last <br>
longer if the kids want to play for a while) on 31 July 04 at <br>
Brown's Point Park (Lighthouse), WAY-WAY North Tacoma (practically <br>
Federal Way at this point) to meet with Spacy Holly and her <br>
letterboxing family from Southern California for exchanges.  <br>
<br>
We plan on meeting at the flag pole in front of (West) of the <br>
lighthouse keepers cottage.  The park offers expansive and <br>
incredible views of the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound, Vashon & <br>
Maury Islands, and depending on the tides lots of opportunity for <br>
beachcombing and boulder scrambling.  There's even <br>
enough 'greenspace' to throw a football or frisbee.  We plan on <br>
bringing some picnic items, too.<br>
<br>
Let us know if you plan on joining us then.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we'll see you there?<br>
