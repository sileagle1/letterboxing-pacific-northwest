                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello PNWers,<br>
Gwen & I are heading north on 7/7 to nab a few of your boxes. One stop <br>
will be in the Salem area Wednesday, July 20 through Monday, July <br>
25th. Some of my day time will be tied up with the Oregon State shoot, <br>
but if anyone wants to get together for an evening BBQ or pizza let us <br>
know. Gwen will be looking for any daytime diversions. We will be <br>
continuing north into Washington, but exact dates haven't been figured <br>
out yet. We would have loved to join you at the Silver Falls Gathering <br>
or the Float Your Boat, but there was no way to figure either of those <br>
in. You can contact us directly or through this list.<br>
