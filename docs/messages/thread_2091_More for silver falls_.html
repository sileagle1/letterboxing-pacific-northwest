<br>
This is my first post (I tried another last night, didn't seem to<br>
go?) Anyways, we've been letterboxers for a year and a-half now. I've <br>
introduced it to several friends and they don't seem to have caught <br>
the bug as strong as I, why?  So it is high time to meet some other <br>
crazy people.  I'm thinking that we (Fun Gal, Handyman and Ginky)<br>
will come for the festivities on Sat.  Is that when there will be<br>
exchanges and potluck?  Where can we find the group?<br>
<br>
I'm very excited to meet some of the hiders and creators of the <br>
wonderful boxes we've been collecting stamps from!!<br>
