Thank you all for coming to this event. I had a wonderful time. I <br/>
think my knees and ankles are being to feel a little normal after <br/>
that EASY walk around Battle Ground Lake. (I'm not whinning!) It was <br/>
indeed a pleasure to meet everyone and see how LBing is done in the <br/>
PNW. I hope to meet you all again sometime and if you are ever in my <br/>
neck of the woods (not that we have any down here) please be sure and <br/>
stop by to say HI. Purple Iris <br/>

to it.  But, as we all know, the best laid plans of men and mice.  Kris and I are unable to get more than 30 minutes <br/>
away from home at any given time right now, considering the condition my father is in.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps one day, you'll get back here or we'll get out there and we'll get a chance to exchange and meet.<br/>
