                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since at least a couple of people have expressed an interest in a <br>
Pacific Northwest letterboxing board, I've taken it upon myself to <br>
create one.  There are some changes I've made from the main <br>
letterboxing group, which I'll outline below so you know what to <br>
expect.<br>
<br>
First, I've set it up so you cannot include attachments to your <br>
posts.  If you have files or photos, there is a seperate section for <br>
them (under 'Files' and 'Photos' to the left) where up can upload <br>
such stuff and refer to them if necessary.  I've disallowed <br>
attachments to reduce the chance of someone spreading viruses <br>
inadvertantly.  It'll also help reduce the clogging of the mailboxes <br>
for people that preper to receive their posts that way.  And with the <br>
files and photos sections, it's just not necessary.<br>
<br>
The 'Links' section I've set up so only moderators can change them <br>
(which, at this point, only inclues myself).  If you want to add, <br>
change, or delete a link, e-mail me and I'll get right on it.  If you <br>
look at the links section for the LbNA group, it's choked full <br>
of "junk links" and I don't want that happening to this one.  I want <br>
it to be a useful, organized place that people can visit to find <br>
information about letterboxing in general as well as links geared <br>
towards the Pacific Northwest.  They don't even have to be <br>
letterboxing links per se, but rather anything a Pacific Northwest <br>
letterboxer might find useful from orienteering events in Oregon to <br>
hiking trails in Vancouver.<br>
<br>
I've already included websites I know of for local letterboxers.  If <br>
I'm missing any, please let me know!  (Actually, I know I'm missing <br>
Bethany's and Bill's websites, but I don't know the links for them!)<br>
<br>
I've removed a couple of miscellaneous options like the chat and <br>
database features because, well, I've never heard of anyone actually <br>
using them.  If you REALLY want to chat with someone, you can always <br>
go to the main letterboxing board to do that, I suppose.  If for some <br>
reason you actually do find a really useful purpose for those <br>
features, let me know and I'll put them back.<br>
<br>
Over the next couple of weeks I'll probably be playing with the <br>
colors before I settle down on a final color scheme.  I don't know <br>
about you, but I'm kind of board of the same color scheme for YEARS <br>
that has persisted on the main letterboxing group, and I'd like <br>
something at least a little different here for a change of pace.  In <br>
the meantime, expect bizarre colors to show up suddenly and <br>
unexpectedly for brief periods of time.  =)<br>
<br>
And finally, I won't be able to keep an eye on this board myself all <br>
the time, and I'm looking for a couple of people who might want to be <br>
moderators on this board.  Most of the time that probably won't <br>
require any work at all, but at least someone should be around to <br>
keep an eye on things while I'm hiking the Appalachian Trail or <br>
otherwise indisposed.  If you're interested, let me know!<br>
<br>
And, that's about all I can think of for now.  As I put in the <br>
description, clues for new boxes or changes to old ones should be <br>
posted to the main letterboxing website if you want them to show up <br>
on the LbNA website since the webmasters there may not be patrolling <br>
this board.  You can post them here as well, though, if you want to <br>
make sure they stand out from the hundreds of posts made to the other <br>
board, though.  =)<br>
<br>
Okay, that's the last of my long, legalise-kindof-speak.  Take off <br>
your shoes and make yourselves at home.  =)<br>

Carpe diem!<br>

We have our first letterbox at<br>
<br>
http://www.speakeasy.org/~dbltall/<br>
<br>
We plan to add others to this site as we get them carved and <br>
hidden.<br>
<br>
If there are any Seattle people who want to take a look at our <br>
maiden effort, please let me know how the clues are (too hard, <br>
too easy, or confusing in any way), and if anything needs <br>
improvement.<br>
<br>

That really sucks.   I had my father build a huge tack box with locks. They would have to make a lot of noise to get in to it and taking the whole box would take a moving van.  Good luck!<br>

Ooh. I can sympathize with ya on that. I had my saddle stolen out of my house about a year ago. At least it was fully covered on insurance and I was able to have another one custom made almost the same as my other one. I really hope that it still turns up somewhere someday, though.<br>
