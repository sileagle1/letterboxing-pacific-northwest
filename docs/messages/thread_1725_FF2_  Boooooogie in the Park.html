everyone that showed up.  We had such a wonderful time.  The kids had <br>
their own letterbox "Harry's Halloween at Hogwart's" to find with <br>
special clues written just for kids.  All in all approx 20 kids were <br>
able to complete and successfully locate that letterbox.  Now, Harry's <br>
Halloween at Hogwart's has become Hogwarts Hitchhiker Hostel, <br>
permanently placed at Millersylvania State Park.<br>

I'd like to thank everyone that came and made this a wonderful time for <br>
all. To all of the new people that showed up, and there were a lot of <br>
you folks, I'm thrilled to see such  enthusiastic people, that's what <br>
this hobby needs more of!  Thanks you for choosing this event as your <br>
first one to attend and we look forward to seeing you on the trails in <br>
the future.<br>
<br>
In no particular order, I'd like to thank the The Nailheads,  Fudrick, <br>
CampFireLady, Maiden and Tarnished Knight, Bookworm, Iron`Bear & <br>
Pandora,  DerMadStamper,  dvn2r ckr, Ole Vet, Jenn and Pupp,  and <br>
everyone else that also attended (If I forgot your name, please do not <br>
take it as a slight, I just plain forgot and I apologize.) I can't thank <br>
you enough for coming and partying with us, this is the entire reason <br>
that we host these gatherings, to meet new friends and to see old ones <br>
again,<br>
<br>
To Ryan and Amanda, I'm sorry you didn't have time to come over and say <br>
hi, I would have really enjoyed talking with you,<br>
<br>
To everyone that helped bring this together, I can not thank you enough.<br>
Iron`Bear and Pandora, you guys are the greatest friends and the most <br>
incredible co-host I have ever had and I can not thank you enough for <br>
helping.<br>
Maiden, everything you and RayvenMom did will make the kids remember <br>
this event like no other.<br>
CampFireLady, If I had to catch cooties, I'd rather catch them from no <br>
one but you!<br>
<br>
To anyone else who helped or attended and I missed you, thank you for <br>
everything and I'm sorry I forgot to mention you specifically.  <br>
RayvenMom and I had such a wonderful time!<br>
