the directions to Battle Ground Lake found on the link so I will give <br/>
you the path you need to travel to get to the Passport To <br/>
Letterboxing Stamp Camp at Battle Ground Lake. Please take note of <br/>
this message before you head out to the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I-5 freeway, off at exit 9/179th St.,<br/>
 if you are coming from the north, pass under the freeway and make a <br/>
left on NE 10th Ave./SR 502.<br/>
if you are coming from the south, go straight through the light at <br/>
the end of the off ramp onto NE 10th Ave./SR 502.<br/>
Travel 2 miles to NE 219th St/SR 502 and turn right, travel approx. <br/>
10 miles (NE 219th will turn into Main St. when you get into Battle <br/>
Ground) and turn left on Grace Ave., right at NE 229th St./Weisson <br/>
Rd., right onto Palmer Rd. to Battle Ground Lake State Park and turn <br/>
left into the park.<br/>
 There will be red  signs with red, blue and green balloons directing <br/>
you from the freeway to the park so keep an eye out for them. See you <br/>
there!<br/>

PASSPORT TO LETTERBOXING STAMP CAMP<br/>
<br/>
When: August 27-29, 2004<br/>
Where: Battle Ground Lake State Park, Battle Ground, WA.<br/>
<br/>
   Come out and spend a weekend camping or come for the day on <br/>
Saturday. There will be workshops on Letterboxing 101, Stamp Carving, <br/>
Book Binding, Jr. Ranger Program and Camp Crafts for the kids as well <br/>
as many letterboxes in the area to find! Visit <br/>
http://www.parks.wa.gov for information on campsites, directions to <br/>

there. <br/>
   Each person attending will be given a Passport that will include <br/>
pages for your personal stamp and information, a map of the park, <br/>
clues to letterboxes in Battle Ground Lake Park only (you will need <br/>
to bring the clues for letterboxes at Lewisville Park and Yacolt if <br/>
you plan on searching for them while at the Stamp Camp), a complete <br/>
schedule of events and pages for the images of the MANY event stamps <br/>
and letterboxes that you will find at the park. This passport will <br/>
also make a great keepsake after the event.<br/>
   There will be some awesome letterbox items raffled off at the <br/>
event. Raffle tickets are $1.00 each or 6 for $5.00. Kid's raffle <br/>
will be free.<br/>
   When you arrive, everyone including the kids will need to "check <br/>
in" at the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp check in table located <br/>
at campsite # 14 to receive your passport and information about the <br/>
event.  If you are attending on Saturday only please arrive any time <br/>
between 6:30 am and 9:00 am to check in and be there in time for the <br/>
first workshop.<br/>
   Please bring your carving tools if you have them, starter kits <br/>
will be available for $5.00 each if you would like to purchase them <br/>
at the event, a hitch hiker if you would like to participate in the <br/>
Hitch Hiker Hostel hidden in the park, your own firewood if you will <br/>
be camping (the park does not provide firewood), your own meals since <br/>
this will not be a potluck event, your letterboxing supplies and <br/>
plenty of cash for the raffles and the day use fee of $5.00 if you <br/>
are not camping out. Please do not bring extra letterboxes or hitch <br/>
hikers to leave on the tables. <br/>
   Your hosts for this event will be Camp Fire Lady, Iron Bear and <br/>
Pandora, Maiden and Bookworm.<br/>
   Look for the red, blue and green balloons that will direct you <br/>
into the park from the I-5 freeway and we will see you there at the <br/>
Passport To Letterboxing Stamp Camp at Battle Ground Lake State Park, <br/>
Battle Ground, WA.<br/>
Please R.S.V.P. to Camp Fire Lady at tinarie at msn dot com if you <br/>
plan on attending this event so that we can make sure that we have <br/>
enough supplies for everyone.<br/>
