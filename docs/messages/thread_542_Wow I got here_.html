<br>
Thank you to all of those on the list that emailed me privately with <br>
the link to join this group. I'm delighted to be a part of the <br>
Northwest Group and really glad I moved her considering all the great <br>
boxes that seem to be in the area -- I will be busy for ages I just <br>
know it.<br>
<br>
I can't wait to get a little more involved with local letterboxing <br>
and see what I can do to add to the seraching fun for everyone <br>
around.  I have a 15 stamp "Childrens Song" series that is just <br>
waiting for me to start finding the right places to begin planting.<br>
<br>
Thanks again and I hope to get to know all of you better.<br>
