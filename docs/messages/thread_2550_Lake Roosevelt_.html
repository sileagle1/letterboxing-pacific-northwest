  How about you plant your first box up there???<br/>

I'm not familiar with any boxes in the Lake Roosevelt Natl Rec Area <br/>
either.  If you do decide to plant something in that region, though, I <br/>
highly recommend that you do NOT plant anything around (remotely even <br/>
close to) the Grand Coulee Dam as it could and more likely would be <br/>
considered a security threat and treated as such.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are a few boxes in/around Wenatchee (relatively close by <br/>
if it's along your route--ok so it's in a neighboring grid square on <br/>
the map but it's closer than where most folks live in the state) and a <br/>
few more (if they're still active) in Lake Chelan further north.  <br/>
Otherwise,  the letterbox choices in the area are slim pickins...<br/>

Feel free to ask questions here when you can't find the answers <br/>

<br/>
And, most importantly, WELCOME TO LETTERBOXING!  It's amazing how <br/>
obsessed we all get with finding one more piece of carved rubber out <br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
It's a fun hobby and a great group of people and I hope you enjoy it <br/>
thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the trail sometime!<br/>
