people we don't know talking about a hobby he isn't into would be <br/>
fun, so we missed the Camp out, but we'll definatley be there the <br/>
9th! <br/>
<br/>
We used to live in Olympia and love that park, and we haven't got the <br/>
boxes there yet, either. Maybe if I'm really with it I'll have our <br/>
new stamps carved by then, right now we have a really cheesy store <br/>
bought one. That someone else also has, I ran across it in a logbook-<br/>
DOH!<br/>
<br/>
Count the strgzrmommafamily in- 4 of us, and maybe a visitor from out <br/>
of town if we can get her hooked by then!Also I'll hit up my next <br/>
door nieghbors who I introduced to LBing, they have been hitting some <br/>
of the local boxes and might be interested.<br/>
