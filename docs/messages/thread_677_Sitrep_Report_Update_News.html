Just wanted to take a moment and announce that Team Rayvenhaus hit F100 today.  WE made an early day and headed off to grab the last few we needed to break the 100 mark and we did... We're pretty beat so the stories will have to come later. WE were up and put the door before first light today and just now returned home.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, here we are, at F101 and all within 2 months!  That's right, we started on Aug 7th, 2003 and we broke 100 on Sept 6th, 2003!!!<br/>
<br/>
Gawd, I love this hobby!!!!!<br/>

&gt; Anyways, here we are, at F101 and all within 2 months!  That's right, we<br/>
started on Aug 7th, 2003 and we broke 100 on Sept 6th, 2003!!!<br/>

<br/>
Once again, it's up to me, RayvenMom to set the story straight as it's<br/>
obvious that the lack of sleep impeding Steve's brain has finally taken it's<br/>
toll on his ability to gauge actual time...<br/>
<br/>
2 months - that much is true...  However, our first stamp was found on JULY<br/>
7th (not August 7th as he seems to think)..<br/>
<br/>
But for now, that's it for my story-telling... the bed is calling my name<br/>
pretty loudly for a well deserved nap!!!<br/>
<br/>
Good night!<br/>
