<br>
1. I told Ryan no such thing, at anytime -- he is merely trying to get back<br>
at me for the "Turtle Soup" letterbox and well this was a good way to do it.<br>
Very clever Ryan!<br>

3. I havent been posting because my life has been hectic... and in that<br>
Iron`Bear and I have had to take a break, although be it temporary from<br>
letterboxing.  Iron`Bear decided we should get married, I thought it was a<br>
grand idea, so we chose to do it on Christmas Eve of this year, I am sure<br>
you can imagine how busy that has us.  I have family coming in for the<br>
wedding as well as the Holidays, and.... I have surgery on the 6th of<br>
January.  I am sorry guys, there is just no time for letterboxing right now.<br>
What I can promise is that during my 4-6 week recovery I will be carving all<br>
sorts of new stamps again and that our area will be inundated with Team<br>
Chaos boxes.<br>

Hope you all have a Happy Holidays.<br>
