                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just have to say, this has become my all time favorite letterbox to <br>
date.  We had the most incredible day.  My dh was on a fishing <br>
charter out of Ilwaco, so dd and I came along and boxed that day.  <br>
(Sat) <br>
<br>
Well, we headed off to do the lighthouses, we got to the top where <br>
North Head lies and ran into two doe and 4 fawns, 2 were yearlings <br>
and 2 were just beginning to loose their spots.  They stayed frozen <br>
in the grass as we approached, and the littlest were bedded right in <br>
the spot the box was, so we went a bit further and allowed them to <br>
slip away before returning.  Well, dd and I sat down to log in and I <br>
feel somthing right off to my right shoulder.  Here's a fawn, just <br>
peeking in to check us out!  We sat real still and soon the whole <br>
herd was grazing amoung us.  It was the coolest thing! I was very <br>
aware that these are WILD animals....  and kept my eyes peeled and dd <br>
close, but they seemed to do their thing and we did ours.  After <br>
about an hour, I finally stood up and headed down the hill, the deer <br>
just stayed there and watched us go!  It was so cool!  <br>
<br>
The veiws were spectacular, and the day was lovely, and the stamps <br>
are great!  The boxes are in great shape with relatively few finds <br>
considering they are from 2001!  <br>
<br>
Thanks for the opportunity for this experience Paisley Orca!  I got <br>
fantastic photos!  And memories to last a lifetime!  Wingnut<br>
