by popular demand, as the case may be), I have added a new stamp to <br/>
the rare and elusive African Safari Series of the Colubmia River <br/>
Gorge.  Since everyone knows where my website is, I won't mention it <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
AND...  I do not intend to post this clue on the main letterboxing <br/>
website.  I feel my boxes may become endangered species as more and <br/>
more people start checking it--including authority figures I'd <br/>
probably not want reading my clues.  (It seems there's an "issue" <br/>
with the box I hid on the AT in Massachusetts.  *rolling eyes*)<br/>
<br/>
So anyhow, the new clue is at <br/>

Enjoy!  =)<br/>
