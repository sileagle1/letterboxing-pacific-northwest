on Saturday and took a cruise up to Yacolt to check on our boxes. <br/>
Alas, I have my first casualty and it wasn't even found yet. The "Luv <br/>
Ya" Letterbox has washed away somewhere down the Lewis River and it <br/>
still had it's "Firsties" prize. Oh well, I will be recarving the <br/>
stamp and replacing the box on higher ground soon so in the meantime <br/>
this box is MIA. Lucia Falls, Chelatchie Prairie Railroad and Moulton <br/>
Falls are all alive and well and dry and waiting for visitors. Each <br/>
one has some magnificent views of waterfalls in the area with water <br/>
roaring by. Well worth the drive out there. The view of Mt. St. <br/>
Helens is spectacular off of SR 503! All three trails are kid and <br/>
stroller friendly so bundle up the kiddies and head out to Yacolt!<br/>
