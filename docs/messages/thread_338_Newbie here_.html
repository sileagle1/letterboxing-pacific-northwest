this "letterboxing" by chance and never have heard about it before.<br>
I'm from Seattle, WA, USA and am a single Mom with three teenager<br>
boys (12,13,15).  I've been taking them on road trips (an unwritten<br>
goal of mine is to take them to as many National Parks as possible<br>
before they all leave home).  We're also involved with Boy Scouting<br>
and love to hike and backpack and camp and all that fun stuff.<br>
This sounds so cool to me because I think it would add another<br>
dimension to our outings.  And I think will keep my boys interested<br>
even more!  Well, okay, me too!  ;)<br>
<br>
Where can I go to learn more about it?  And where to "hunt" for these<br>
hidden treasures?  I don't suppose there would be any in North Idaho-<br>
Northwestern Montana, would there?  I'm taking a short week camping<br>
trip there this summer!  ;)<br>

Thanks!<br>

<br>
Best site for clues is the offical LBNA site (www.letterboxing.org).<br>
<br>
Also, there's my site, strictly tracking Washington State Boxes <br>
(www.letterboxingmischief.com)<br>
<br>
Have fun!!<br>

<br>
There are boxes in North Idaho (not sure about Montana).  And since you'll<br>
likely be coming through Spokane, you can pick off a few there too!<br>
<br>
The best place to learn about this hobby/sport is to ask questions right<br>
here.  There are a lot of letterboxers in the Seattle area.  You may be able<br>
to arrange to meet with them - perhaps at one of the local letterbox<br>
gatherings !<br>
<br>
And, of course, check out the web site at:<br>
<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org<br>
<br>
Again, welcome to the Pacific Northwest Letterboxing list!<br>
