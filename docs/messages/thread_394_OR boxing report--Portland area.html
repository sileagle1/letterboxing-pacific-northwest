                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a report on some local boxes:<br>
<br>
Bon Appetit was yummy!  All 3 boxes alive & well.  Clue #3 says "You will <br>
come to a cross roads where gone are the days when you could sail off a boulder <br>
on a rope swing, alas!" but there is indeed a swing there--newly placed, it <br>
appears.  I'm assuming the clues could now be rewritten (tho my boxing partner <br>
reads the clue to simply suggest that we're too old to go swinging!  Who, <br>
us????).<br>
<br>
I interrupted my Blues Festing on 4th of July to track down esp--found the <br>
box with no trouble, but not the nearby geocache that others mentioned finding.  <br>
With this box I indoctrinated a nice teenager (who'd innocently come to <br>
listen to the blues) into our curious hobby.  <br>
<br>
Tribute is alive & flaming away.  But hey, Wingnut, the pages are coming out <br>
of the log.   (Glad to find this box--it was the only one we managed to find <br>
at the Arboretum--looks like we need to do some homework before attempting to <br>
take a wonderful tour again!  Shoot, we never even met up with the flight <br>
attendant!) <br>
<br>
Lorikeet is quite discreet.  A group of LBing kids had stamped in (ages were <br>
listed with stamps)--we didn't recognize any of them.  One side of the first <br>
log page is filled up.<br>
<br>
Winking Eagle rewarded Heather when she properly followed directions despite <br>
her better judgement!<br>
<br>
<br>
Gosh, these were all such clever/well-done stamps!  Portland sets the bar <br>
high.  Thanks to Hedgehog, soggy2pair, Wingnut, Brett & Penny, and Windairen and <br>
the Plundering Bunny for a lotta fun!!!!<br>

Thanks--I meant to mention this.  We did a quite thorough search and got <br>
nada.  Both Heather and I took a turn, then we sicced the three oldest kids on it. <br>
 If it's not missing it's VERY well hidden (as you know, we have missed your <br>
boxes before, Funhog!).<br>

PS - I think we will make the potluck Friday, Penny tentatively <br>
