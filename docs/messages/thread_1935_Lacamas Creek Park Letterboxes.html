What a beautiful afternoon it was yesterday! Cat's Meow and I finally <br>
got a chance to venture out and hunt for boxes and of course we had <br>
to go after the 2 new boxes by SloMo and Woodauge. Both are alive and <br>
well and what a beautiful carving Contemplation is! This is one stamp <br>
the you really need to have in your collection.<br>
While there we checked on a few other boxes:<br>
<br>
Der Mad Stamper's Lacamas Creek #2 alive and well and not visited <br>
since October 2004.<br>
ISignAsLily's Glub Blub alive and well despite reports of it gone <br>
missing.<br>
My own PNW Wildlife Series *OWL* alive and well and not visited since <br>
September 2004.<br>
<br>
Come on people. Lets get out there and box!<br>

noticed we were only a day behind you on those boxes by SloMo and Woodauge<br>
and I have to agree, both are fantastic stamps, I adored Contemplation!!!!<br>
We didn't make it up to Der Mad Stamper's boxes, but did stamp into Glub<br>
Blub and PNW *OWL*, which is another gorgeous stamp you definitely want in<br>
your book. VERY well done! <br>
 <br>
The kids and I also hit a semi mystery box early this morning and rehid the<br>
Instant Gratification box in it, with six stamps in it. It's a good time to<br>
hit it if you want to join in on the fun!<br>
