version of The Columbian but it doesn't look like it's available <br/>
there.  I did come across something that seems quite similar to our <br/>
hobby, though--who knew?<br/>
<br/>
http://www.columbian.com/<br/>
<br/>
Then do a search on 'questing'--it's the hit about The Orb!  Sounds <br/>
cool, doesn't it?<br/>

I was running a little late -- so while "Sunshine" was there, "Twilight"<br/>
didn't make the picture (tho he quite nicely quoted me in the article<br/>

I open our paper today, The Columbian, and what do I find but a <br/>
great article about local letterboxers and the wonderful pastime <br/>
that we all love.  There is rather large picture of Hoopoe's stamp <br/>
in a log book at the Redmond Watershed.   Also a picture of Katie <br/>
Mohn and Glory Robinson doing some boxing. If Hoopoe would like a <br/>
