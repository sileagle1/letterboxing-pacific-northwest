                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also have had a great letterboxing weekend. I work long hours at a very stressful job. I totally look forward to the weekend when I can play. I love the fact that I can combine art stuff with nature stuff. And a little exercise as well cuz dang I need it. Yesterday when I arrived at a park, I saw that my friend was heading up the hill on foot. I stopped the truck and said, "We're WALKING up? Are you mad?" Well, we were and I did. I pushed myself physically just to get a little plastic box! But, darn, I'm so glad that I did cuz it really rocked. Of course, today I'm on pain pills and using the cane but it's worth it. I love that the whole family can go. My dogs love to letterbox. Sometimes they have to stay in the car, but not often. This Friday (I work 4 days a week usually) my spouse and I were going to babysit for a friend while she went to school so we left the house at 6 am. The dogs were having a cow cuz I kenneled them. It was as if they knew it was fri day and letter<br/>
 boxing day and how dare I leave them home! I also love that it's a forum for me to make a statement about things in an artsy way. I can carve and make boxes to reflect my interests. Anyone who looks at my boxes can immediately know some of the things that are important to me. I also love putting boxes in special places to me. <br/>
