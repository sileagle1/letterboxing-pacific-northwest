We'll be heading out tomorrow for some mor ebeautiful hikes and maybe <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Rats! I'm sorry that the box didn't reveal itself to you. I was just<br/>
there last Sunday, reveled at the spring and checked up on the box.<br/>
That trail is beginning to erode so badly in places, I thought I might<br/>
have to pull the box sometime in the future.<br/>
<br/>
This is the perfect time of year to do this hike, though. The canyon<br/>
can be killer hot in the summer and the nettles can be a real drag.<br/>
You should be able to find the letterbox in spite of the leaves... Funhog<br/>
