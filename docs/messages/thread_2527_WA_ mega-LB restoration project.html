Hi there fellow WA letterboxers--<br/>
<br/>
I know this may be a lost cause but here goes anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Beware the hazards of planting LBs beyond your means--I'm learning <br/>
this lesson the excrutiatingly painful way as life has a habit of <br/>
taking weird twists and turns along the way.  :(<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a mega-project to transfer clues to all of our 200 <br/>
some letterboxes over to AQ in anticipation of our probably having <br/>
to 'orphan' all but a handful of these boxes scattered around the <br/>
region when we move away in about 6 weeks.  I'm even doing this for <br/>
boxes that have gone 'missing' over the years as occasionally some <br/>
of these boxes magically 'come back to life' somehow and leaving the <br/>
clues available floating around the ethernet 'just in case' may help <br/>
revive an otherwise 'dead to the world' letterbox out there if &amp; <br/>
when it happens (like my ever returning back to life Ecola LB down <br/>
in Oregon or Dolphin Mystery LB in WA).<br/>
<br/>
In working on this WAY TOO time consuming project (I'm 25% done and <br/>
it's already taken some 12 wholly dedicated hours so far) I've been <br/>
scrubbing the clues for accuracy and stumbled on some glitches with <br/>
some of our clue sets.  <br/>
<br/>
For some reason (possibly because our clue website has been hacked a <br/>
couple of times over the years?) clues to some of our boxes that <br/>
we've repositioned for various reasons over the years have reverted <br/>
back to their 'original' clue sets.  Because we're currently 5,700 <br/>
miles away from our 'logbooks' that hopefully contain the <br/>
original 'updated' clues, I'm unable to update these clue sets until <br/>
that time we 'potentially' reunite with this info. This has happened <br/>
for a handful of boxes but specifically I'm only trying to sort out <br/>
the ones that are likely still active out there.<br/>
<br/>
As I work on this project I may post requests for anybody who might <br/>
have printed up clues to some of these problematic clue listings at <br/>
the time when the 'correct' clues were available who might be able <br/>
to provide me the modified clues.  <br/>
<br/>
Currently the one that is obviously incorrect &amp; likely still active <br/>
is:<br/>
<br/>
Zug-Wa Monster in Tumwater, WA<br/>
<br/>
(as its current hiding spot is about 1/2km away from where the clues <br/>
online suggest it is as I had to move it due to a geocache proximity <br/>
conflict)<br/>
<br/>
So, if anybody has a clue available for this letterbox dated from <br/>
about Jan-May 05 (not the one currently visible on the internet) I'd <br/>
greatly appreciate about the last two paragraphs of it.  There are a <br/>
couple of folks who found it in the current location about a year <br/>
ago so the clues made it out there at some point in its existence--<br/>
otherwise these folks would have found it using the microscopic <br/>
needle in the massive 50 acre haystack approach. <br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to do the 'responsible' thing here and really think I <br/>
should just pull/retire most of these boxes so as to not burden <br/>
others with this problem.  My hope with this effort is that we can <br/>
leave as many of our surviving letterboxes intact and in great <br/>
condition before we depart.  My fear, however, is that many of these <br/>
boxes will eventually 'fade away' in time from neglect (which we've <br/>
observed with many other boxes over the years) and will only cause <br/>
frustration for new letterboxers and eventually turn <br/>
into 'pollution' which is really why I almost feel the need to <br/>
retire most of them.  It's a rather stressful predicament as it's no <br/>
fun to 'leave your babies' stranded in the world.  Any LB planter <br/>
will empathize with this...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help you can provide us!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I understand what you are saying about not wanting to abandon boxes for whatever fate.  Still, I would be very very sad to see so many of your boxes disappear.  It already makes me sad to hear that the one in Rockport is gone, and I wish I could have gotten back to Mamie Shaddock to give that box another go, since I ran out of daylight the one time I did get to look for it.<br/>
<br/>
  With AQ's previous finds list, it's not entirely up to the planter of the box to get information out about the status of the boxes.  We can simply send a message to somebody else who's found it and see if it's where it's supposed to be.  So you wouldn't have to orphan them or adopt them out entirely, but could just get help from others who find them.<br/>
<br/>
  I would just really hate to see the end of so many of your boxes.  They're legends!<br/>
