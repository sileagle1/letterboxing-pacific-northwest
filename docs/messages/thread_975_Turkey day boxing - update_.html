<br/>
We attempted the Extreme Box, but we quickly found that our climbing equipment was inadequate for this particular climb.  We are working on upgrading and are determined to get it.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed for Forest Park for a Dog day afternoon.  We found Skip and Spot. Fido escaped our grasp.  We'll wait for Rover to return and then go back for both. <br/>
<br/>
While we were out we placed our 1st box of the Makin' Tracks series.  The Hiker.<br/>
<br/>
We ran short of daylight and the gang was fixing a big bird and dinner would not wait long for us to get there.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope ya'll had a fun filled and happy day as well!<br/>
