                    <div class="plaintext-content"> We have been fairly lucky in our finds since our finds have been 22 <br>
to not finding 5. We are seeing a trend that we have been unable to <br>
find any of DVN2RCKR's letterboxes which we looked for 2 of them this <br>
weekend. The Cape dissappointment one we looked for 1 1/2 hours and <br>
finally called it quits when the kids were whining so bad to go home. <br>
Then we tried to find the Picea Stitchensis one, but had a later <br>
start so it was almost dark and again couldn't find it.And we didn't <br>
get to the Ft Canby one this time to try a second time to find it. It <br>
is very challenging and we love the challenge, but if there is any <br>
help out there we would love it. It is going to drive us crazy until <br>
we can take the time to go find them again which looks to be at least <br>
3 months, to our unhappiness :( Oh well I think those that we don't <br>
find are the ones that make the find more worth it. We hope all of <br>
you had a fun weekend letterboxing. We love to hear the stories.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We very much enjoyed the time we had there.  We checked them and we <br>
for some reason thought they were from you.  We didn't look very well <br>
at the Ft Canby Lighthouse Series to see who they were from.We were <br>
stuck on the last one we looked for which was the 'picea <br>
sitchensis'and just assumed they were from the same person.We  <br>
basically were wondering if others had found these hard ones to find <br>
also.  Thanks. <br>
