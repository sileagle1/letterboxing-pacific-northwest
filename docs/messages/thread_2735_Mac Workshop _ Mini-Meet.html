Anyone who doesn't have plans on Saturday (or can wiggle out of them)<br>
is welcome to join us at the McMinnville Community Center, 600 NE<br>
Evans St, this Saturday from 1-4.<br>
<br>
Besides the Introductory Workshop, the room is open to anyone who<br>
wants to come carve, make logbooks, exchange, meet up and go boxing,<br>
snack, whatever! I'm planning to make brownies if that helps. Any<br>
donations to cover the room cost would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Sign-up on AtlasQuest. I'll bring more PNW Lb t-shirts if you want to<br>
pick one up.<br>
<br>
And I apologize if you're sick of hearing about this!<br>
