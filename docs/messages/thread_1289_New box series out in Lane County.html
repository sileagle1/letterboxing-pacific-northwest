<br>
It is called <br>
<http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=7873&boxname=Hattitude>Hattitude.<br>
<br>
We have had fun creating the series...Now, we just have to finish hiding <br>
the rest of the "hats".   Some hats were created by me...others were <br>
created by Raellyn  of Team Tired Feet and a couple were created by my <br>
daughter Samantha who is 7 years old.<br>
<br>
Eugene/Springfield is starting to get a few boxes hidden around the <br>
area....hopefully when out towners visit they find it worth their time to <br>
hunt everyone's letterboxes.  :)<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting,<br>
