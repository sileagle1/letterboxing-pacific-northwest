<br>
Thank you for placing the boxes.  We had quite a good time finding them.  We<br>
started out planning to get only the other boxes in the park and did none of<br>
those just the Scout boxes - isn't the spontaneity of this hobby great!<br>
<br>
Anyway please let the girls know that I so learning about each country that<br>
I reformatted the info and made it a permanent part of our log book!  Seems<br>
like we need to add "Bwange" to the English language!  You think?<br>
<br>
Now we just need to go back and get impressions from the last several boxes<br>
so we have all the colorful stamps!<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
SloMo and Wood-aug<br>
