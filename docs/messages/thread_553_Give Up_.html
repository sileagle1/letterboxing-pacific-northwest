    We'd be happy to turn the Clown Series back over to you, we just took them because they were listed as abandoned.  We've checked that, cleaned them and restocked them, they are all fine.  If you want us to keep tabs on them for you here, we'd also be happy to do so, they are still listed as you being the placer in the clues, just that from the database side, I'm listed as the placer.  Let me know what you want.<br/>
