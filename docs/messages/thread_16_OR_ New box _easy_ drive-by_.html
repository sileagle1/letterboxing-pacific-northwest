Monty Python’s “Department of Redundancy Department” would have loved the <br/>
“City of Oregon City City Hall” sign.  This letterbox isn’t located by the <br/>
sign, though—it’s hidden in Park Place park, which also seemed appropriately <br/>
appropriate. <br/>
<br/>
To get to Park Place park in the City of Oregon City: from 205, take #10 exit <br/>
Park Place/Mollala (coming from the north, follow the road as it curves <br/>
around over the freeway; you’ll be heading in the correct direction on <br/>
213—merge immd. into the left turn lane; coming from the south, turn right <br/>
onto 213, and merge immd. into the left turn lane).  At the first light, turn <br/>
left onto Clackamas River Road.  Turn right onto Forsythe.  Turn right onto <br/>
Front Ave (watch for it as you’re driving uphill). Park Place park will be on <br/>
your left.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once you’ve parked at Park Place park, you’ll see that there are two little <br/>
play areas with two benches.  There are also two grassy areas; one to the <br/>
north and one to the south.  Go to the northern one.<br/>
<br/>
Look for the oak tree with two trunks.  You’ll find the Department of <br/>
Redundancy Department letterbox under a rock at its base.  Please be sure to <br/>
stamp in, and don’t forget to stamp in! <br/>
