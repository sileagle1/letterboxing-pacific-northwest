<br/>
I've been lurking for a few months now and started letterboxing a few <br/>
months ago. I still haven't carved my stamp and that's all that is <br/>
keeping me from going hogwild. I have hunted around and found a few <br/>
boxes and I even placed my own box last month.<br/>
<br/>
I finally got around to writing up the clues and posting it on the <br/>
site today. My first box! How exciting! I have to say that the stamp <br/>
isn't the most attractive but hey! It's my first stamp. I know it'll <br/>
get better with time. And I carved it at 11 o'clock at night by <br/>
headlamp so we could place it and leave the island before the wind <br/>
increased. Yes, you have to travel by boat to get to this box. I'm <br/>
hoping that it will be the first of the Cascadia Marine Trail Series. <br/>
For now, it's on it's own.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
