July 31, 2010<br>
4:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.<br>
Star, Idaho<br>
Snacks will be provided<br>
<br>
Details:<br>
<br>
A group of us are going to get together for a carving workshop. If you're new to carving, this should be a great opportunity to find out more about transfer techniques, carving tools, carving material, and more. Contact me (Capperpillar) for the address of the location.<br>
<br>
Bring some images that you would like to try to carve. If you have carving tools and supplies, bring them along, too. If you don't have any yet, that's fine. I'll bring all of my stuff so you can try out some different things.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for images online, the image search on google has advanced search settings where you can limit your search to "line drawings". If you find something that's not a line drawing, that's fine, too.<br>
<br>
There's a free online pencil sketch tool that converts jpg, gif, or png files into line drawings. You can find it at http://www.dumpr.net/sketch.php. It works better for some images than others. Sometimes it helps to mess with the brightness and contrast of the image first.<br>

<br>
The other issue is that I am going to need to pull my clues down again for Idaho.  Saturday I had to retire three boxes because someone is stealing the stamps.  This is the same thing that happened at the end of 2009 and in January.  We were hoping they got tired of doing it but it appears that is not the case.  You will need to contact me directly for clues if you come.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">will do, not yet sure what my route is. Planning it is part of my homework<br>
this week.<br>
<br>
I'v made my penninsula boxes in Washington WOM this week. I have a couple of<br>
them out there that are just too good to lose to the Forest Defender. Are<br>
you pulling the clues completely or just listing them as WOM?<br>
<br>
I just took a quick look at the map, if I go east then south it is pretty<br>
likely I'll make it by your way. My problem, (always when I go somewhere<br>
Unfamiliar) I will need a place to park a very large bus for at least one<br>
night or two. I prefer dry camping to paying park fees when i'm on the road<br>
but if there is a reasonably priced rv or city park near by that works too.<br>
Driveways, parking lots.... they're all good as long as the owners are<br>
agreeable.  Do you remember the very large light blue and white motorhome at<br>
LIve and breathe? that's it.<br>
<br>
Let's plan on it in pencil.<br>
<br>
Next friday I'm going to Port Orchard for either one weekend, or two<br>
weekends and a week. Then will be hitting the road after that. Could arrive<br>
Idaho any time during that following week depending on letterboxing stops.<br>
Will know more when we get closer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Any day of the week better for you than others?<br>
