folks had a great time with them.  I personally loved them!  After<br>
all, we are in the stamp collecting business  hey?.  <br>
Had to add a new category to my database since they don't seem to fit<br>
under the standard headings but a couple of mouse clicks took care of<br>
that. <br>
  See:     http://www.qsl.net/kc7dh/cooties.htm   <br>
  for the 9 I collected (127k).<br>
Thank you Event Committee for the extra effort! <br>
Bring em on!  More cooties, more cooties, more cooties.<br>

Yep I think you got it. The cooties are created in a fashion that they are<br>
intended to be passed along from Letterboxer to Letterboxer. You can call it<br>
an infected personal traveler of sorts. But once it is handed to another<br>
Letterboxer it is theirs to then pass on to someone else. The people who<br>
created them - myself included in that as begin the designer -drawer- of<br>
their little DNA's -chuckles- had are of the mind set that Letterboxing is<br>
also a social activity.  Which it is - it is enjoyable to talk about -<br>
therefore perhaps a cootie or two will be a good ice breaker - and a small<br>
beginning to having more people meet up together to enjoy this wonderful<br>
hobby. <br>
<br>
So infect the North West with cooties - and soon cooties will rule the<br>
world!! -smiles-<br>

Actually all I did was draw the cooties - pandora carved them and<br>
CampFireLady made up the log books and boxes that they go in. A cootie is<br>
sort of personal traveler hybrid - which is sort of like an exchange of<br>
personal stamps. You can only get them physically from one Letterboxer to<br>
another. How you receive them is up to the creativity of the one that holds<br>
to cootie. You may find it in your bag - or tent - handed to you directly -<br>
or taped to a card at the foot of your trailer - like what happened at the<br>
Stamp Cam Event in August. However I would care to bet that there will be<br>
cooties floating around at the FF2 event coming up so you may want to<br>
consider coming if at all possible - since they are not an actual letterbox<br>
or anything of that sort I believe that Charlie Trail Duster has images of<br>
some of them on his website. Perhaps we would be so inclined to share that<br>
address with you to take a look at if you are interested. <br>

I heard a rumor that you can get cooties just from letterboxing in Gresham. <br>

You can download a graphic of the 9 cooties that I have found so far<br>
at this address:<br>

<br>
I believe there currently are 12 total (and hopefully will be more).<br>
