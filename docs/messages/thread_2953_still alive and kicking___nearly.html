Just wanted to let anyone living in or visiting Central Oregon that we've updated our boxes here. Duck Soup has been replaced, after a long hiatus; The Lorax as well, in Redmond's south Dry Canyon; and Box #1 of the Redmond Lava Caves is new as well (again). Actually Box#1 stamp is really Box#3's extra stamp from before...but you get the idea. The three clues lead to three boxes. <br>

Have fun!<br>
