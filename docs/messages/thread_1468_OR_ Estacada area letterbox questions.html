Today my wife and I want letterboxing in the Estacada area.  We <br>
found a bunch but were stumped by a few of them.  I was wondering if <br>
anyone has found the following boxes recently and if so do they have <br>
any advice to help us.<br>
<br>
At McIver State Park<br>
<br>
Special Delivery<br>
Sunburst<br>
Mini Cooper<br>
<br>
And at Timber Park<br>
<br>
Whippet Litter - Whippet<br>
Bistro<br>
<br>
<br>
We also couldn't find the Icebox at Feyrer park but I think it was <br>
because were too tired to figure out the clue.<br>
<br>
We did find the Jurasic Park boxes and the county park boxes at <br>
Carver, Barton, and Metzger.  Eagle Fern park is for the next couple <br>
of days.<br>

  Bistro was there in early June, so something must have happened to<br>
  it between now and then. With school out now there are a lot of<br>
