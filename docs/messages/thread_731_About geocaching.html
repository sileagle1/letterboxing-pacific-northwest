  Funny, I just posted a message on the PNW Talk List about an hour ago that made <br>
  almost the same points. Right on target, Silent Doug. Funhog<br>

Well, in my not so humble opinion, and I mean no disrespect when I say this,<br>
but the two are completely different other than the foundation.  To say that<br>
they are the same because one hides something and others find it is like<br>
saying that a Ford and a Ferrari or BMW or Jaguar or MG are the same because<br>
they all use gasoline and oil.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that all geocachers destroy the environment, nor am I saying<br>
that all letterboxers are it's champions either.  I am saying that, because<br>
of the sheer numbers, the same numbers that you quote, it becomes more a<br>
game of quantity than quality.<br>
<br>
It has been my experience that most people in today's society, and I'm not<br>
pointing fingers at anyone,  want the easy things, they want things given to<br>
them, they'd rather someone else did the work for them.  They are by far,<br>
much to lazy to exercise their brain, let alone their legs.  Bu that's not<br>
the main point here.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, if you enjoy letterboxing, then by all means do<br>
letterboxing.  If you enjoy geocaching, do geocaching.  Whichever hobby to<br>
decide upon, or if you decide upon both, more power to you.  In this day and<br>
age, finding people that are respectful of themselves, let alone, other<br>
people, or even the environment, is a rare thing.  Respect the environment,<br>
become it's steward, there's not much left and what is left, is being<br>
damaged at a rate that will overwhelm you if it doesn't make you bury your<br>
head in the sand and pretend it's not happening.  This isn't about which<br>
ones better, letterboxing or geocaching, nor is it about which makes you a<br>
better person, neither do that. Only you can make a difference, and it has<br>
become my experience that far to few strive to make that change within<br>
themselves.<br>
<br>
I'm no better than anyone on this list and if any of my words have come<br>
across in that manner here and now or before, I apologize and beg your<br>
forgiveness.  My intent is to share my thoughts and ideas, my feelings and<br>
to learn from you. No to harp and tell you how it must be.  I am a very<br>
strong willed person and tend to vocally (Whether in real time or here in<br>
cyberspace) share those thoughts.  (Grin)<br>
<br>
I personally will not become a geocacher. It does not draw me only for one<br>
reason.  Using a technological device to drive to the spot where the hidden<br>
treasure lies (+/- 25 feet or more, depending on the accuracy of the device<br>
being used initially) is not something that I find a thrill in. On the other<br>
hand, using my story telling abilities to weave a story, my limited carving<br>
abilities to create a one of a kind, work of art to some, a simple rubber<br>
stamp to others, to find the location to place that letterbox, to place it<br>
and to watch and wait for a report that someone has found it, that's what<br>
draws me.<br>
<br>
And it makes me no better or worse than anyone else.<br>

P.S.  If there's only a few letterboxes in your area, plant more.  "Plant it<br>
and they will come!" is the motto of our website. Tell others about your<br>
hobby and share it.  Before you know it, you'll have more letterboxes than<br>
you can shake a stick at and you'll have fostered some of the best<br>
friendships you can imagine, all because you shared your passion with your<br>
fellow man (Or woman).  Give it a try, what's the worst that can happen? No<br>
one else ever plants any letterboxes and you continue on geocaching.  Just a<br>
thought.<br>
