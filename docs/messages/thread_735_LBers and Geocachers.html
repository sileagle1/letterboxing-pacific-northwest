                    <div class="plaintext-content">The main difference between LBers and Geocachers is LBer's clues are usually<br/>
more precise causing us to search an area less. The bottom line is both<br/>
groups are known to not always leave the area the same way they found it.<br/>
Many a box can be found by following the path to the pile of sticks<br/>
signaling it's hiding place. If we want this hobby to continue we need to be<br/>
selective and creative in choosing our hiding places AND follow Rayvenhaus's<br/>
example and clean up behind ourselves and sometimes others. We already have<br/>
a problem with boxes in some State and Federal Parks and it isn't because we<br/>
are a positive impact on the parks. To change this, if it's not too late, we<br/>
had better take a close look at how and where we are hiding our boxes.<br/>
<br/>
All this ties into something that has been on my mind for quite some time.<br/>
The first box I found was on Rattlesnake Ledge. A moderate hike, HA! A<br/>
killer for this old man but well worth the effort. A beautiful place. It<br/>
made me think that a big part of Letterboxing was finding a special place to<br/>
lead people to. What I have seen since then is a shift from quality to<br/>
quantity (Sorry Ryan). To some it seems to have turned into a race of how<br/>
many boxes can they get or place and little else.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion and maybe a tibit for thought.<br/>

quite a few of lesser quality in all aspects, hikes, carvings, clues, <br/>
origonality.....  I suppose being a newbie myself I am guilty of this <br/>
even, and no, no offense was taken, I think as we "mature" we figure <br/>
out better ways to box....  As a newbie and a mother of a 2 year old <br/>
in tow, I also see the value for some easy boxes... it keeps it <br/>
interesting and provides some access to the sport that others <br/>
wouldn't get if they had to always do a 6 mile hike.  <br/>
<br/>
ALTHOUGH.....   I have become very dissapointed lately with bad <br/>
rehides, and even bad placement of new boxes.... (that go missing <br/>
within days of placement) and 30 second carvings.....  or even worse, <br/>
store bought stamps.  I blame it partially on the recent articles in <br/>
local papers.  I certainly hope when the publicity dies down, things <br/>
can go back to being much more descreet!  New people mean new <br/>
boxes..... I think that's a good thing....  and I am sure many people <br/>
will fade given a bit of time for the newness to wear off. <br/>
<br/>
I find as I get more into it, I am writing better clues, placing <br/>
better, and carving much better...... I have definately adopted a <br/>
quality over quantity rule for myself, and a sense of respect for <br/>
everyone, by checking up frequently on my placed boxes... and <br/>
maintaing clues.  I try to only place what I can keep up with.<br/>
<br/>
I see the value in the longer hikes for just one box... And really <br/>
enjoy the hiking and all the nature I am seeing.  I am even finding <br/>
ways to sneak out for a day with out my 2 year old to do the more <br/>
dificult boxes....<br/>
<br/>
All in all I would have to say.... there is something for everyone.  <br/>
And I hope that the new people take the time to research things a bit <br/>
and think throught thier carvings and placings, and maintence, it <br/>
makes it that much more enjoyable for all!  <br/>
<br/>
And Mr Evil (he he he)  We are all entitled to an opinion....  speak <br/>
away, I love to hear it!   Wingnut<br/>

the hikes get too long then I start hearing, "are we there yet?" they lose interest and then the <br/>
outting loses its purpose, having FUN. So maybe the solution is that if you don't like the drop <br/>
by or easy boxes then don't get them. The same for us with small children, we  may not want to <br/>
go get those boxes that are longer hikes. I think the variety is great! As for the quality, I agree, <br/>
we need to make a valiant effort to make those stamps, clues and hiding places special. there is <br/>
no greater thrill than figuring out great clues and being rewarded with a great stamp! A good <br/>
example of some great clues is "Quail Ale" in Central Oregon, placed by Funhog. Check it out.<br/>
