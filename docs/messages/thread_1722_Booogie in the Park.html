Ryan and I just got back from Booogie in the Park. Unfortunately, we <br/>
had to leave early so that I could go back to work. We had a great <br/>
time. It was terrific to meet some of the newer letterboxers in the <br/>
area and see some old friends again!  I will have to get back to <br/>
Millersylvania again soon to pick up all the letterboxes that I <br/>
didn't have time for today. Kudos to Teams Rayvenhaus and Chaos for <br/>
hosting another great Fright Fest!<br/>

We just got home, too!  What a great event!!!  It was fun meeting <br/>
all the new letterboxers in the area.  Woo hoo!!!  The letterboxes <br/>
we were able to find in the park today (dodging raindrops &amp; hail <br/>
along the way) were awesome--thanks everybody for planting such neat <br/>
boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Team Rayvenhaus, Iron Bear, Pandora, Maiden &amp; Camp Fire Lady <br/>
for putting some much planning into another great event.  Thanks <br/>
everybody else who planted such cool boxes.  Hopefully, we'll get a <br/>
chance to look for them sometime in the near future!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care all,<br/>

about 20 were kids. I have to say it was wonderful. Lots and lots of<br/>
families, tons of fun for everyone, and just a plain old good time. Both of<br/>
my  kids had a blast making new friends and I hiked many miles and ended up<br/>
with 11 new boxes. Each one of those boxes were fantastic and I have to<br/>
thank  Team Ravyenhaus, Heather, and ISignASLily for planting them. They are<br/>
wonderful additions to my logbook. I loved meeting so many new people and<br/>
walking in such a beautiful park. I can not think of a better way to spend a<br/>
Saturday. Even if it did hail a bit towards the end :) <br/>

It was great to meet all of you folks today.  The Nail Family had a<br/>
great time just chatting with everyone and enjoying the plentiful food<br/>
provided by our hosts and other attendees.  We plan to get back out<br/>
there on Monday or Tuesday and find all those boxes!  <br/>
<br/>
It was especially great to meet Der Mad Stamper, Camp Fire Lady,<br/>
Maiden, Team Nashoba, Secret Agent and Never Enough, Big Dogs, and<br/>
others I cant recall names of without looking at my log book.  We had<br/>
lots of fun chatting with Pandora and Team Ravenhaus as well as old<br/>
friends dvnrckr (and kids and dad too!), Ryan and Amanda, and Fudrick<br/>
(even though he showed up late). But who was that mysterious fellow in<br/>
the shadows? I didnt catch his name. The kid's activities were<br/>
awesome, the cooties were cool, and the fire was just what we needed<br/>
to keep warm!  We had an awesome time and will look forward to next<br/>
year too!<br/>
<br/>
A quick note to those who didnt attend and anyone who did but didnt<br/>
get to find the Moondance box:  We will be pulling the Moondance box<br/>
at the end of the month so if you have not gotten to it yet you still<br/>
have till the end of October before it will be pulled and shelved<br/>
until next October.  Its a marvelous night for a Moondance!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Kris, Steve, Pandora, Iron Bear, Maiden, and Camp Fire<br/>
Lady for a great event. You guys really know how to throw a party!<br/>

What a fabulous time me and the kiddos had at FF2!  The kids could <br/>
not stop talking about it ALL the way home.  My daughter has <br/>
officially changed her trail name from Cat to Hermione.<br/>
<br/>
It was a special pleasure to finally meet all of the faces behind <br/>
the trail names.  Thanks to Team Rayvenhaus, Iron`Bear, Pandora, <br/>
Maiden &amp; Camp Fire Lady for all the planning that they did.  Your <br/>
efforts are greatly appreciated!  It was nice to also meet Der Mad <br/>
Stamper.  My family is looking forward to getting to Oregon to find <br/>
some more of the wonderful boxes I hear about.  <br/>
<br/>
It was also fun to meet the Nail Family and dvn2r ckr.  Since we <br/>
live in Olympia, we have found quite a few of their boxes.  It was <br/>
great to meet stealthboxxer and get that personal traveler, too!  <br/>
My DH, Big Dog 1, was sorry that he had to work but is looking <br/>
forward to meeting everyone in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again for the Fun!<br/>
