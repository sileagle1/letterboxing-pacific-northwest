<br/>
"Not to mention the increasing number of illegal users, such as those <br/>
involved in what is known as geocaching or letter boxing (sic). <br/>
Geocaching is an adventure game where people use GPS units to locate <br/>
and claim hidden caches left by other gamers.<br/>
<br/>
'It is illegal because it takes people off the trails,' Snyder <br/>
says. 'With more people in the park, the number of illegal trails has <br/>
increased. A greater human presence in these areas means they're <br/>
tracking in more invasive species which then offer a gateway into the <br/>
forest.'"<br/>

I recently read the Portland Tribune article in which you were quoted.<br/>
I love having Forest Park as an urban resource and have hiked the<br/>
entire length of the Wildwood Trail as well as many of the other trail<br/>
found here. Sadly, I was dismayed by part of the current article. <br/>
<br/>
As an active user of Forest Park, a volunteer educator with the Oregon<br/>
Zoo, a birdwatcher as well as an avid letterboxer I found myself<br/>
taking offense when you portrayed this hobby as an "illegal activity"<br/>
because it takes users off trail thus introducing alien species. All<br/>
but one letterbox I have ever found in Forest Park has been adjacent<br/>
to an existing trail and that one has probably had fewer than three<br/>
dozen visits in eight years. You said "bird-watchers, Boy Scouts,<br/>
school groups, dog walkers (hopefully with dogs on leash, as required<br/>
by law) and spiritual groups" use the park. I would venture to guess<br/>
that members of every one of these groups would be just as likely to<br/>
track in an alien species and have been known to go off trail some<br/>
time or another. In fact, the worst alien invader in the park is<br/>
probably English Ivy and most likely made its way in via local<br/>
landscaping rather than on someone's shoes.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot speak for geocachers since I don't participate in that hobby<br/>
but most letterboxers make a great effort to respect the environment.<br/>
If you read the education sections at either of the primary<br/>
letterboxing sites, Letterboxing North America or Atlas Quest, you<br/>
will see that Leave No Trace concepts are highly encouraged. I am sad<br/>
to see letterboxing portrayed in a negative light since I know it as a<br/>
wonderful way to get folks out of their houses and out on the trails.<br/>
Many participants have discovered the bounty of the natural world<br/>
around us here in Portland by being introduced to letterboxing. <br/>

Thank you for responding so quickly and so elequently.  Very well <br/>
said.  I hope the reporter checks out the websites and/or responds to <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, you made your point that with all the multitudes of <br/>
different groups and individuals in the park, blaming letterboxers and <br/>
geocachers solely was unfair.<br/>
