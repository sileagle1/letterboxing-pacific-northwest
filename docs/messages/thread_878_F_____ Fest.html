<br/>
I'm playing the devils advocate this morning  Sorry Steve don't mean <br/>
to be coming off like I am causing to stir trouble  but I also do <br/>
not thinks that Funhogs suggestion falls under the category of <br/>
paranoia or hysteria.  I have also had the opportunity to read the <br/>
letters from the aforementioned company that was sent to the owners <br/>
of the LbNA site and I too suggested to Wes in a private conversation <br/>
this morning that the group be asked not to reference the Event by <br/>
the trademarked name in any fashion.  The ration and logic behind <br/>
this is that not only did the have issues with the trademark <br/>
infringement but also with the fact that it "inevitably tarnish and <br/>
dilute the distinct value and reputation" of their client.  What I <br/>
see is Funhog caring a lot about the status and well being of the <br/>
LbNA site and some long time letterboxing friends.  I too know <br/>
personally that there is some questions as to the LbNA owners having <br/>
to hire a lawyer and that they do not have the funds to do so.  I see <br/>
the concern and honestly I do not think it is so much to ask.  <br/>
Personally I would do it on the LbNA list especially. I think it is <br/>
important to move on as well, but caution never hurt anyone.  As for <br/>
someone being petty enough to report the incident to Wild Waves and <br/>
this is said completely tongue in cheek  I guess you made some <br/>
pretty wild waves out there yourself  I am however glad to see such <br/>
callous attempts to damage your event spoiled and hope that whoever <br/>
did this realizes the impact their actions had not only on Team <br/>
Rayvenhaus, the Tacoma Event, but also several other people who did <br/>
nothing wrong.  I truly hope you are one of the ones that donate to <br/>
legal fees if Wes and Randy need assistance.<br/>
<br/>

Greetings Steve,<br/>
Just to satisfy curiosity Wes and I were disgusing an project that I <br/>
might have in the works =) ... I offered mine and Iron`Bear's <br/>
assistance wherever LbNA *might* need it and Wes mentioned they may <br/>
be asking for donations for legal fees... <br/>
<br/>
Just sort of came up in the midst of a conversation... I don't think <br/>
*everyone* is talking about it, and I certainly am not everyone... <br/>
just pandora =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the clarification on what the lawyer said.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been to several of the afore mentioned recreational locations during the afore mentioned seasonal entertainment and truth be told, the 1st year was a riot, costumes. decorations and all, but subsequent visits proved worth going only because the places remain open later in the season and there are shorter lines on the rides due to colder temperatures.  They have placed so many restrictions on the visitors and the employees (for security reasons, which actually is a good thing), that you might as well remain in street clothing and be comfortable.  I tried to go in as a zebra and spent over an hour taking off face paint, that took 2 hours to apply, before we were allowed in!  My friend couldn't even go in with basic dracula makeup.   Just my thoughts.  ACE members unite!  <br/>
