  *This message was transferred with a trial version of CommuniGate(tm) Pro* Hi fellow Puget Sound letterboxers out there (and any other <br>
  letterboxers who might be interested)!<br>
<br>
  Are any other Puget Sound letterboxers interested in attending a <br>
  South Sound Letterboxing Fest o/a the morning of 9 Aug 03?<br>
<br>
  ***SOUTH SOUND LETTERBOXING FEST  9 AUG 03***<br>
<br>
  I was thinking of a quick get-together somewhere in the South Sound <br>
  area (Olympia/Tacoma area) with a focus of exchanging signature <br>
  stamps/hitchhikers/event letterboxes you might have hanging around <br>
  your house, hitchhikers you want to launch to the 4 winds, etc.  <br>
  Wouldn't need to plant any boxes specific to the event--just an <br>
  opportunity to meet with fellow letterboxers and exchange stamps, <br>
  carving ideas, clue writing hints, etc for a couple of hours.<br>
<br>
  Let me know if there is any interest out there--I've heard from a <br>
  couple of folks off-line already--just want to know if there are <br>
  others out there.  The primary 'gathering' location I was thinking <br>
  of was Tumwater's Historical Park just off of I-5 in the <br>
  Olympia/Tumwater area.  It offers a great picnic/playground area <br>
  with running water & flushing toilets!!!  ;)  If there is enough <br>
  interest & you want to extend the length of the event, we could <br>
  stretch it into a potluck style picnic.  This park is quite <br>
  centrally located to MANY, MANY, MANY letterboxes in the Olympia <br>
  area.<br>
<br>
  ***TUMWATER HISTORICAL PARK, TUMWATER, WA***<br>
<br>
  Another possible meeting location would be Pt Defiance Park in <br>
  Tacoma but it is often QUITE busy on the weekends with only one spot <br>
  with a playground (near the back entrance to the zoo).<br>
<br>
  Please let me know (or, better, yet, post your comments on the board <br>
  so others get the feel for the number of interested letterboxers out <br>
  there):<br>
<br>
  1.  If you are interested in attending.<br>
  2.  Whether you are able to attend on 9 Aug 03 (approx 0900-1000 <br>
  start time and ending whenever), if not--another more feasible <br>
  date/time for your group.<br>
  3.  # in your party<br>
<br>
  This is also a great time to invite your friends who might be <br>
  interested in letterboxing.  What a great time to start the hobby <br>
  with a logbook full of exchanges!!!<br>
<br>
  Hope to here from many of you out there soon.<br>

great place to meet!<br>
<br>
There are 7 picnic tables by the playground, should be enough to hold all of<br>
us.  There are 5 or so tables behind the rest rooms (with flush toilets!!!)<br>
from the playground if the first ones are already full.  They are<br>
first-come, first-eat tables, so those early risers can save the tables for<br>
the rest.  There is a covered area, but it requires a reservation and a fee<br>
:-(<br>
<br>
I will be in that area again Sunday, will verify the best way to get there<br>
from both North and South bound I-5, will post Sunday evening to this fine<br>
chat group, so you all won't miss all the fun (unless all the Fun is Hogged<br>
by the time you get there :-)  It is an easy 2 hours from Portland (104<br>
miles of freeway from the Columbia River), a long hour from Seattle (65<br>
miles from downtown), so don't let the distance keep you from coming.<br>
<br>
The Potluck should probably start a bit after Noon, to accommodate those who<br>
get a late start, and so we can enjoy NailHeads company.<br>
<br>
Check out the many boxes in the Thurston County area. Decide on which ones<br>
you are interested in,  I will have a map, can show you the 'best' way to<br>
get there and on to the next.  Guide services may be available :-0<br>

finding!<br>
