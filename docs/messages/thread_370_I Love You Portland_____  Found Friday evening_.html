How appropriate is it for this one to be hidden with our first official box on our wedding day!   So if anyone wants this one at the gathering they will need to find our Mudstumpers Mill Mystery box first, and it will not be placed until sometime after 1 PM on July 12th!  We will try have the clues posted by Friday night, the 11th.  Sorry! <br>

Since it came from the East Coast (and is glad it has :-) and has visited an East Coast gathering (with many stamps from that area, so you can match the stamp with the name :-), hopefully whomever finds it will save it for the upcoming Portland Area gathering (which I will unfortunately not be able to attend :-(.  <br>
<br>
Get out and find it!  The weather is great (except the day I placed it, it was raining :-(  If there is no message that it has been found in time for the gathering, will let you know where it is so that everyone can enjoy it!!!<br>
