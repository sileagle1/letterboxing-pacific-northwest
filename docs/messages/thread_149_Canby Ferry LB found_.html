with rambunctious kids in tow, that is!).<br/>

Wild Woman!!!  I'm so glad you guys found this box!  Were you the first<br/>
to stamp in?  The stamp is of the view of the ferry from the Wilsonville<br/>
side, but I couldn't do the directions from there because the ferry<br/>
isn't always in operation.  I tried to carve it from a photo from that<br/>
view.  I'm glad you and Heather and the kids enjoyed yourself.  Molalla<br/>
River is an excellent kid and dog running park to be sure!  I'm honored<br/>
and happy that you went seeking and found this box.  I hope others do<br/>
the same.<br/>
Funhog's Bluebird box is very nearby at Champoeg.  It's not a wimpy<br/>
drive-by like my box, but certainly a worthwhile stamp and hike.  By the<br/>
way...Did you take the ferry?  It was only $1.25 when we went a few<br/>
months back.  What a nice little trip through rural America.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

of the kids dropped the box &amp; it tumbled down the bank toward the river--but <br/>
I'm happy to report that it didn't make it all the way, so it's safe &amp; <br/>
sound--and dry--and awaiting its next visitors.)<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that we were fixated on that new stamp--we ran out there and <br/>
ran right back home--no extra time for a fun ferry ride, no Champoeg.  But I <br/>
want to get out there again to check out that Fir Grove trail (both for fun <br/>
and, of course, for possible future LB sites), when I have time for a longer <br/>
visit.  Thanks for getting us out there!<br/>
