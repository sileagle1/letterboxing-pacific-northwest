Hey..heads up! <br>
<br>
If you have a box located in a Tacoma/Pierce Co. park you may want to <br>
check on it. Yesterday (Saturday) was the Annual Park's Appreciation <br>
Day and many parks were scoured by volunteers picking up trash, doing <br>
maintenence and landscaping. I would hope that since this is the <br>
third annual one and many boxes have survived in years past that <br>
there would not be an issue but one never knows.  I began thinking <br>
about this when I saw that Titlow Park was on the front page of the <br>
local section today with photos of volunteers rebuilding hillside <br>
trails ruined by BMX bikers. I thought..omigosh...letterboxes in <br>
other parks could be found!! AKK!!<br>
<br>
This annual event is held every April (generally the third weekend), <br>
during previous years it was limited to a couple parks in the Tacoma <br>
system but they have really expanded it and the County has joined in <br>
on the program too. I know that Pt.Defiance was absolutely crawling <br>
with volunteers doing clean up since it's the 100th birthday of it <br>
this year. In years past (this is the first year we've missed it) <br>
volunteers concentrate on one park and comb it for garbage pick-up, <br>
spread gravel/bark on trails, trim bushes and such.  Now it is open <br>
to "groups" who want to focus on a park of their choice so many <br>
churches and organizations "adopt" a park for the day and concentrate <br>
on all kinds of mainentance. <br>
<br>
So..it's a nice day in Tacoma/Pierce Co if you have a box you may <br>
want to go check on it! Especially if it's located in <br>
Pt.Defiance..I'm going to go check on some of dvn2r ckr's today since <br>
she is on the other side of the ocean.<br>
