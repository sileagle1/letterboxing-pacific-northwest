<br>
I just realized tonight that I hadn't posted anything about this<br>
mini-event on this list, and that not everyone will have seen it on<br>
Atlas Quest.  Sorry about that!  <br>
<br>
Stormwind and I were married on July 7 of this year, and would like to<br>
invite our letterboxing friends to celebrate this event with us!<br>
<br>
We'll be holding the event this Saturday, September 15, in Cedar Hills<br>
Park in Beaverton.  It's located in the 2400 block of SW Cedar Hills<br>
Blvd.  After a short walk through the park, we realized there are not<br>
a lot of areas for permanent letterboxes. (I know some of you make<br>
take this as a challenge, though! :) Go for it!) Day boxes and plain<br>
sight boxes are more than welcome!<br>
<br>
We're doing a casual potluck, so please let us know if you can bring a<br>
dish to share, and what. I'll put up a list here as people rsvp.<br>
<br>
This is just an excuse to celebrate our happiness with our friends. No<br>
gifts, please.<br>
<br>
Other note: We are a same sex couple. If you don't approve of our<br>
marriage or our relationship, that's your right. But we're here to<br>
celebrate with our friends who are happy for us, so those of you who<br>
are not may wish to avoid this particular event. Seems silly that I<br>
have to even include this statement, but I'm sure we'd all like to<br>
avoid any unpleasantness.<br>
<br>
Sign up is on AQ at<br>

Hope to see you Saturday!<br>
