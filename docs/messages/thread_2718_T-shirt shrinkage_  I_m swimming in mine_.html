                    <div class="plaintext-content">I misinterpreted the sizing chart and got a T-shirt that is way too<br>
big for me.  I ordered a large in the green and would love to sell it<br>
to someone who wants that size or trade for a medium in green or blue.<br>
 That is unless someone has washed theirs already and knows them to<br>
shrink a fair amount.  The label says "preshrunk" so I'm thinking I am<br>
going to try to have to find a home for mine.  With sleeve<br>
outstretched my fingertips touch the seam that joins the ribbing and<br>
the shirt-sleeve.  The hem of the shirt itself comes to below my<br>
crotch - kind of a cute mini-dress if I added a belt and took off<br>
about 30 years from my age.  Just kidding, about THAT, but I'm serious<br>
about trading or selling mine to someone who wants it so I can get<br>
another if there are any available in my size.  E-mailing me off list<br>
would be fine if there is anyone interested.<br>

Tyra, you have done so much on this already - it was totally my fault<br>
for not looking carefully at the chart.  I will make sure you don't<br>
lose anything on this exchange and am happy to pay postage both ways.<br>
 Thanks very much!  Since you have both colors I'll take the blue<br>
medium.  Will put mine in the mail today or tomorrow.  I'll send to<br>
805 NW Alder Street in McMinnville unless I hear from you otherwise. <br>
Thanks SO much again.<br>

  Calli, send it back and let me exchange it for you! I have mediums in<br>
