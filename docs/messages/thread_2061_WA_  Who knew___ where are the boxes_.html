                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got back from this series late this evening.  It's pretty <br>
cool!  We found them all minus the one in the museum as it doesn't <br>
open until the 'summer season' (which begins Memorial Day Weekend, I <br>
presume).  I kept asking folks along the way who was responsible for <br>
the series and everybody pointed in one direction--to a very kind <br>
lady who works at the library.  <br>
<br>
So, we stopped by the library to thank her for taking the time, <br>
effort and resources to plant this neat series.  She was so excited <br>
about letterboxing and extremely enthusiastic about it.  Turns out, <br>
the library system offered a class on letterboxing a couple years <br>
ago and this series came about from that.  You'll notice that other <br>
libraries around the region also have letterboxes on the premises.  <br>
The class was to encourage children to learn about the libraries and <br>
discover something new.  Well, this ensuing series was really cool.<br>
<br>
Thanks to it, we visited several establishments that until <br>
this 'adventure' we'd only raced past.  We also hiked along some new <br>
trails that we hadn't yet visited.  Saw a glorious waterfall in the <br>
process!!!  We didn't complete the series in one day so we decided <br>
to car-camp for an evening and finish it up the following day.  Very <br>
glad we did that as the weather went from intermittent downpour to <br>
glorious blue skies with crisp, cool winds.  Perfect letterboxing <br>
weather!<br>
<br>
I urge ya'll to check out this series and support the establishments <br>
that are hosting the boxes.  Pipe up when you're there so they know <br>
you're a letterboxer.  Enjoy the adventure.  Hopefully, this series <br>
will encourage other regions to support this neat hobby, too.<br>
<br>
See you on the trail,<br>
