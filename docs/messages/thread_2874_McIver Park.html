                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another trip to McIver Park, on New Years Day.  This park is a <br/>
popular place for horseback riding and I ran into my share of <br/>
equine.  Also found some boxes and a hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
Coop's Heron in fine condition and well-hidden.<br/>
2nd Grade Ancient China, likewise.<br/>
2nd Grade Digestive System, also good.<br/>
<br/>
I especially appreciated Coop's Heron since the image is similar to <br/>
the cover of my new logbook.  <br/>
<br/>
Having been a newbie to this section of the park (if you read the <br/>
different clues for boxes in McIver, many them say "find the gravel <br/>
parking lot"), I was at first a smidge unsure I had the correct <br/>
starting place... because there has been a change that makes these <br/>
clues a bit inaccurate, for a while anyway.  No more hints.  If I <br/>
can figure it out, so can you.<br/>
<br/>
What is everyone else out there finding?  <br/>

Series and Lauries Eagle are recent finds of ours at the Kobayashi <br/>
Preserve.  The area is at the confluence of two sizable creeks, and <br/>
there was lots of evidence of recent salmon spawning.  Beautiful area!<br/>
Thanks Doubletree for the update at McIver...that is a place that I am <br/>
going to plan a whole trip down there around!<br/>
