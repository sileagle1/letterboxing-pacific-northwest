<br/>
Now that you mention it, Amanda--yesterday Heather &amp; kids &amp; I went after <br/>
"Squirrel's Delight"--and were delighted by this mystery box somewhere in <br/>
Portland.  It kept us guessing right up to the end &amp; so was quite a satisfying find.  <br/>
(Also a good place for the young 'uns to play, if you've got 'em.)  And hey, <br/>
whadda sweet little notebook--gorgeous!!!  Who is this Dellkra who placed it, <br/>
anyway???<br/>
