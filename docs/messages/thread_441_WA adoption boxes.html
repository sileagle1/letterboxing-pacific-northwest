Really a shame, such a sweet stamp.<br/>
<br/>
The hike up Rattlesnake was great.  I got Richards e mail from the <br/>
stamp log and sent him a note about the new registry.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp needs recarving.  One of the first LB's I have visited that <br/>
needs a new stamp log.  Many people who are not regular letterboxers <br/>
had signed in.<br/>
<br/>
Do go the next chance you get .  Allow 2.5 hours for round trip. ( <br/>
view time, sneaking into box time, its a busy trail)<br/>
