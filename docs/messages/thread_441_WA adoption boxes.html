rocks.<br>
Really a shame, such a sweet stamp.<br>
<br>
The hike up Rattlesnake was great.  I got Richards e mail from the <br>
stamp log and sent him a note about the new registry.<br>
<br>
The stamp needs recarving.  One of the first LB's I have visited that <br>
needs a new stamp log.  Many people who are not regular letterboxers <br>
had signed in.<br>
<br>
Do go the next chance you get .  Allow 2.5 hours for round trip. ( <br>
view time, sneaking into box time, its a busy trail)<br>
