<br/>
The family and I will be coming home for a visit in the Renton, WA<br/>
area and I wondered if there are any gatherings being discussed? <br/>
(I've been living in Los Angeles for 16 years, but the PNW still feels<br/>
like coming home :-))  It would be fun to see a few letterboxing faces<br/>
while we're in the area.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be at the Brown's Point Lighthouse for a family reunion the last<br/>
week of July.  Most of August will be spent in Renton, Ballard and<br/>
Ocean Shores.  I'm hoping to squeeze in a little side trip to some<br/>
Bellevue boxes too.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Would you happen to have an hour or two free during the Saturday of <br/>
the week you're at Browns Point?  That would be a neat spot for a <br/>
gathering--of course, it would be picnic on blankets or driftwood <br/>
type event since they're aren't many picnic tables there but still a <br/>
chance to get together and exchange signature stamps.  Otherwise, <br/>
I'm spending WAY more time than I ever wanted to near Ballard these <br/>
days, so a quick link up for an exchange during lunch hour would <br/>
always be possible with me whenever you're in the area if it's too <br/>
difficult to coordinate a gathering en masse.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well...dvn2r ckr you beat me to the punch!! LOL!! I'm sure that us <br/>
locals are always up to a gathering/event. We just need a reason and <br/>
now you've just given us one. My schedule itself is pretty  hectic <br/>
but if you could give me some dates I can work up a time to meet <br/>
with you. Weekend mornings/noon time are best for me since that is <br/>
when Officer MAB is asleep and I try to get the kids out of the <br/>
house so he can get his sleep (he works graveyard). <br/>
