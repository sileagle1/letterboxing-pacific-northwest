(Tacoma--North side of Commencement Bay) on the afternoon of <br/>
Saturday, 31 July 04 (2-4pm'ish)?  The park is a small lighthouse <br/>
facility with lightkeeper quarters, rolling hillside with garden and <br/>
surrounded by small beaches (depending on the tide schedule for the <br/>
day) and a few picnic tables.  This would be an opportunity to meet <br/>
with some letterboxers from Southern California (Spacy Holly &amp; <br/>
family)!  We could plan on meeting at the flag pole.<br/>
<br/>
There's only one letterbox on/near the premises but probably another <br/>
couple dozen or so within 10 miles of the park. <br/>

Unfortunately with the summer being upon us and Sim Kitty being out of<br/>
school and traveling with different family members we would not be able to<br/>
commit to anything until right before the gathering. I can tell you that if<br/>
we have Sim Kitty this weekend we will probably try to make it up there for<br/>
the gathering - if not we will probably pass and try to get some extra work<br/>
time in this weekend.  I am sure that Steve and Kris will be there and I<br/>
personally would like to give Sim Kitty a change to meet and play with the<br/>
Rayvenhaus kids!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can probably let you know for sure on Friday or so if you need RSVPs -<br/>
otherwise just count us as a big Maybe hehehhehe<br/>

<br/>
For folks who are unable to join us on Saturday, you could probably <br/>

letterbox around the Puget Sound region during the week so I can't <br/>

<br/>
It's a gorgeous venue so you won't be disappointed in spending a few <br/>
hours at the beach with an opportunity to 'dabble' a little bit in <br/>
letterboxing while you're there.  Oh, dogs are allowed.  Also, there <br/>
are a few other letterboxes just a few miles away from this park <br/>
(Dash Pt--think Trial N Error) so you can enjoy some other local <br/>
gems, too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there,<br/>
