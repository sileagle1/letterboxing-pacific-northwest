Hah! I wish I could've been a fly on the juniper when you<br/>
found that box... I drove by your house after I stamped<br/>
into Creepy Crawler but decided not to stop, chortling <br/>
as I thought of you finding my stamp before yours in <br/>
that letterbox. Sounds like I'd better get one of my boxes<br/>
down into the Redmond Dry Canyon before all the good <br/>
spots are scooped up!<br/>
<br/>
I did place the latest edition of the Crooked River Bridge <br/>
box this weekend, new stamp, new location... If you have <br/>
that old, old, old version in your logbook, it's time to look <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, the non-letterboxer in our household decided <br/>
he would like to go with me to find birder's Cyrus Springs <br/>
box. The lure of the dirt roads and remote location was the <br/>
clincher. Those old Oregon homesteads, with their stands of<br/>
Lombardy Poplars always remind me of my favorite book, <br/>
Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose. This is my very favorite <br/>
birder stamp, to date and the area is wonderful, one I'd like <br/>
to explore further. Funhog<br/>

Yeah, you got me. My first words were, "Funhogs already been here?!"  <br/>
I've already got the new Crooked River Bridge one on my list of to gets. We <br/>
are on vacation next week and I plan on getting a bunch that have been on <br/>
my list for some time now, one of which is Cyrus Springs and also many of the <br/>
ones out Camp Sherman way.<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>
