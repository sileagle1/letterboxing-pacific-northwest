                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there everyone, I sneaked (snuck?) our of work early today, and <br>
between rain showers, checked on my Picnic Basket letterbox at Oxbow <br>
Park, today.<br>
<br>
Box is in great condition, thanks to a Lock N Lock container.  For <br>
those of you who have visited it and remember how close it was to <br>
the river... think rushing water maybe 5 feet away.  The Sandy River <br>
has risen that much.  Amazing sight, if ya'll get the chance, take a <br>
drive by a local river and see how much it has risen from the recent <br>
rains.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the box is perfectly safe and dry, and several people have <br>
been kind enough to contribute Picnic-themed stamps to it.  Thanks <br>
to Lady B, Calli-K, Lily, Teata95, Hayler Sister #1, and several <br>
others that left stamps but apparently didn't say so anywhere that I <br>
could find.  There are a total of 16 stamps in the box, so plenty to <br>
enjoy, and a picnic table just a short ways away for stamping in <br>
(gotta get your heart rate up though, hee hee!)  <br>
