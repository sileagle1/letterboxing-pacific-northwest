                    <div class="plaintext-content">YAHOO!!!  PEOPLE, PEOPLE, PEOPLE!!! Our numbers for attendance at <br>
Saturday's gathering in Des Moines are now in the mid-40s (and <br>
that's from the folks who've contacted me--I'm sure there are others <br>
out there who plan on attending)!!!  Simply amazing for a long <br>
weekend when I presumed most people would be 'out of town'.  What a <br>
way to welcome our long distance visitor(s)!!!<br>
<br>
LETTERBOXING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AREA:  As for boxes in the area--<br>
there are currently no 'established' letterboxes in the park where <br>
the event is scheduled.  There are a couple of postage stamp parks <br>
near the venue that also don't yet have resident letterboxes.  There <br>
are a couple of different letterboxes/series hidden in the general <br>
area (within a couple of miles of the park).  One series that comes <br>
to mind is The Flight Path Series.  Another couple of letterboxes <br>
that are hidden within 10 miles include:  Anniversary, Dash Point <br>
collection of boxes, Brown's Pt Lighthouse, You Don't Bring Me <br>
Flowers, Glenn Hansen??? (it really has a different name but I can't <br>
recall at the moment), Deep Sink & Weasel and a bit further out <br>
includes the Turkey Dinner LB to the North and all of the boxes in <br>
the Tacoma area to the South.  I may be omitting some letterboxes in <br>
the vicinity as it's been a while since I studied the list--if <br>
anybody knows of any that I've omitted, please add them to the list.<br>
<br>
VENUE UPDATE:  we haven't officially reserved a pavillion or picnic <br>
tables for this event.  My plan is to show up about an hour early <br>
(2pm) to try to 'round up some tables' that will work for a group <br>
this large--anybody who wants to join me then is more than welcome <br>
to come!!!  This event will go on rain or shine.  If it rains, we'll <br>
just focus on the 'exchanging & eating' part of the event--still <br>
culminating with the arrival of our mystery guest.  I still don't <br>
think the renovations of the park will be complete by the time our <br>
event occurs, so we may have to resort to port-a-johns.  I plan to <br>
recon the park one more time tomorrow (if I can free up some time) <br>
to scout out possible hiding spots for new letterboxes.  Specifics <br>
for the 'location' for the event--we'll meet near the playground in <br>
the park.  As you enter the park, continue on the road past the <br>
first grass field/picnic area on the left--the road will wind to the <br>
right and you should see the playground and community activity <br>
center as you come around the bend.  There is parking near the <br>
playground and overflow parking in other parts of the park.  Not <br>
sure how popular the park will be on a Saturday afternoon of a long <br>
weekend.  If it's THE PLACE to hang out, then you may have to plan <br>
on parking a bit outside of the park and walking in to the event.  <br>
Hopefully, the park renovations will discourage folks from the spot <br>
so we'll have it to ourselves!  ;)<br>
<br>
I'll post one final 'update' for the event tomorrow on the big list <br>
& the LbPNW list.  Feel free to invite your friends and new <br>
letterboxers with whom you are in contact (those folks who don't <br>
know about the discussion board).<br>

See you then,<br>

Totally awesome Jessi!  Looking forward to the new people in the area, and the 'oldtimers' to be there, that we've <br>
not yet met. As far as exchanges possibilities go, this is going to be a target rich environment!  (grin)<br>
