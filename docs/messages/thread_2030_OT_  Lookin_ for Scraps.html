I'm the leader (okay, a co-leader) of a Girl Scout<br>
troop who will be planting a series of 12 boxes<br>
related to Girl Scouting during June.  We are using<br>
ALL recycled/scrap items for this series, including<br>
the boxes (in our case plastic jars), log books (tiles<br>
and old business cards).  <br>
<br>
What we need now are SCRAPS of carving material that<br>
are a minimum of 1.5 inches long/wide (this is a first<br>
carve for the troop).  We have enough to do personal<br>
stamps but not enough for the girls to make the stamps<br>
for their letterbox. <br>
<br>
Does ANYONE have carving medium that they are willing<br>
to donate to the troop?  One wonderful LBer already<br>
fulfilled our request and gave us enough for the girls<br>
signature stamps - THANK YOU LESLIE! - now I'm looking<br>
for additional carving material.  I've donated<br>
everything I have but we are still short.....HELP!!!!<br>

If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br>
