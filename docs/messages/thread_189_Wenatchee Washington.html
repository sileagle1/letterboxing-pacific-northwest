a stroller, but she loved it! NICE!  Very easy to follow and well <br>

stamping up that stood in the exact spot the box was hidden for about <br>
20 minutes.....  Figures that we were just making a "quick" pit stop <br>

that point!  All in all very nice! A great box!  Wingnut_LB <br>

You probably noticed a genuine lack of places to hid a box, and a lack of<br>
'stuff' to put over a box to hide it.  A drawback to Eastern Washington in<br>
