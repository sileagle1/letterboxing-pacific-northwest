some of the regions' lists of boxes have become quite unwieldy with <br/>
the appearance of many new letterboxes over time (i.e. Region 2).  <br/>
As we attempt to modify this 'megalopolis' a bit, there may be some <br/>
things that will help you better manage the site as it currently <br/>
stands.  Not sure if everybody is aware of some of the <br/>
www.letterboxing.org website's new features as they sort of appeared <br/>
without any fanfare over the past couple of months.<br/>
<br/>
Folks who register as members (don't worry it's free--I think it's <br/>
mandatory if you plant new boxes and upload clues) can go into <br/>
Member Services and activate 'flags' for boxes they've either <br/>
planted or found/attempted.  Then, you can change settings to 'hide' <br/>
these boxes you've marked as having already found or planted <br/>
yourself.  That feature alone cleans up the lists fairly quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Then, as you continue along your letterboxing adventure you can <br/>
annotate the statuses (stati?) of boxes you've found or planted <br/>
along the way--options such as 'found', 'attempted', 'ignore' (for <br/>
boxes you know you'll just never even attempt--like the ones that <br/>
require parachutes, crampons, EVA equipment or oxygen tanks).  This <br/>
feature will keep the status of boxes fairly updated (as folks enter <br/>
their finds/plants) and will also help keep your lists much smaller <br/>
over time as you find new boxes in various regions.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that might be nice is to have a 'Spring Cleaning' <br/>
event for the entire state to encourage folks to update their box <br/>
statuses (alive, needs repair, missing, retired--that sort of thing).<br/>
