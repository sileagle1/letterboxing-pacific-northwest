                    <div class="plaintext-content">It looks as though the initial rush of patch ideas has dwindled. I<br/>
will be creating a poll this weekend for everyone to select their<br/>
favorite entry. If you want to edit your post or add a new one, now's<br/>
the time to do it. Sunday, Jan 29 will be the last day for new or<br/>
altered pictures to be entered. The Poll will be posted on Monday and<br/>
will run for two weeks. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the current suggestions are great drawings but may have too<br/>
much detail to work well as a patch. They might have to be altered<br/>
somewhat to be useable. Also, if your design can use a solid<br/>
background color with embroidery on top of it, it would keep the price<br/>
down. Up to seven colors with 50% embroidery is the least expensive.<br/>
The pricing then goes up at 75% and 100%.<br/>
<br/>
Have a look at the links on Silent Doug's message #6310 on this list<br/>
to see what groups in other parts of the country have created. The<br/>
round ones are all 2.5 inches in diameter and the others are roughly<br/>
the same size. Although, I of course, think our area is by far the<br/>
best in the country, I think it would be a bit cheeky to make our<br/>
patches larger than everyone else's. Besides, Amanda has so many of<br/>
the dang things on her backpack, she'd probably have trouble finding<br/>
an extra square inch of space to put a large patch on. <br/>
<br/>
Keep 'em coming. We need your contributions... <br/>

My patch idea could probably be done on a beige or brown background<br/>
and would not necessarily need blue for the sky portion - that could<br/>
also be background.  Also, like I said before mine was hand-drawn<br/>
because I have no other way of producing something, and it was cleaned<br/>
up by funhog - anyone who wanted to alter it or clean it up further in<br/>
any other way is certainly welcome to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
Regarding price, I personally would prefer to pay more for a beautiful<br/>
albeit detailed patch than try to cut costs by eliminating detail<br/>
and/or color.  Just my own opinion of course, and funhog this is not<br/>
meant as criticism of your post; I realise you are just presenting the<br/>
facts.  Is there any way the company that will be producing the patch<br/>
could offer suggestions on the ideas that we have to choose from in<br/>
terms of what would work well and what wouldn't?  <br/>
<br/>
Sure are a lot of beautiful ideas - it will be difficult to choose.<br/>

California flag and thinks, "Woah!" (I'd use Oregon or Washington as<br/>
an example, but those flags are so boring, I don't actually remember<br/>
what they look like. If it weren't for growing up in California, I<br/>
probably wouldn't even remember the California flag.)<br/>
<br/>
But California's flag has a lot more details which, ultimately, takes<br/>
away from the 'symbol' it's supposed to represent. Heck, even the LbNA<br/>
logo is elegantly simple. If you try to fit in everything that's<br/>
representative of the Pacific Northwest--desert, salmon, Native<br/>
Americans, Oregon Trail, orcas, coffee, and whatever else you want to<br/>
throw in, it's going to be one ugly looking patch.<br/>

worked on today.  This one is more in line with the 'traditional' LBNA <br/>
patch concept as far as the lettering, colors (although my second hand <br/>
store Crayola marker blue just doesn't match the official 'prussian' <br/>
blue of the LBNA patch) and simplicity.  Includes a mountain and <br/>
treeline--even snuck in a raindrop and the north azimuth.  I figure all <br/>
the states in the PNW have at least mountains, trees &amp; rain in common.  <br/>
I really tried to pivot the azimuth to the northwest but I could never <br/>
get it to look 'balanced'.  <br/>
     But, honestly, I think the Pac NW is too quirky and unique to <br/>
stick with a simple patch.  We need bold, vivid colors with strong <br/>
images that send a powerful message to non-letterboxers the world <br/>
over!  ;)<br/>

the patch, something to identify us to other boxers but not draw the<br/>
attention of those who might not be quite so friendly toward our<br/>
hobby. Get out those markers, O Verdant One... Funhog<br/>

What are you talking about? You already posted a design for me. I<br/>
thought we discussed that already. =)<br/>
