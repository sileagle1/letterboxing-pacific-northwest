<br>
Sorry we can't meet up with you this weekend since we'll be out of town.<br>
<br>
You came late to the Roadhouse Gathering so you didn't have a chance to<br>
listen to the two rangers who were there speak.  <br>
<br>
PLEASE RE-THINK replacing boxes at the Nature Park because they will<br>
probably be yanked.  The staff at the Nature Park is totally in tune<br>
with our sport, but we must work in tandem with them.  They have yanked<br>
and still have many of my Rick's Farm series and at least one of Thom<br>
Cheney's letterboxes in their office.  <br>
<br>
If they have confiscated the LB's it's because they don't want them<br>
there, so replacing them will just cause the rangers/maintenance staff<br>
to go out and pull them again.  Funhog did such an excellent job of<br>
putting the gathering together and the diplomacy we've got going with<br>
the Nature Park people looks very promising.  I'm not sure they would<br>
appreciate replaced boxes after just meeting with us.  It might seem<br>
like we're disregarding all they discussed with us.  I'd like to keep a<br>
good dialog and ongoing positive relationship happening with these<br>
folks.<br>
<br>
Just my opinions after attending last weekend.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>
Amanda Briles<br>

Good thinking Paisley Orca!  I know that some of the boxes were removed because of <br>
their locations but some just disappeared on their own. Do you think Elisa would want <br>
to meet with Ryan for hiding the replacement boxes? Funhog<br>

The staff there already knows about these boxes.  Heck, last time I <br>
was out there, we were sitting out on a bench and were "caught" <br>
letterboxing by one of the park rangers who asked if we were <br>
letterboxing and if we were using the clues on the Internet.  And as <br>
I recall, Thom said walked around with one of the rangers while <br>
hiding the boxes.  They didn't seem to much care, though, and left us <br>
so we could continue stamping in.<br>
<br>
So replacing these boxes shouldn't be a problem, I would think.  As <br>
far as I know, none of the missing boxes were pulled by park rangers.<br>
<br>
But I'm not sure I'll have time to replace the boxes anyhow.  I've <br>
got a busy schedule ahead, and replacing those boxes aren't top on my <br>
list.<br>
