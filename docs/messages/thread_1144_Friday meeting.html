Not sure why you claim there are no letterboxes in <br>
Mississippi, since I have one there and I know of<br>
several more.  Also don't know why you say there are<br>
no beaches.  Last I looked Mississippi is on the Gulf<br>
Of Mexico with warm sunny beaches.  I think you will<br>
like it once you get used to it.<br>

Tomorrow it is! I'm looking forward to meeting Bindle Babe at 7:00 PM at<br>
this <br>
wonderful little neighborhood gathering place. The fact that the art on the<br>
walls is <br>
somehow related to my household has nothing to do with my opinion.  <br>
<br>
Laurelwood is a half block north of Sandy Blvd on NE 40th, within hollerin'<br>
distance of <br>
the Hollywood Theater and about four blocks north of the Hollywood Max<br>
station. It <br>
seems that the He Who Hikes the AT and She With Wings will be traveling from<br>
points <br>
north for the occassion. A couple of the local crew have said they'd be<br>
there, too. <br>
Anyone else I don't know about? Funhog<br>

Well...we plan on hitting the road by 5am. Since we are limited by a <br>
1pm latest departure time from Portland we figured we'd try to get a <br>
morning of letterboxing done down there in LB heaven!  So...we are <br>
open and I'll defer to you the Portland tourguide for guidance. Just<br>
give me a time and place and I'll run a "mapquest" search for exact <br>
directions. <br>
<br>
Let me know what boxes you think we should try for Saturday morning <br>
and I'll go ahead and run off a set of clues here. We <br>
enjoy "powerboxing" ...aka...the most boxes for our time!! It may be <br>
a couple more months before we get down south again.<br>
<br>
So...breakfast can be where ever jsut let me know what time you all <br>
will be ready. I can always fill time by hitting a box or two while <br>
we wait. (MomNoTime wants to hit Smith & Bybee and a particular <br>
mystery box.)<br>
<br>
So..what do you think?<br>

If you're looking for powerboxing before breakfast and then with us I would<br>
suggest the Gresham area.  We have LOTS of boxes, the Multi Hound Canine<br>
Collection, Playful Whippet, Circus Memories, Springwater Trail 1 and 2, A<br>
Rose by any other Name, Swan Lake, and Healthy Living Oregon are all within<br>
just a few miles.  Oops not to mention You Betcha and What Can I Get You.<br>
<br>
We have discussed either going up the Gorge Saturday morning or into<br>
Estacada.<br>
