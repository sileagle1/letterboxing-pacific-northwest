                    <div class="plaintext-content">Man, it was sooooo cool watching the Concorde come in!  First it flew <br/>
over Boeing Field for everyone check out, then looped around over <br/>
SeaTac and landed.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out it made a new record for a flight from New York to Seattle--<br/>
appropriate given the plane involved, I suppose of 3 hours, 55 <br/>
minutes, and 12 seconds.  Something to think about the next time any <br/>
of your board a plane between New York and Seattle and wonder why it <br/>
has to take so long.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Canada even opened a flight path over their northern territories <br/>
where the Concorde could break the speed of sound (usually a no-no <br/>
over land!) to make the record.  I just love international <br/>
cooperation.  *sniffle*<br/>
<br/>
Sorry none of you guys were able to witness the event with me, though!<br/>
<br/>
However, I'd heard rumors that the plane may yet fly once more....  <br/>
Supposedly they have to fly it to Renton to do something to it (don't <br/>
look at me, I don't know!) and fly it back to Boeing Field tomorrow <br/>
before it becomes a permanent museum piece.  So if you're driving <br/>
around the area, keep your eyes open for that piece of history.  =)<br/>

Farewell!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Did get to watch it in S--L--O  M--O while we <br/>
&gt; were parked on I-5 Southbound (for about 2 hours!!!) this evening <br/>
<br/>
lol!!!  The traffic on I-5 had been moving pretty well, but I swear <br/>
as soon as the Concorde came into view it completely and totally <br/>
stopped.  I even saw lots of people who had pulled over and got out <br/>
of their car (ON the freeway?!) to watch the festivities.  I was <br/>
incredulous that anyone would do something so dangerous.  *shaking <br/>
head*  But I suppose it's hard to get whiplash with all those rubber <br/>
necks up there.  =)<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, the plane got in about a half-hour early--much to my <br/>
delight since it meant I didn't have to wait around for an extra half <br/>
hour!  Wooo-who!  It was darned tooting cold outside!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Concorde did touch downs and fly-bys in Oshkosh, WI at the EAA.  It flew a bunch of people up to Toronto and back in about 45 minutes.  Watching her and the AirRaid demo including explosions was incredible, a day I will never forget.<br/>
<br/>
Though she is sleek and beautiful, the inside has a lot to be desired; very cramped, but a good compromise for time!  Too bad they are forever grounded.  Speedbird forever!<br/>
