Hi!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Just to let you know...I just had the Purple Heart Letterbox and I <br/>
mailed it to a Lber in New Jersey....but I did add the Mudstumpers <br/>
to the list after New Jersey....so I am sure the Mudstumpers could <br/>
add you to the list since I know it is on its way to them!!!  (I <br/>
hear he is still gimpy too!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Take care and happy boxing!!<br/>
Carie of the Lennen's 3<br/>
