I will be placing our first order for PNW Letterboxing T-shirts<br>
hopefully within the next week. They will be Gildan 6.1 oz long-sleeve<br>
in colors forest green, maroon, or royal blue. You can view the blank<br>
shirts and colors on Amazon at:<br>
http://www.amazon.com/sta6244-GILDAN-Cotton-Sleeve-5X-Large/dp/B000FVJYGA/sr=1-2/qid=1163966616/ref=sr_1_2/102-0861345-6482517?ie=UTF8&s=apparel<br>
(I know, that's a huge address.)<br>
<br>
The front will have a pocket-sized rain-drop-shaped logo with Lb PNW<br>
in it and the back will have the logo "Not all who wander are lost...<br>
some of us are letterboxing". After some discussion on the Oregon list<br>
and the Yahoo PNW Letterboxing list these seemed to be the preferred<br>
designs.<br>
<br>
I should have the shirts in plenty of time to ship for holidays. And,<br>
yes, you are allowed to buy one for yourself, put it under the tree<br>
and say it is from Santa :)<br>
<br>
The cost is going to be 13.67/ea (sizes S-XL) plus 3.00 for shipping<br>
in the U.S. The 2XL shirts are a dollar more. At this point, I'm<br>
taking pre-orders in colors and sizes. This is not a commitment to<br>
buy, but it will give me a general idea of how many, what sizes, and<br>
what colors to order. So if you are pretty sure you will want one,<br>
send me a note including your size, color choice, or any questions. <br>

<br>
I'm de-lurking to ask about shirts! :-) I'm pretty excited. I was wondering:<br>
what color with the logo and message be printed in? 'Cuz forest green with a<br>
logo in dark orange or brown is basically the "official" colors but toned<br>
down and reversed. Too bad they don't have a brown shirt--then you could<br>
print with dark green and be un-reversed (does that make sense)?<br>
<br>
Anyway--I'll definitely want to order two large shirts.<br>
<br>
Any chance we can get children's sizes? After spending 15 years thinking<br>
about letterboxing but not making time for it, I'm finally doing it this<br>
year and my husband and 3-year-old go with me. It's such a fun family<br>
outing!<br>
<br>
Also--I have a newbie, probably FAQ: what's "the Oregon list"--I'm in<br>
Oregon, am I on the wrong list?<br>

I looked at the shirts...great choice.  I think I really like the royal blue ones.  Are S-XXL the only sizes we can choose from?  If so, write me down for 2 smalls, 2 med. and 2 XXL.  If there is an exception, I would prefer to have 1XS, 1S, 2 M, 1 XXL and 1 XXXL.  Let me know if this is a possibility.  <br>
Also, what colors were the consensus for the logo?  Just curious.  Thanks for doing this.<br>
Take care,<br>
Melody<br>
