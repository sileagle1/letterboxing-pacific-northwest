My dearest friends,<br/>
<br/>
Quiet travelers from distant shores shall soon walk about our lands <br/>
of the Pacific Northwest in search of the perfect specimen of <br/>
Pseudotsuga menziesii and the the glorious crest of a white wave. <br/>
Whosoever willst welcomest these folk of fine repute in grand <br/>
fashion, please join us one `dies solis' during the month of the <br/>
snow moon in the 2004th year.  On the day of 20 and 1, abandon your <br/>
typewriters and join one, join all during the 15th hour beneath the <br/>
only pavilion at the lake nearest the aerodrome (less than one <br/>
league therefrom).  <br/>
<br/>
Bringest with thee victuals, refreshment, letterboxing materiel &amp; a <br/>
cheerful countenance.  Conversation, exchanges of signatures, <br/>
merriment and a new letterbox or two shall be provided.  The <br/>
youngest of thy clans are wholly welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
Help us welcome these weary travelers with the openest of arms.  <br/>
Until then, I bid thee well,<br/>
<br/>
the seeker of adventures<br/>

Alright, Pacific Northwest letterboxers! Get up out of your cozy <br/>
armchairs, drop those remotes, stop balancing your checkbooks and <br/>
come join other letterboxing aficionados as we welcome some out of <br/>
town `boxers to the Puget Sound area. Hitchhike if you have to!   <br/>
During the 15th hour of the 21st day of the 11th month, find us <br/>
beneath the pavilion near the shores of the angular lake where the <br/>
big birds come and go. Bring food to share and stamps to exchange.  <br/>
If you'd like to plant a box or two prior to the shindig, please <br/>
bring clues to share. The little ones are quite welcome as there <br/>
exists a small play area quite near the pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
You won't want to miss this one-in-a-million opportunities of a <br/>
lifetime meet-up!  Hope to see you there!  <br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Alright, Pacific Northwest letterboxers! Get up out of your cozy <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;armchairs, drop those remotes, stop balancing your checkbooks and <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;come join other letterboxing aficionados as we welcome some out of <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;town `boxers to the Puget Sound area. Hitchhike if you have to!   <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;During the 15th hour of the 21st day of the 11th month, find us <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;beneath the pavilion near the shores of the angular lake where the <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;big birds come and go. Bring food to share and stamps to exchange.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you'd like to plant a box or two prior to the shindig, please <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;bring clues to share.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;      <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;PEAS ON EARTH!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;The little ones are quite welcome as there <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;exists a small play area quite near the pavilion. <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;You won't want to miss this one-in-a-million opportunities of a <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;lifetime meet-up!  Hope to see you there!  <br/>

Hey, we'll be there Sunday to greet our mysterious visitors, will <br/>
you?  We successfully made it back to the US today (3 hours faster <br/>
than it normally takes on that route which was an added bonus!!!!).  <br/>
Now, if we can only adjust to the mega-time change before the big <br/>
shindig! Hope to see y'all there in a few days!  Peace, dvn2r ckr<br/>

&gt; Bringest with thee victuals, refreshment, letterboxing materiel &amp; <br/>
a <br/>

&gt; Help us welcome these weary travelers with the openest of arms.  <br/>

Ahhhh... now that the word is out, I can speak of the wonderful day spent with this <br/>
mysterious duo as well as the Verdant Reptilian and the Girl Sleuth. We spent the <br/>
night at the fascinating Olympic Hotel in Centralia and headed out after a steaming <br/>
plate of biscuits and gravy to Millersylvania State Park (a lucky thing, too, since the <br/>
next food didn't appear until after dark!)<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, Ryan and Amanda had copies of the clues from FF2 since many of the <br/>
letterboxes hidden in this lovely park don't seem to be posted in the usual places. We <br/>
found boxes created by Nail Head, Heather, Pandora &amp; Iron Bear, Pupp, Team Ware, <br/>
Bethany and Maiden and Amanda. The bounty was beyond belief. Many thanks for the <br/>
wonderful carvings, every one is terrific. Funhog<br/>

and others in that park as well, are available in many places.  Merely a <br/>
breakdown in communication I am sure.  I'm not a good critic of  our <br/>
work, I don't think it's good enough, though I've been told that the <br/>
Perfect  Peter's Pumpkins series was a awesome series and that the clues <br/>
were wonderfully written.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps one day you'll be able to visit the site and grab those <br/>
remaining boxes.  I would have loved to hear your thoughts on them.<br/>

&gt;Ahhhh... now that the word is out, I can speak of the wonderful day spent<br/>
with this <br/>
&gt;mysterious duo as well as the Verdant Reptilian and the Girl Sleuth. We<br/>
spent the <br/>
&gt;night at the fascinating Olympic Hotel in Centralia and headed out after a<br/>
steaming <br/>
&gt;plate of biscuits and gravy to Millersylvania State Park (a lucky thing,<br/>
too, since the <br/>
&gt;next food didn't appear until after dark!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Luckily, Ryan and Amanda had copies of the clues from FF2 since many of the<br/>
<br/>
&gt;letterboxes hidden in this lovely park don't seem to be posted in the usual<br/>
places. We <br/>
&gt;found boxes created by Nail Head, Heather, Pandora &amp; Iron Bear, Pupp, Team<br/>
Ware, <br/>
&gt;Bethany and Maiden and Amanda. The bounty was beyond belief. Many thanks<br/>
for the <br/>
&gt;wonderful carvings, every one is terrific. Funhog<br/>
