My dearest friends,<br>
<br>
Quiet travelers from distant shores shall soon walk about our lands <br>
of the Pacific Northwest in search of the perfect specimen of <br>
Pseudotsuga menziesii and the the glorious crest of a white wave. <br>
Whosoever willst welcomest these folk of fine repute in grand <br>
fashion, please join us one `dies solis' during the month of the <br>
snow moon in the 2004th year.  On the day of 20 and 1, abandon your <br>
typewriters and join one, join all during the 15th hour beneath the <br>
only pavilion at the lake nearest the aerodrome (less than one <br>
league therefrom).  <br>
<br>
Bringest with thee victuals, refreshment, letterboxing materiel & a <br>
cheerful countenance.  Conversation, exchanges of signatures, <br>
merriment and a new letterbox or two shall be provided.  The <br>
youngest of thy clans are wholly welcomed.<br>
<br>
Help us welcome these weary travelers with the openest of arms.  <br>
Until then, I bid thee well,<br>
<br>
the seeker of adventures<br>

Alright, Pacific Northwest letterboxers! Get up out of your cozy <br>

If you'd like to plant a box or two prior to the shindig, please <br>

Depending on your point of reference, the Snow Moon puts this event <br>
this month or next month.<br>

I would have been mighty lonely.<br>

Hey, we'll be there Sunday to greet our mysterious visitors, will <br>
you?  We successfully made it back to the US today (3 hours faster <br>
than it normally takes on that route which was an added bonus!!!!).  <br>
Now, if we can only adjust to the mega-time change before the big <br>
shindig! Hope to see y'all there in a few days!  Peace, dvn2r ckr<br>

Silent Doug & Jennifer from Pennsylvania!<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for welcoming them to the area in such grand <br>
fashion.  It was great to see everybody again and nice to finally <br>
see the faces behind the signature stamps!  Hope you enjoyed the <br>
little get together.  Silent Doug is the force behind <br>
www.letterboxing.info .<br>
<br>
See you all along future letterboxing trails...<br>

Ahhhh... now that the word is out, I can speak of the wonderful day spent with this <br>
mysterious duo as well as the Verdant Reptilian and the Girl Sleuth. We spent the <br>
night at the fascinating Olympic Hotel in Centralia and headed out after a steaming <br>
plate of biscuits and gravy to Millersylvania State Park (a lucky thing, too, since the <br>
next food didn't appear until after dark!)<br>
<br>
Luckily, Ryan and Amanda had copies of the clues from FF2 since many of the <br>
letterboxes hidden in this lovely park don't seem to be posted in the usual places. We <br>
found boxes created by Nail Head, Heather, Pandora & Iron Bear, Pupp, Team Ware, <br>
Bethany and Maiden and Amanda. The bounty was beyond belief. Many thanks for the <br>
wonderful carvings, every one is terrific. Funhog<br>
