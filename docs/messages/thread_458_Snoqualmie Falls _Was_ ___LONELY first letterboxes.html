Ya, I have 4 boxes (ok 3, one needs replacing) at Snoqualmie falls.<br>
<br>

<br>
I have #3 ready to replace, it's just such a mob scene there this <br>
time of year, I'd really prefer a weekday to re-place it.  Also, I <br>
havent even checked up on the Overlook box since I planted it.  I'd <br>
love to see who's visited it.  =D<br>
