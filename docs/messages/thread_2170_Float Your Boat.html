                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
Okay I talked to the guy at Liberty Lake. No They don't take <br>
reservations, however he did give me an option. I need everyone who is <br>
coming to please let me know what day they are coming. I also need a <br>
downpayment for the first night, so I can pay early in the morning to <br>
get the sites. It is $18 for tents and $24 for rv sites. We can cram 3 <br>
tents onto a tent site and they said if they run out of tent sites we <br>
can be put on an rv site. If you all could e0-mail me privatly, I <br>
could give you my address to send the down payment to. Tha way we can <br>
kind of reserve the spots. Thanks so much for your patientce with me. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to HomeSchoolMommy for putting on a fun gathering full of all <br>
sorts of letterboxing activities!  Liberty Lake in Spokane was a <br>
pleasant location with a great hiking trail for hiding letterboxes<br>
and there were plenty of them with beautifully carved stamps.  Also<br>
thanks to Thunderbird for teaching how to make a nicely bound <br>
logbook.  We really enjoyed meeting other letterboxers at our first <br>
event and look forward to future letterbox gatherings.<br>
