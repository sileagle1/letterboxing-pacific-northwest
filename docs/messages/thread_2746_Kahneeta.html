We are traveling from Bend to Kahneeta tommorrow. I have heard that <br/>
there are some "secret" trails from the resort to some of the springs. <br/>
Does anyone here know of them?<br/>

However, the land around the resort is all reservation land and I<br/>

land on the reservation side of the river around the confluence of the<br/>
Warm Springs and Deschutes Rivers. It's an old family inholding from<br/>
the 1800s. They are unable to use their land even though they own it!<br/>
Gun toting tribal police have actually ordered them off in no<br/>

effect protected from development by the tribes since they don't own<br/>
it and the current owners have no desires in that direction. <br/>
<br/>
There are several letterboxes along your way, though. There's the<br/>
Crooked River Bridge II, High Desert Tribute/Grasslands, Waterfowl<br/>
Highway and the Warm Springs Teepee. Hopefully, you'll have some time<br/>
to visit some of these goodies. Let us know about your trip. Funhog<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Funhog,<br/>
  It's funny I started out sending you a personal email thinking you would be the one who would know. <br/>
<br/>
  I seriously think I may have had a dream about hiking to the springs and was remembering it as someone telling me. I also think I have some strange connection to the area. Last spring we visited there and it was the first time I had been there since I was young. As I drove down into the area and saw the massive lodge/casino on the top of the hill my heart sank and I felt sick to my stomach. <br/>
<br/>
  We will try to catch a couple of the letterboxes on the way back. The Teepee box is at the museum and we won't have time for that one but I was definately planning on Waterfowl. The other two I had forgotten about, thanks! <br/>
