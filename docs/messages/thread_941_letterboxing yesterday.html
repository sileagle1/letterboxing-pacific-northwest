Camp Fire Lady for the terrific hunt. Although I do have to mention <br/>
that when I went to put the last box back that I smashed my finger <br/>
between the log and the rock as I was yeowlling (as only a whippet <br/>
can!) Bookworm proceeded to show me the scar on her shin from a <br/>
protruding stick further down on the log that nabbed her when she <br/>
first looked up the series a few weeks back. So just goes to show <br/>
what can happen when you are more excited about the stamp hiding <br/>
process than your own body parts! All in all we had a great day and <br/>
can't wait to go again!<br/>

I'm sorry to say that Battle Ground Lake Box #2 has been missing for <br/>
some time now. I have tried to contact the placer with no success. I <br/>
am planning on placing more letterboxes there since it just "screams" <br/>
for more boxes. Say, wouldn't that park make a great location for a <br/>
stamp-camp in the spring say around Earth Day? Anyway, thank you for <br/>
the comments about my Happy Postman series. That series seems to have <br/>
it's mishaps. When placing the boxes Cat's Meow had gotten her first <br/>
taste of stinging nettle right across the back of both legs with <br/>
shorts on. Ouch! We were also out in the downpour on Saturday. Do you <br/>
know how hard it is to walk through a forest with a huge golfer's <br/>
umbrella? Oh, the perils of letterboxing, but aint it fun!<br/>

 Of course, if it's really blustery, I'm sure you get quite a challenge hanging onto it and dodging natural obstacles too boot.     <br/>
