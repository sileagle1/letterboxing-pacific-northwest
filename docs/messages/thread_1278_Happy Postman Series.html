                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Goose for the update on my series The Happy Postman. I will <br/>
certainly replace the baggie for the soggy box. By the way, Cat's <br/>
Meow and I really enjoyed your boxes in Salmon Creek. I had been <br/>
eyeing that park for a while but have not had the time to plant <br/>
there. I have a series of 4 boxes that I was eager to hide but while <br/>
searching for the perfect hidey hole I stumbled across your box The <br/>
Egg. Not knowing how many more boxes were there, Cat's Meow and I ran <br/>
home to Battle Ground and grabbed or letterboxing supplies and <br/>
downloaded the clues and headed back to find your other boxes. Great <br/>
stamps! We really liked The Bunny. You had actually planted your <br/>
boxes the day before we went to plant ours. How funny. Now I need to <br/>
find a new location for my series. I think I will head to Battle <br/>
Ground Lake so keep your eyes out for more new planted boxes. By the <br/>
way, a new box has just been planted at a certain Library not far <br/>
away that pays tribute to a fellow letterboxing friend of mine. Check <br/>
it out!<br/>
