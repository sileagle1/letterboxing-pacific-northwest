HARD finding a good hiding place in downtown Seattle!  A total lack <br>

<br>
Anyhow, if you want to be sure of getting the box, sooner is probably <br>
better than later.  If you have some black electrical tape or <br>
something, feel free to cover the box with it to help hide it <br>
better!  (The letterbox is purple, but black or some other dark color <br>
might help camoflouge it a bit better.)  The next time I'm back <br>
there, I plan to do just that, but it might be awhile before I can <br>
make it back again.<br>

Just curious if you had time to find my Klondike Gold Rush <br>
microbox since you were in downtown Seattle?  Even though<br>
it takes some mining to get it, I still worry about it<br>
staying hidden.<br>
