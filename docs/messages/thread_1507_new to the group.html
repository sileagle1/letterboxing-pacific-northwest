I'm new to the group and to letterboxing, just started this Summer.  Anyway, I'm Amy and I live in Corvallis, and I sign as Scottish Amy, I also usually have my dog Teri- Anne with me she also has a stamp and notebook that she take with her when we go 'boxing.  <br/>
My roommate is the one who told me about letterboxing so we uaually go out together with the dog of course.  <br/>
<br/>
I am excited to say that I just planted my first letterbox at Bush park!! If anyone visits it let me know what you think.  It may need to be moved... just because it's in a popular spot and was hard to hide.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, I heard that there is a National Letterboxing get together... But I can't get on the site to see where it will be in my area... I would really like to get with other letterboxers and chat.  Does anyone know where it is or want to get together?  It would be fun to get a group and go letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you!!<br/>

Welcome to our sport! I was just in Corvallis this weekend, but<br/>
unfortunately didn't get a chance to do any boxing. Rat Pac has been keeping<br/>
it busy down there. I also have several boxes down there as well.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know anything about a national day, but we are hosting a large<br/>
gathering on August 27th in Battleground, WA (Just north of Portland) and<br/>
would love for you to come! Let me know if you need more information!<br/>

Welcome to the group!! As for 'gatherings' in your area, just keep reading <br/>
the list and you'll eventually see them posted. Or, you could plan one on your <br/>
own! Just pick a central location in a large park or something, post to the <br/>
list the time and date. Invite people to plant letterboxes in that area before <br/>
the gathering and just WATCH who comes out of the woodwork. We recently hosted <br/>
the GGGathering in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. There were 18 boxes <br/>
planted before the gathering and 37 people showed up!! Amazing response!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing!! <br/>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br/>
but good impressions. Sir B<br/>
