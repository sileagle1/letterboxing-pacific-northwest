postings for the past week or so, was really dissapointed<br/>
to miss your gathering in Tacoma this past Sunday!<br/>
I was introduced to Letterboxing by a local artist, she did the <br/>
Capital Moon Tree Series. It turns out her sister's a highschool <br/>
teacher and gave her class an assignment of creating a letterbox.<br/>
Some of them are...... shall I saw interesting! Have to admit I packed<br/>
the kids in the car and rushed over to Safeway in search of the "50 <br/>
cent soda" Letterbox, It sounded so easy. We left empty handed but <br/>
had fun looking.  <br/>
