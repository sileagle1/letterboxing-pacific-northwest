<br/>
Cool Pumpkin is  not available right now, it sounds like they have <br/>
decided to let that trail go until they get a new batch of UW students <br/>
to schlepp all the storm debris out.  Now it is unpassable due to <br/>
brambles and such.  There might be another way to the box...but I will <br/>
have to do some personal recons to find out.  <br/>
<br/>
My other 5 box series there, Sustainable Forest, is alive and well.  <br/>
The last part gets a little steep...but it doesn't go to the tippy top <br/>
of the trail....that comes later with more boxes!<br/>
