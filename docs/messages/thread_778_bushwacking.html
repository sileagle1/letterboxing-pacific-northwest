                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with Funhog that we should "stick to the existing trails."  But I'd <br>
argue that the Red Fox box is not on a trail established by the park.  It's on <br>
a "user trail"--one created by park users, taking shortcuts or having a look <br>
at what's over there.  Usually these trails are discouraged by park <br>
personnel--they often place logs/tree limbs across such paths in an attempt to discourage <br>
people from continuing to use them.  It bothered me to go "off trail" after <br>
that box--but I have to confess that I did it anyway. <br>
<br>
It's been some months since I've been there, but I'd bet that trail is still <br>
passable.  It was pretty well established.  That box gave Heather & me a tough <br>
time ("an upright log" is the phrase that I think is used--threw us for a <br>
loop--what the heck?  Not a tree, but an upright log???  Of course, when we found <br>
it we realized the description is accurate.)  I bet the kids just gave up too <br>
soon.  And I echo Mudstumpers' comment that the tree mentioned in the clues <br>
has fallen.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Nail Family went out on their very first geocaching excursion <br>
yesterday and we were amazed at how easily an area can get trampled. <br>
We found the cache in question not even near the tramplings.  I <br>
guess it had to do with poor satelite reception around trees and <br>
hills.  I am quite intrigued by gecocaching (almost as much as <br>
letterboxing) but if I do place any caches myself I will post <br>
coordinates to a very unmistakable location and make very direct <br>
clues as to the final hiding spot.  I think that there are many <br>
great adventure posibilities in caching but that there needs to be <br>
more creative effort in hiding and giving the clue/coordinates in <br>
order to minimize the possibility of bushwacking.  Maybe our year of <br>
letterboxing experience can aid in changing the tide of detrimental <br>
caching.  <br>
<br>
PS. dont worry, we arent giving up caching, we just got a new toy <br>
and want to take advantage of the many adventures near our home <br>
since we dont get to travel too much and we have found almost all <br>
the 'boxes in our home area.  We will continue to create letterboxes <br>
and strive to make them interesting, challenging, fun and exciting. <br>
Maybe by participating in both sports we can even help to convert <br>
some of the bushwackers into respectable treasure hunters too.<br>
<br>
<br>
Always the optimist,<br>
