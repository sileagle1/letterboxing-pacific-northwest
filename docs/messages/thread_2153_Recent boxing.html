the Higgin's Point Letterbox in Coeur d'Alene.  If you're ever in the<br/>
area, you absolutely *have* to take the time to get this box!<br/>
<br/>
It's in a perfectly lovely location, with great views of the lake. <br/>
(No hint there, it's all lake!  ;)  )  A very nice walk as well.  But<br/>
most of all, you have got to see this stamp!  It's hand carved, and<br/>
gorgeous!  Everyone I've shown it to so far thinks it must be a store<br/>
bought stamp.  Take some extra paper, though.  The log book (which is<br/>
also super nice) is full.  The placer is aware and will be replacing<br/>
it, so no worries.<br/>
<br/>
The same placer has one more box in the area that I didn't have time<br/>
to go find, sadly.  I will definitely hit it on my next trip.  If I<br/>
had realized it was the same placer, I probably would have gone for it<br/>
anyway, and just planned on driving home in the dark!  ;-P<br/>
<br/>
I also found the Sunshine box out farther east in Idaho.  It's a very<br/>
easy find, but a beautiful drive, very nice stamp, and so worth it! <br/>
Check it out too.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Next time, I'm planning way more time in my visiting schedule for<br/>
'boxing.  And planting.  Much of Montana is awfully bare of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone's enjoying this beautiful weather!<br/>
