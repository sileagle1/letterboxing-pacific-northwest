<br>
This isn't something we've been keeping track of but the local Cub Scouts are learning <br>
about LBing and asked me how many we have found. Just counted them up and...<br>
what do you know we finally hit the century mark with 105 boxes found. It took us a while <br>
but we are finally there. <br>
On another note, look for a new box soon in Central Oregon sure to be worth the trip. <br>
Spectucular views and a nice hand carved stamp!<br>
<br>
Later,<br>
