area near the beautiful Oregon Dunes, where there seemed to be a huge <br/>
void: Umpqua Lighthouse and India Series-1,2&amp;3. I have a fourth India <br/>
box yet to be placed. These stamps were carved for a summer art camp, <br/>
where I teach. Each year the focus is on a different culture, based <br/>
upon stories &amp; folktales from published children's books. It's such a <br/>
great experience. I enjoy the experience of witnesssing children<br/>
learn about a culture different than ours, hopefully making the world a<br/>
more tolerant place. I also always learn alot.<br/>
<br/>
Go get 'em! <br/>
