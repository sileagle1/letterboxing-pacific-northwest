                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thought I would start a topic.  I live in Oregon and only started<br>
boxing about 6 months ago.  I have just a few boxes out which are<br>
listed on AQ under Bun Traveler.<br>
My first boxes were regular stamps but now I am placing my carved<br>
stamps in all of them. <br>
<br>
I would like to discuss placement of the letterboxes in the wild. <br>
<br>
I have only found a few boxes.  Have been out to several areas near my<br>
home and only found a few because most of the listed boxes have been<br>
stolen or damaged with nothing left in the containers. <br>
<br>
Boxes have been placed on trails out in the open, in peoples yards out<br>
in the open and along bike paths where others might come across it<br>
easily.  The owners of the boxes are not thinking about the total<br>
picture here. <br>
I am not sure if others realize how many people there are in this<br>
world now that bike, hike and walk all over our states. <br>
<br>
Unless you are planting in the deep woods your box is most likely<br>
going to be found by just about anyone.  Most of those people are<br>
kids.  Or young adults that might know better than to be distructive<br>
but unfortunately they are. <br>
<br>
Placement is very important as to someone visually watching you find<br>
and replace as well.  If you can see someone on a trail or in the<br>
city---they can see you.  Curiosity will make them go find out what<br>
you just layed under some branches or set under a bridge. <br>
<br>
Let's talk about how we can place our boxes out of site and in areas<br>
where we can sit and take the time to stamp without having someone<br>
walk right up on us or see us while we are doing the stamping. <br>
How can we better hide these boxes?<br>
<br>
Also at the this time I would like to mention containers.  That can be<br>
another discussion if you like.  But it is a very good subject to talk<br>
about as well. <br>
What do you hide your stamp and journal in that won't get damp, moldy<br>
or basically damaged by animals.  Tupperware---plastic containers are<br>
not the answer for the PNW.  Let's put our heads together and start<br>
thinking of a good way to make our boxes safer, last longer and be<br>
long lasting while not littering up our environment at the same time. <br>
<br>
Looking forward to the discussions if there are others that have been<br>
thinking along the same lines.  <br>
<br>

that people DO think things through. Those same places that you are<br>
"complaining" about, boxes placed on bike paths etc, are ones that were<br>
placed there for a reason. There are thousands of letterboxers and<br>
letterboxes in the United States and each has a different idea of what is<br>
acceptable. It is true that some go missing sooner than others, but that's<br>
the way of the world. Placers soon learn how to better camouflage boxes,<br>
which trails will work and which ones will not. But, to open condemn<br>
people's choices is not helpful. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I would rather see a discussion on what WORKS. How many boxes have you<br>
placed, and what techniques have you used that you found worked? I<br>
personally have boxes that have been out there for 3 years now, on a bike<br>
trail, with no problem. I used small Tupperware type containers, hid them<br>
directly along the edge of the trail where they could be retrieved without<br>
to much fuss, and asked people to be discrete. So far so good. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
As for the type of containers, it is much more about how the boxes get<br>
sealed up than the type. I have boxes out there that are the cheap<br>
disposable sandwich containers that have held up just fine for 3 years.<br>
Books are nice and dry and cozy. <br>

Thanks for the discussion,<br>

I would also be interested to know what things people look for when finding a location.  I imagine a lot of it's pretty self-explanitory (someplace the box will fit, where it will be out of sight, distinct enough to explain, etc.) but what else do people look for?<br>
