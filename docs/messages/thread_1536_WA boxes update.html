                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a feeling that the 'contact the placer' feature on the LBNA <br/>
site is not working properly so I'll post updates on some WA <br/>
peninsula area letterboxes here since I have no other idea how to <br/>
contact some of these letterbox placers.  We found a handful of new <br/>
letterboxes and repaired or replaced a few of our own letterboxes <br/>
yesterday &amp; today.  All the Poulsbo, Silverdale &amp; Case Inlet <br/>
letterboxes were faring well.  Also, all of the Bainbridge Isle <br/>
boxes are doing well, too (who knew that that isle in particular <br/>
would attract dozens upon dozens of boxers??? when the neighboring <br/>
environs' letterboxes barely greet a dozen new letterboxers each <br/>
year?).  We replanted 'Uninvited Guest' as it appears <br/>
something 'demolished, decimated &amp; utterly destroyed' its original <br/>
hiding spot.  It's a new box, new stamp in a new location--same <br/>
scary clue.<br/>
<br/>
We also found Harry the Hermit alive &amp; well.  What an awesome spot!  <br/>
This is a place we never would have known about had it not been for <br/>
letterboxing.  We now have a new place we hope to further explore <br/>
someday soon--the tide pools were amazing! Reminded us of North <br/>
Shore, Oahu--only with British Columbia's mountains off in the <br/>
distance.  Unfortunately, no orca sightings this trip.  :(  A few <br/>
other awesome regional Olympic boxes were doing well, too--something <br/>
along the lines of a flattering crescent moon? Both just begging for <br/>
more visitors!<br/>
<br/>
Well, we're back to our non-letterboxing ways again for a while...<br/>

Almost forgot to mention that we attempted two letterboxes in the <br/>
Burlington, WA area, one letterbox in Bellingham and another on <br/>
Whidbey Island and are fairly certain they are missing.  The boxes <br/>
are:<br/>
<br/>
Pomona Grange<br/>
Friday Creek-- both of these must've floated away in last spring's <br/>
Skagit River mega-flood<br/>
<br/>
Sehome Arboretum (I don't think these clues are posted anymore)<br/>
<br/>
We also found the Joseph Whidbey letterbox gutted--unfortunately, <br/>
there was nothing but a letterbox container in the hidey-hole.  :( <br/>
We searched high &amp; low all around the hiding spot for anything that <br/>
appeared to be letterbox components but couldn't find a thing.  The <br/>
guts either went home with the vandals or are floating somewhere in <br/>
the Strait of Juan de Fuca. I'm not sure if the planters of these <br/>
letterboxes are active on this message board or not.  I'll attempt <br/>
to contact them individually somehow but wanted to shout out to <br/>
other letterboxers in the meantime.<br/>
