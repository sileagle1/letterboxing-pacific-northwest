trail. With the ghosts and goblins holiday on the horizon, it seemed<br>
the perfect time to seek out Ryan's Temple of Terror mystery box. I'm<br>
pleased to report that we were successful in our search. Although the<br>
box was plainly visible when we tracked it down, all the contents were<br>
as good as new. <br>
<br>
They were as good as new but not even close to actually being new.<br>
This box has been in place for over four years and we were only the<br>
second visitors! The last ones were there a few days after it was<br>
originally placed and were none other than the long silent Catbird and<br>
Lizard. Where have these folks gone? <br>
<br>
This box has a great stamp and is in a wonderful location. Lace on<br>
those boots, pack up some trail mix and be one of the lucky few to<br>
have it in your logbook... You will NOT be disappointed. Funhog<br>

camera batteries are charged! Four dollars may come in handy too,<br>
though it is certainly not required.<br>
<br>
PS As it is too late for me to come up with a clever anagram, there is<br>
no need to look within this text for such a hint.<br>
