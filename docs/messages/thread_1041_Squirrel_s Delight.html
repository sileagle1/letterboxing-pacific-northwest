the Squirrel's Delight box... I FOUND IT!  I'm pretty sure it was put <br>

The last 4 boxes I've found have been too small for me to drop off <br>
the hitchhikers I've been carrying around for 3 weeks.  We need <br>
bigger boxes out there!<br>

Hope you all had a great holiday.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congrats! I was thinking about you today when I was once again out looking for the Crystal Springs box.. no I didn't find it AGAIN, but my 4 year old got some fantastic pictures with his new camera.  After Crystal Springs we headed out to the Lewis and Clark State Park and picked up Silver Eagles box.  I didn't have my clues with me for the rest of them out there, so I'll have to go back again.  It was a beautiful day for boxing, sunny and just a tad bit cool.  <br>
