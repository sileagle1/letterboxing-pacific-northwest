There's a Calamity Jane's in Dundee now.  Is it the same outfit???  Does<br>
anyone know?  We had already eaten at the beach so we didn't stop for a<br>
bite there on the way back a couple weeks ago.  If it is, then, Oh<br>
Boy!!!  Then we'd have the best of both worlds, a great place to chow<br>
coming back from the mountain and coming back from the beach.  Can't go<br>
wrong!!!<br>
