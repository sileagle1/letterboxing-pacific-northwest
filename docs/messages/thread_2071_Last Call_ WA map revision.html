Hello everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I posted our latest WA map revision to the file section.  Please <br/>
review it and let me know if you see anything else that needs <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still looking for guidance on:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**  whether anybody will plant boxes in the near future in any of <br/>
the five 'unboxed' counties (those that are currently white on the <br/>
eastern part of the map--it's taken at least 3 years to get this map <br/>
updated so speak up now or wait another couple of years for the next <br/>
opportunity)  ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**  whether to separate Clark County out from its current region (as <br/>
its LB population has the potential to grow exponentially as that's <br/>
where lots of folks reside) and stand it up as its own region<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**  does anybody have heartburn with combining Thurston &amp; Pierce <br/>
Counties (quite frankly it's set up how it is right now purely for <br/>
aestethic reasons--it just looked unbalanced with 'tiny little' <br/>
Thurston County hanging out by itself AND 'Olympia' didn't fit <br/>
within its borders in that image; half of Pierce Cty is unboxable <br/>
with Ft Lewis &amp; Mt Rainier NP so I figured merging the two wouldn't <br/>
be as bad as having Pierce &amp; King Counties combined--as that <br/>
combined LB list went on for days)<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  I tried to add lakes to the map but it doesn't look good.  As <br/>
it is, Puget Sound is over-exaggerated just so it appears as water <br/>
and not land.  Any additional lakes/rivers would be too small to <br/>
even really show up.<br/>
<br/>
New Regions would be:<br/>
<br/>
1: Olympic &amp; Kitsap Peninsulae (is that correct for plural?)<br/>
2: South Puget Sound<br/>
3: North Puget Sound<br/>
4: Northwest WA  (this region's name is sort of funny as it's not <br/>
quite accurate--does something else fit better? perhaps Mt Baker <br/>
region or North Central WA?)<br/>
5: Cascades <br/>
6: Northeast WA<br/>
7: Southwest WA<br/>
8: South Central WA<br/>
9: Southeast WA<br/>
10: WA Mystery<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Barring any more comments from folks over the next day or two, we'll <br/>
submit this revised image for the LBNA site soon.<br/>

entirely or should we merge Clark and Skamania together?  Otherwise, <br/>
there will just be an 'island' of Clark smack dab in the middle of the <br/>
SW WA region. Combining the two counties would make it easier to look <br/>
at the map in toto. Not sure but as the hobby grows in popularity I <br/>
predict folks in Ilwaco would think it bizarre that they're regioned up <br/>
with Skamania (or vice versa) while it skips over much closer Clark <br/>
County.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a side note to this entire map revision process, here's some food <br/>
for thought:  Using Connecticut as an example, their entire state is <br/>
divided into four regions plus mystery boxes with about 2,500 boxes in <br/>
the entire state (in a really small landmass as compared to WA).  Each <br/>
region has approx 500 boxes each. WA state has about 800 'listed' boxes <br/>
TOTAL--with soon to be 10 or 11 regions whenever this map revision is <br/>
officially adopted.  Is splitting the state into this many separate <br/>
regions overkill in comparison to CT? Or is it just an attempt <br/>
to 'predict' an expansion in the hobby and be prepared for future <br/>
growth?<br/>
<br/>
What's at stake here is trying to balance the 'original intent' behind <br/>
the simplicity of the original LBNA map (and the Old World feel of the <br/>
entire LBNA website for that matter) versus form and function for <br/>
letterboxing as it grows in popularity in our region.  CT's state parks <br/>
and state forests system welcomes letterboxing with open arms, even <br/>
endorses them in many forms--so there are boxes in all sorts of nooks <br/>
and crannies there that wouldn't really happen (unless in my dreams) <br/>
here in WA.  WA parks and forests (except for a few awesome but rather <br/>
limited instances) haven't been so 'welcoming' of letterboxing--<br/>
although that could potentially change in the future with some future <br/>
judicious letterboxing diplomatic activism.       <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

at Clark county as the gateway to the Gorge and <br/>
including the Skamania Gorge boxes seems like a <br/>
natural division to me. It's something like the Portland <br/>
listing for Multnomah county which merges into the <br/>
Gorge on the Oregon side. In fact, I also think that <br/>
Hood county in Oregon should be listed along with <br/>
the other Gorge boxes but then there's a whole other<br/>
can o' worms. <br/>
<br/>
The overcrowding factor as seen in Connecticut <br/>
shouldn't really be an issue with the new features that <br/>
have been instituted at LbNA since you can set things <br/>
up to eliminate listings of boxes you've already found.<br/>
Then again, I guess a new letterboxer might be <br/>
overwhelmed. I just don't want the LbNA site to start <br/>
looking and acting like the geocaching site. I really <br/>
prefer simplicity. Funhog<br/>

Isn't #3 Seattle area, so why not name it as such?  We have never <br/>
considered Seattle as North Puget Sound because Puget Sound goes a <br/>
lot further up(see Note* below).  I wouldn't call #4 North Central <br/>
because to most of us in the area, that means Upper #5 area and Mount <br/>
Baker region could be West or East of the mountains. A good name for <br/>
#4 might just be North Puget Sound area or the Northwest Corner.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally would like to see Grant County (Moses Lake area) added <br/>
to #5 as it is North of I- 90 and seems more that part of Washington. <br/>

We'll go ahead and shade in Pend Oreille and Lincoln Counties.  <br/>
We'll move Grant County in with Region 5 if it makes more sense to <br/>
put it there.  Does anybody from the Moses Lake area have an grief <br/>
with doing that? ***I personally haven't spent much time there so I <br/>
don't know where the 'locals' think it should best fit.  My <br/>
experience in that region is about limited to stopping for gas in <br/>
Moses Lake on my way to Spokane/Coeur D'alene.  BUT that'll change <br/>
when the world's largest lava lamp shows up in its full glory!  ;) <br/>
Been waiting for that letterbox for ages already!!! ***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
New Regions would be:<br/>
<br/>
1: Olympic &amp; Kitsap Peninsulae<br/>
2: South Puget Sound<br/>
3: Seattle or Central Puget Sound<br/>
4: North Puget Sound WA <br/>
5: Cascades WA<br/>
6: Northeast WA<br/>
7: Southwest WA<br/>
8: Columbia Gorge WA<br/>
9: South Central WA<br/>
10: Southeast WA<br/>

Great Job!!!<br/>
<br/>
Region 5 advertises themsleves as 'North Central Washington' in their<br/>
advertising efforts and brochures.  It should be called NCW to match<br/>
their 'official' travel destination efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Region 3 should probably be King County or Seattle Area, Central Puget<br/>
Sound really has never shown up as a popular name for any area of the<br/>
state.  For official planning purposes, the Puget Sound Regional<br/>
Council inclues King, Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish Counties.  It makes<br/>
sense to put Kitsap County on the other side of Puget Sound for<br/>
logistic reasons. It also makes sense to put Pierce and Thurston<br/>
togehter.  Snohomish could go with eiter King or Northwest, Northwest<br/>
makes sense given the number of boxes in the two areas.<br/>
<br/>
Region 4 is commonly known as Northwest Washington, being the area<br/>
North of Seattle and West of the Cascades, and does not include the<br/>
Olympic Penisula.  <br/>
<br/>
Region 9, South Central Washington is an appropriate name, but you may<br/>
want to include Benton County, making the Columbia River the Eastern<br/>
Boundary.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be so late chiming in.  This is based on having worked with<br/>
the counties and having been here over 50 years.<br/>
<br/>
Dave<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

THANK YOU!!!  That's exactly what I was looking for.  I'm glad you <br/>
have a background in this--I forgot about the 'govt' connections and <br/>
all. ;)  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was pretty funny--I've been poring over maps, atlases and <br/>
dictionaries trying to figure out exactly how these regions are <br/>
labeled by the 'locals' because I want to get it right on the first <br/>
go 'round as we'll be out of the net for a long while again.  It got <br/>
to the point that I was even looking up formal government documents <br/>
from 1791 til now and then eventually researching the definitions of <br/>
words--such as 'sound', 'strait', etc to see where the <br/>
actual 'boundaries' of Puget Sound lie.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I faintly recall reading something (during letterboxing <br/>
treks/research over the last three years of course) about where the <br/>
Sound officially ends and the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Georgia <br/>
Strait begins but I couldn't quickly find anything about it on the <br/>
internet--that didn't deal with oenography/viticulture.  Now, I'm <br/>
thinking it was a kayaking the Sound guide--that broke down the <br/>
entire Sound by public/private beaches, puts-in, etc.  Of course, <br/>
when I need those guides, they're nowhere to be found.  ;)  Guess I <br/>
need a compass for my storage space these days...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input.  I'll modify the regions so they reflect the <br/>
official names.  By the way, glad to see you on the board again--<br/>
it's been a LONG while!!!  TOO LONG!!!<br/>
