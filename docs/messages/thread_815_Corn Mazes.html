If you haven't already been to a corn maze this fall, I highly <br/>
recommend The Farm's Washington State Corn Maze up in Snohomish!<br/>
<br/>
http://www.thefarm1.com/<br/>
<br/>
It is a lot of fun for kids and adults too! And you can learn alot <br/>
about the state of Washington. Watch out near the Hanford site!! :-)<br/>

I thought of that, but it is not practical. This is a field of corn <br/>
and it is cut into a maze only temporarily. It will be plowed under <br/>
and replanted for next year.  If you know the owners of such a maze <br/>
and they would let you leave a letterbox for the time that it is open <br/>
to the public, that would be great!<br/>

I've probably been to four different corn mazes, and every single one <br/>
of them has a different twist on it.  One of them had a dozen or so <br/>
checkpoints in the maze and at each checkpoint there was a picture of <br/>
the maze so you could try to memorize the way to the next <br/>
checkpoint.  (Which did not have to be acquired in any particular <br/>
order.)<br/>
<br/>
Another maze had four checkpoints in the maze, but absolutely no <br/>
hints as to where in the maze they were.  So you had to run around <br/>
randomly checking every dead end, turn, and twist until you found <br/>
them all.  Again, no "correct" way through the maze--whatever gets <br/>
you to the checkpoints and back out again.  (There's a lot of talking <br/>
to other people in this maze where you compare notes to see if <br/>
they've found a checkpoint that you haven't or vice-versa or what <br/>
parts of the maze they've already completed searching.)<br/>
<br/>
Another maze had numbers at key decision points in the maze that <br/>
corresponded with a numbered question on a sheet you got before <br/>
entering the maze with a list of multiple choice answers.  If you got <br/>
the answer wrong, it would send you the wrong way into the maze.  If <br/>
you got the answer right, it would send you in the correct <br/>
direction.  (The only maze I've done that actually had just one start <br/>
and finish and one correct way through the maze.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; running through the windy blustery corn in the dark. ooooooooh <br/>
&gt; creeepy!!! :)<br/>
<br/>
I did that once, and it's a hoot!  I'm jealous!  =)  Even better, <br/>
when I went, it was misty--not rain, but as close as you can get <br/>
without it being so.  It was wet and dark and a whole lot of fun.  <br/>
I've also heard of some corn mazes that have special Halloween themes <br/>
and they hide people with costumes in the maze that will come out and <br/>
scare you at night.  =)<br/>
<br/>
It's definitely a hoot.  http://www.cornmazes.com  And even if you <br/>
can't hide a letterbox IN the corn maze (at least not until they cut <br/>
it down and start over again after Halloween), you could probably <br/>
find a place just outside of the maze that will be safe.<br/>
