<br/>
Some of the Forest People (and a Wild Rowan) went looking for Who Let <br/>
The Dogs Out this past Sunday.  It started out poorly with us stopping <br/>
at the wrong trailhead.  We ultimately discovered that we had driven <br/>
past the correct parking spot to the next point at which the Wildwood <br/>
Trail comes close to the road.<br/>
Sitting on a sign post at this trailhead we noticed one lonely toddler's <br/>
sandal.<br/>
<br/>
After vainly attempting to follow the clues we ultimately worked our way <br/>
around to the trailhead we should have started at, and realizing our <br/>
mistake, started out again to find "Skip".  Now the clues lead us right <br/>
to him.<br/>
While stamping in at a nearby log making a convienent seat, we <br/>
discovered a second lonely sandal, the mate to the first!  Using our <br/>
best Sherlock Holmes deductive reasoning, we determined that these shoes <br/>
belonged to a young letterboxer, under 1 year old (no wear on the soles, <br/>
but scuff marks on the toes from crawling) who had been riding in a <br/>
backpack and also looking for Skip, Fido and Spot..  This young <br/>
letterboxer, wanting to leave a trail back to his/her point of origin <br/>
had kicked off first one, then later the other shoe.<br/>
<br/>
Our path took us back to the first trailhead where we reunited the two <br/>
little shoes.  After searching successfully for "Fido" and <br/>
unsuccessfully for "Spot" (where is that witness post anyway?) we <br/>
returned and retrieved the little shoes, thinking that a letterboxer <br/>
would be missing them, and might be reading this list.<br/>
We would be happy to return them to their rightful owner if possible, <br/>
but will donate them to Goodwill if we don't hear from anyone.<br/>
<br/>
So there you have the story of the Little Shoes.<br/>
