getting started ( presumed the start and really fought to make it <br>
happen where I thought it SHOULD BE)<br>
<br>
Lesson number 12345 for beginnners, relax and dont read too much into <br>
it.  Do not presume, be open to possibilities.<br>
<br>
I thought the last box was a challenging hide.  Cannot remember how I <br>
finally found it, but likely was an issue of brain drain.  I do <br>
remember having a challenge getting the exact spot narrowed down.<br>
<br>
Pt Defiance is still my favorite venue with all those wonderful trees <br>
and T&E and Glenns wicked fun boxes.<br>
