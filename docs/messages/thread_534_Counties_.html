way too much for my little pea brain to learn those in Washington too.<br>
It would be cruel and unusual for out of state visitors, too. Even<br>

winter. Funhog<br>

Also, locating the boxes in regions would make it less likely to miss someone's box in the same area but in a different county.  It has happened to us. Not that we don't plan to return to the area, but for those who may not be able to return......<br>
