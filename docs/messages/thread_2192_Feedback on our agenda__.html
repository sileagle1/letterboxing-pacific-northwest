                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
Well our trip is only 2 weeks away and we've compiled a list of <br>
potential hikes/boxes that we'd like to do.  We know we always print <br>
out a LOT more clues than we have time for, but we like to have <br>
options based on weather, etc.  We've got a big binder of clues and <br>
maps, but listed below are some that we really hope to do.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping some of you could give us some feedback (you can send a <br>
reply off-list) on our plans.  Where would be some good places to <br>
stay for some of these?  Gresham?  Carson, WA? Salem? somewhere along <br>
the coast for Tillamook boxes?<br>
<br>
We'd also love to receive some recommendations for your favorite <br>
restaurants.  We like seafood and all types of ethnic food.  <br>
