Chapter 5<br>
<br>
Sunday morning came and found me hung over again.  I woke up around<br>
10am and rolled out of my bed.  I decided that it would do me good to<br>
clean up a bit and spent the rest of the morning bathing, shaving and<br>
cleaning up my place.  I had some coffee, eggs, bacon and fried<br>
potatoes and left my apartment by 12:30.<br>
<br>
The drive down 99 to Chehalis usually takes about an hour.  Today it<br>
took almost two.  Too many Sunday drivers and a slow train at the<br>
crossing in Tenino.  I arrived at my grandfather's old homestead at<br>
about a quarter to three.  <br>
<br>
Berdevo, Buddy, Stealthboxxer had been many things in his 82 years of<br>
hard and laborious life. He had been a farmer, camp cook, carpenter,<br>
choker setter, log scaler, steam donkey operator, steam train<br>
engineer, and farmer again in his later years.  He was a son of a<br>
Greek immigrant and was born in Boston in 1856.  At the age of 17 he<br>
came out west to Seattle to find work in the logging business.  He<br>
found work as a cook with a logging company near Everett and<br>
eventually moved to Chehalis to continue his career in the logging<br>
industry around 1885.  He tried various jobs in the logging business<br>
and eventually moved up to engineer on a logging railroad that ran<br>
from the hills around Mt. St. Helens to the mills of Chehalis.  After<br>
an accident that ended his career as a railroad engineer at the age of<br>
57 he settled down to raise dairy cows at a piece of land southwest of<br>
town close to the railroad tracks.  <br>
<br>
My grandmother, Andrea, died of scarlet fever in 1902. Together they<br>
had one son, Logariazo , Logie Stealthboxxer, my father.  My father<br>
died in France during the Great War in 1915 at the age of 33, I was 13<br>
years old.  My mother died the next year apparently of a broken heart<br>
and I moved in with my grandfather, he was 60 at the time.  <br>
<br>
Buddy (like every other person who knew him I just called him Buddy)<br>
was a great man to live with while growing up.  He was as tough as a<br>
leather biscuit but he understood what a boy needed to learn to make<br>
it in the world on his own. He let me explore the world and experience<br>
a lot of mischief but he made me stay in school and encouraged me to<br>
go to college.  I left Chehalis at the age of 19 and enrolled in the<br>
University of Washington as a business major.  I dropped out two years<br>
later and drifted around for about ten years and had various jobs<br>
before getting into the private detective field.  <br>
<br>
Since the time I had left my grandfather for college I had visited him<br>
several times a year. His rough life had aged him early on so that he<br>
already seemed quite old since I had known him but he never seemed to<br>
age any more in all those years.  And he always had some wisdom to<br>
impart to me whenever I saw him.  He was a rock of stability in my<br>
maelstrom life and I had come to count on his advice whenever I had a<br>
tough decision to make.  He was old but strong and still took care of<br>
the farm on his own.  I had told him many times that he should think<br>
of selling the old farm and move into an apartment in town so that he<br>
didn't have to work any longer.  He had a small pension from the<br>
logging company that would support him if he would live within his<br>
means.  He would not hear of it.  He just kept on working and said he<br>
would probably die with a hay fork in his hand or at the milking stool<br>
and that's the way he preferred it. <br>
<br>
It had been several months since I had visited him.  My slim case book<br>
had limited my traveling money so I wasn't able to make the trip down<br>
as often as I had wanted.  He was very glad to see me when I found him<br>
in the barn loading hay bales onto a wagon attached to an old John<br>
Deer.  "Enigma, my boy!  I am so glad you came to see your old<br>
grandfather!  You are just in time. You can help me finish feeding the<br>
herd and then we can repair the south fence."  He always had work to<br>
be done and never missed an opportunity to take advantage of my labors<br>
when I was there.<br>
<br>
"Buddy it is good to see you.  Sorry it has been so long."  He hugged<br>
and squeezed the breath out of me.  <br>
<br>
"Come, help me with the hay."  I helped him feed the cows, repair the<br>
fence, cut some scotch broom from the south pasture, repair a window<br>
shutter, and split and stack enough firewood next to the kitchen door<br>
for about two weeks complete with a big pile of cedar kindling.  After<br>
the chores we sat down in the kitchen for a cup of coffee and a bowl<br>
of beans and ham next to the Franklin at a small wooden table he built<br>
himself.  Buddy subsisted mostly on beans, bacon, eggs, flapjacks,<br>
butter and milk, a high calorie diet that was a throwback to his<br>
logging days.  82 and no sign of slowing down in either activity or<br>
eating habits. <br>
<br>
"Well my boy, how is the private detective business these days?  Are<br>
you solving many crimes and making lots of money?"<br>
<br>
"Actually things have been very slow lately, Buddy.  The detective<br>
business is not very glamorous. Not like the movies. I haven't had a<br>
lot of cases lately and have been having a tough time just paying the<br>
rent."<br>
<br>
That was his cue. "Enigma, you should have stayed in college.  You are<br>
a very intelligent young man. You should be bank president by now. <br>
You should have listened to your grandfather."  Buddy had a fantasy of<br>
me finishing college and being a business giant.  Without fail he<br>
would remind me of my dropping out at every visit. It had gotten to<br>
the point where I just let it go and I didn't even bother to argue<br>
about it anymore.  It was our routine, he telling me how much he<br>
thought of my potential and then how disappointed he was that I didn't<br>
live up to his long failed expectations. He would usually end his<br>
monologue after a big sigh. " Ah, such a smart boy you were. So much<br>
potential. Oh well, we all make choices we regret. Tell me about what<br>
case you are working on now."<br>
<br>
Many times when I would have a tough case I would come and visit Buddy<br>
and talk about it.  He had fresh outside and objective perspective<br>
that could sometimes see the not so obvious things that I was too<br>
close to see myself.  He seemed to have a way of finding the simple<br>
and underlying truths in the complicated messes that I sometimes got<br>
involved in. For such a simple man he was very wise.  <br>
<br>
"I recently took a missing persons case.  A man has disappeared and<br>
his lady is paying me to find him.  I don't have much to go on but I<br>
have found some very interesting things that I am not sure are even<br>
related to the man's disappearance."  I told him all about the case<br>
and what I had uncovered so far.  When I spoke of McCaw and the<br>
logging company his ears perked up.  I figured that he would have been<br>
familiar with the McCaw Company being in the logging business for so<br>
long himself.  Since he seemed familiar with McCaw I asked the obvious<br>
question, "So, Buddy, tell me what you know about the McCaw Logging<br>
Company and their operations."<br>
<br>
"I know a few things about the McCaw company. They started up back<br>
around '95 up in Bordeaux. I knew a few good men who left to work for<br>
them.  A friend of mine, Davis McPhetridge, went to work for them in<br>
fact.  He left his job here at the railroad and was the fireman for<br>
their engine for a while.  His wife stayed here in Chehalis working at<br>
a laundry while he worked for McCaw and he would visit her on Sundays.<br>
 He told me of some strange things going on with that company. "<br>
<br>
"What kind of strange things?"<br>
<br>
"He said that a lot of good men had been killed in accidents in the<br>
McCaw operations.  Accidents happen frequently in the logging<br>
business, most men don't get through their career without at least one<br>
accident.  But this was different, he said that men were dying more<br>
often than usual.  He even said that one time 12 men died at one time<br>
in one accident.  Most of the men were not married and had no family<br>
out west so nobody seemed to care. He also mentioned that they were<br>
doing other things than just logging up there in the Black Hills.  He<br>
never told me what but whenever I asked him he would just smile and<br>
laugh a little and say, `It won't be long before I will be moving my<br>
wife to Olympia and she will be living in style. No more hard life of<br>
a fireman's wife for her.'  He never did move his wife to Olympia. <br>
She was killed when a log car derailed and crushed her as she was<br>
walking home from work along the line. After she died he stopped<br>
coming to Chehalis. I never saw him again."<br>
<br>
"So did you ever find out what was going on up there besides logging?"<br>
<br>
"I heard lots of rumors.  But rumors are just that.  When men are<br>
afraid of something they don't really know about they make up stories<br>
to justify their fears. Since so many good men had died in the McCaw<br>
operations word spread fast and soon no one wanted to work for them. <br>
However, they were paying more than most companies and some men found<br>
that tempting enough to conquer their fears.  I recall that several<br>
men had left the Centralia coal mine to work for McCaw.  About a dozen<br>
men were hired right out of the mine and left their homes and<br>
families, those that had families. It was told that they were hired to<br>
carve a tunnel thru a hillside for McCaw's railroad but the rumors<br>
were that there was really a mining operation going on.  A few months<br>
later those families were told that there had been an accident in the<br>
tunnel and all the men were killed.  Those families who were left<br>
behind in Centralia were paid a sum of money as a compensation and<br>
they soon disappeared mostly moving away to Seattle or Portland. <br>
However, I heard a story that one of those men was seen in Centralia<br>
several months after the supposed incident and the next day his wife<br>
disappeared.  Story is she left all of her personal possessions at her<br>
home and never showed up for work. Even left her wash on the<br>
clothesline.  Some said it was his ghost come back to kill his wife<br>
for cheating on her after he died.  Others say McCaw was secretly<br>
moving those men and their families to another town or another state<br>
to keep them quiet about their operations.  I think its just a bunch<br>
of bunk, myself.  I think the McCaw Company was just a very shoddy<br>
operation and lots of men got killed because of it. "<br>
<br>
"So you don't know of anyone who worked for McCaw who ever came back<br>
to Chehalis after working for them?"<br>
<br>
"Nope.  It was said around here that working for McCaw was like<br>
signing a death contract."<br>
<br>
"Hmm. I'd sure like to find someone who worked for McCaw and lived to<br>
tell about it."<br>
<br>
"Well, Enigma, you would need to be some kind of detective to find<br>
someone like that.  Enough of this talk.  Come, it is time for the<br>
evening milking.  You will help your grandfather."<br>
<br>
I helped him with the milking and then with several other chores<br>
before I said goodbye and drove back to Olympia.  Some kind of<br>
detective. I wondered at that point if I would get anywhere with this<br>
case.  <br>
