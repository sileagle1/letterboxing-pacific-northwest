Portland area.  Kudos to dv2rckr (and trkee, a rare treat to meet <br/>
the man finally!) and family.  Glad to see Fudrick and Hoopoe <br/>
again.  Really glad to meet strgzrmommy and girls as well as Pandy <br/>
and Ironbear, duende2u,  Wingnut and hubby.  And I will repeat what <br/>
has already been said before-- Team Ravenhaus Rocks!!! even if they <br/>
cant do math :) What a feast!  Thanks for bringing the gas.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had as much fun and me, Happy Mom, and Dan did today.  <br/>
Hope to see you all on the trails soon!<br/>
