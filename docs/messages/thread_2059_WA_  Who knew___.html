I'm on the road and don't have my atlas handy. This page would be very <br/>
useful when trying to convince park managers to allow letterboxing in <br/>
their areas. I have used the CT State Forest page before but it's even <br/>
better having a local venue to refer to. Funhog<br/>

It's actually USFS land, which borders NPS land, and the boxes show <br/>
up on the regional website that introduces visitors to the area--<br/>
sort of like a Chamber of Commerce site.  Can't quite figure out who <br/>
is responsible for planting the boxes--the email address goes to <br/>
a 'joint' effort Quinault Rainforest entity.  I'll check the boxes <br/>
out in a few days and try to meet the folks who put this together.  <br/>
A couple of years ago I planted a box at a regional interpretive <br/>
center out in Ocean Shores.  At first there was a little 'ire' at <br/>
the box being there but then when they realized that we spent almost <br/>
$200 at the visitor center store there, they welcomed the box &amp; the <br/>
hobby with open arms.  I'm wondering if somebody active in the <br/>
interpretive center in Ocean Shores encouraged folks in the Quinault <br/>
Rainforest to follow suit--as it will attract more visitors to the <br/>
region (that's been hit hard with the closing of several area lumber <br/>
mills in the past several years).  They even sell 'starter kits' at <br/>
the Visitor Center so people can get started right away during their <br/>
visits.  This is so cool that it's 'taking off' in the area.  I was <br/>
tiring of 'maintaining' my boxes in the area each trip--it's nice to <br/>
have something else to look for.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, the local library network has also sponsored <br/>
letterboxes within their libraries for almost 2 years now--so that <br/>
may be another way the word spread to them.<br/>
