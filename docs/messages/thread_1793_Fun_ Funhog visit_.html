We know we're in for a wonderful holiday season when it starts off <br/>
like this! We were contacted by email Tuesday evening by Funhog <br/>
saying she'd be in our area Wednesday and we were able to hook up!! <br/>
After stopping off at<br/>
In - N - Out for a burger (they don't have them in Portland, <br/>
evidently) she came to our house and we had a LOVELY visit! <br/>
<br/>
What a splendid individual! If you have found a Funhog box you know <br/>
she's a gem. But meeting her was even better! What a charming, happy <br/>
lady! <br/>
Thanks for finding time for a visit, Funhog! <br/>
<br/>
'Til we meet again (hope it's soon!!)<br/>

AHA!! So Funhog IS a woman! :o) I thought soooo...... Sandi and I <br/>
have been debating that fact (I win) I love it when I am right :o) <br/>
I think you might have blown her cover haha because she usually just <br/>
states she's just a hog which doesnt help because there are cute lil <br/>
girlie piggies and cute lil boy piggies out there. Mystery solved :o)<br/>
I am sure you might wonder why we would debate over this fact, but we <br/>
are very curious (No, not nosey) people :o) and we like to learn <br/>
about people through the stamps they carve and Funhog always leaves <br/>
beautifully carved stamps with very clean cut, flowing lines which <br/>
makes me think feminine, but I have learned that I cannot always be <br/>
biased like that because there are alot of really awesome male stamp <br/>
carvers out there too. :o) One of my favorites belongs to Don and <br/>
Gwen (dont know who carved it) "September Seagull" in Coos Bay, <br/>
Oregon. Anyways, Im dont rambling :o) Have a fabulous day!!<br/>

Hi boxers:<br/>
<br/>
I lurk on this list and have to respond about our dear friend, The Hog. Please be careful - Funhog likes to be referred to as genderless. Check out my questions to the Hog in our interview. I am mucho careful when talking about our favorite piggy in public or on our website.<br/>
<br/>
Sue and I, too, had the pleasure to meet with Funhog and agree that this is a most special person. Cannot wait until travels bring The Hog back to the right coast!<br/>
<br/>
http://funpig.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents - now I'll go back to lurking,<br/>
<br/>

Not to worry...it's only a game, after all. Just toast me with a <br/>
glass of champagne next time you wear that red hat! Maybe it's time <br/>
for that transgender surgery.Funhog<br/>

Oh, don't do that.  Most people THINK you're a man anyhow!  =)<br/>

Well, not that you look like a man, but people just ASSUME you are<br/>
because of your trail name.  If you change your gender, then they'd<br/>
actually be guessing correctly more often than incorrectly!  =)<br/>
