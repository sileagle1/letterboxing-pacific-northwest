  Whassup with the LBNW website?  I've been trying to log on, but the domain has been suspended.  YIKES!!!  Baby Deer and I are planning to head to Bend tomorrow and wanted to print off some clues.  We've printed some from the AtlasQuest site, but some good boxes (like Birder's Toy Box) are inaccessible at this time.  <br/>
<br/>
  Whatever shall we do with this calamity?!!!<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone know anything?<br/>
<br/>
  thanx!!<br/>

I am excited to get my husband and kids addicted to letterboxing, and thank<br/>

&gt;I have Big Tree (LaPine) and Pilot Butte (Bend) handy, if you want <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Pilot Butte<br/>
(I won't type the directions, I'll leave it up to you to find it, in <br/>
the middle of Bend city).<br/>
<br/>
Get to the top on a beautiful day<br/>
Drive or hike, however you may<br/>
Once at the top, be sure not to fall<br/>
Look for an aging Juniper with a short rock wall<br/>
It's old roots point the way to your treasure<br/>
Just a few short steps no need to measure<br/>
If you are still having problems finding this box<br/>
It may help if you look under some rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Watch for snakes!<br/>
<br/>
A note of my own -- I was in Bend a few weeks ago, and Pilot Butte <br/>
was closed until the end of July, for construction.  Let's hope the <br/>
Juniper and the box weren't disturbed.  Email me tonight if you want <br/>
Big Tree, not sure if you are going there.<br/>

&gt; Hi Kokopelli -- check your private email, I sent you a few Bend <br/>
area box clues that I had saved on my laptop.  Hope they help you.  <br/>
I'm afraid I don't have the Toy Box clues though.  <br/>
