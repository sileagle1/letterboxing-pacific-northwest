  Just a question about your posting, were you saying that some <br/>
people actually search for letterboxes purely to vandalize them? I <br/>
had no idea that there would be people out there that would do <br/>
something like that. I always figured that if someone takes the time <br/>
to locate an LB (and not found by mistake) that they would only have <br/>
letterboxing intentions. Hmm..thats really dissapointing that someone <br/>
might be that mean. <br/>
   Well I guess the Tortugas letterboxes are surely safe from this <br/>
kind of vandalism because it takes some serious dedication to reach <br/>
those LBs! :o) which can make them all the more rewarding :o) One of <br/>
my favorites belonging to the Tortuga is "On a lark" and when I show <br/>
my logbook to my family and friends it always gets alot of <br/>
compliments :o)<br/>
