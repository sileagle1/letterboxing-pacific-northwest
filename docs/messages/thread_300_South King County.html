At Dash Point, people were way out there, digging up interesting items, pypo boarding, and enjoying the sun.  The Beach Box is right where it should be, away from prying eyes.<br>
<br>
Brown Point is in good shape, especially if you are not compass challenged.  Another beautiful place to watch the boats go by, very relaxing.<br>
<br>
Previously had gotted the Campfire at Dash, was in good shape, with the Lost Hiker.  The Anniversary Box at Saltwater was there earlier this year, but was Feeling Sluggish.<br>
<br>
If you are heading up or down the I-5 corridor, this is a very rewarding detour.<br>
