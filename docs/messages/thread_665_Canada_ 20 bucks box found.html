Child &amp; I visited Victoria over the weekend--what a lovely time.  We went to <br/>
the area where 20 bucks is located solely to find the LB--and along the way <br/>
enjoyed a charming petting zoo and water-play fountain.  Ultimately, we ended up <br/>
in a wonderful little cove, where a curious seal bobbed in the water, a dog <br/>
named Thumper swam after the sticks we threw (Wild Child retrieved the ones that <br/>
Thumper missed), and kayakers glided by.  Yet another wonderful experience, in <br/>
a place we'd never have found on our own without a friendly LB to guide us.  <br/>
My LB-resistant friend was wowed and even promised to hit up some Seattle <br/>
boxes with us in the future.  <br/>
<br/>
MANY thanks to Canada Goose for the site &amp; the fun!<br/>
