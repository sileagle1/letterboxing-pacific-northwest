Well... MomNoTime and myself enjoyed another New Year's Day of <br>
letterboxing sans kids! We headed out to the Millers Place and <br>
decided to check out the fishing equipment that has been hidden in <br>
the area surrounding the lake. We found lots of interesting lures <br>
and lore. Only one lure couldn't be found but we let Chuck know that <br>
#8 was no where to be found or else we were completly off base. <br>
<br>
Heard rumors of ghastly beings lurking in the woods around there but <br>
we ran out of time to track any down as proof. So we will go back <br>
another day in search of wee beasties. We did check out a nearby <br>
home for hitchhikers that hasn't been visited in months. We are now <br>
helping a couple of stranded "out-of-state visitors" along their <br>
journey! We will drop them off later this week at a tourist trap <br>
somewhere in Pierce County.<br>
<br>
All in all...it was wierd to not spend the day mucking about in snow <br>
like we did last year. I missed my fourlegged companion dearly as <br>
she enjoyed our letterboxing foray in the snow with us last year. We <br>
are back on the letterboxing trail and ready to recarve a couple <br>
stamps for a couple of our boxes that have came up missing. Most of <br>
all we have figured out which boxes are going to be added to our <br>
found list this next month!! <br>
<br>
See you all on the trail sooner or later,<br>
MiniBullyMom & MomNoTime <br>
