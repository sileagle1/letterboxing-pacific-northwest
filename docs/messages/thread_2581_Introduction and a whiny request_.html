toddler and am bringing them without dad/hubby to the beach along with <br/>
my 69 y.o.Mom (fit), 11y.o. niece and the dog.  None of my group who <br/>
are capable (the teens) are interested enough to prepare by printing <br/>
out clues, collecting our maps and stamps, etc. so I am printing the <br/>
clues and getting ready.  I've printing out the clues on the Oregon <br/>
Coast between Tillamook and Cannon Beach from letterboxing.org.  <br/>
Searching this site gives me more info about the status of the boxes.  <br/>
To get the group hooked and get some momentum going, it would be great <br/>
to get an easy find or two under our belt right away.  Any suggestions <br/>
in that regard for the Oregon Coast?  Thanks much, Prettybutton<br/>

Sounds like an awesome holiday. Hope it goes very well. I am unable to<br/>
tell you about those boxes. We live in BC and have only found 1 Oregon<br/>
box along I-5.<br/>
Have fun boxing.<br/>
