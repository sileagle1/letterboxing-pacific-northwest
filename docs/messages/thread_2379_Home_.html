<br/>
I'm back!  (What?  You didn't know I was gone?  Hey!) <br/>
<br/>
After a semester in beautiful (unless you're freezing your butt off) <br/>
Boston, I'm finally home in Portland.  If you ever get out that way, I <br/>
highly recommend it, and not just for the letterboxing.  Though the <br/>
letterboxing is outstanding!  There are some wonderful indoor boxes in <br/>
Boston proper, perfect for winter or for tourists, since they're in <br/>
touristy places.  Also places with much security, so it's an adventure <br/>
not getting arrested (as I almost did), or seriously questioned about <br/>
terrorist activity (as I did, by a very scary woman - use caution with <br/>
letterboxes hidden inside buildings where you have to pass through metal <br/>
detectors and past armed guards before skulking around in dark stairwells).<br/>
<br/>
My one regret is that I didn't get a chance to hide a letterbox.  I <br/>
didn't get my carving tools sent out to me until the last few weeks, and <br/>
sadly, finals took precedence.  They also sucked every waking minute.  <br/>
In that vein, if you've sent me a private email in the last month, I'm <br/>
not ignoring you.  It's in my inbox, along with the hundreds of other <br/>
emails I'm currently sorting through.  If you don't feel like waiting <br/>
patiently, feel free to email me again, I check new ones first, before <br/>
going back to the beginning, just in case.<br/>
<br/>
I missed you all, and am looking forward to getting back to soggy boxing <br/>
here!  If anyone wants to go with me, I'd love it, I've had enough of <br/>
solo boxing for now.  :)<br/>
