don't have much time to elaborate but my LB website was hacked <br>
recently and everything basically lost.  I won't be able to upload <br>
clues/most current back up for quite some time (dec 04 at the <br>

letterbox clues if anybody is able to email me them--otherwise, I've <br>
got a backup of all clues and will attempt to 'recapture' the missing <br>
clues if anybody still has a copy of them.  Otherwise, this last set <br>

won't occur anytime before 2005.  Unfortunately, we lost everybody's <br>

I hadn't printed out these clues yet, but have you tried the Wayback <br>
machine? I think it's one of the greatest things since sliced bread: <br>
www.archive.org. <br>
<br>
I have a few printouts from your site, including comments, etc. Let <br>
me know if you need anything. No fears, I won't be throwing anything <br>
away anytime soon!<br>

Sorry to hear about your website, Bethany! =(  I'm glad you have<br>
copies of *almost* all of your clues, though.  It would have been much<br>
worse if you had lost ALL of your clues that, especially for<br>
long-distance boxes, may have never seen the light of day again.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to take this time to remind people to always back up<br>
anything that's important that you have on the web.  Someone,<br>
somewhere is eventually going to hack into it.  It's not a matter of<br>
if, but rather a matter of when.  And never rely on somebody else for<br>
backups.<br>
<br>
I mention this only because I know a lot of people post clues to a<br>
website--doesn't matter if it's letterboxing.org, geocities, or<br>
something else entirely--and assume that such websites will have<br>
viable backups or never get hacked.  And they might very well have it!<br>
 But nothing is more secure than having your *own* backups.<br>
<br>
I actually lost my website on geocities one time--which was shocking<br>
to me, because I expected them to have an extraordinarily reliable<br>
site.  It happened a long time ago, and I still had copies of all the<br>
data on my local computer, so it wasn't a big deal.<br>
<br>
I've also heard people say things like they're website wouldn't be<br>
hacked--there's nothing of value to hack!  It doesn't matter--people<br>
will hack websites just for the pure challenge of doing it.  They'll<br>
do it because they like to cause trouble.<br>
<br>
There is *always* someone, somewhere that's trying to hack into your<br>
website.  I log several attempts EVERY DAY of people trying to hack<br>
into Atlas Quest, though so far none appear to be very serious<br>
attempts and none of them have succeeded.  But I know that eventually,<br>
someday, it WILL happen.  There's no such thing as a 100% secure<br>
system, and it's important to be prepared to handle such an event. <br>
Because if you think it can't happen to you, you're living in a dream<br>
world.<br>
<br>
This message is *not* directed at Bethany--while her website being<br>
hacked might be a headache for her, she clearly had backups in place<br>
to restore all but one of her clues, and she deserves credit for that.<br>
 A lot of us out there wouldn't have been so well prepared, however,<br>
and this is a warning to them.  Don't let your website get hacked, but<br>
if it does, have a backup plan!  And *don't* rely on others for backups.<br>

I don't have much time to update you on my situation--partly work <br>
concerns, partly from limited internet/email access time (our work <br>
computers don't allow yahoo access).  Our site was attacked by some <br>
sort of a worm that attacks b-board type sites.  They posted <br>
their 'disease' to the site and then the worm somehow proceeded <br>
to 'devour' anything else that was posted there.  We backup the site <br>
fairly regularly, unfortunately, due to our living/working/multi-<br>
'home/office' location situation at the moment, we're not always <br>
able to 'get' to our computer(s) upon which the back ups are <br>
stored.  In this case, that may not happen for quite some time (as <br>
we're about to depart for a month-long trip to distant lands in the <br>
very near future).  The back up exists--just not sure when we can <br>
physically get to it if/before we depart.<br>
<br>
I've found a 'way around' the chaos at the moment in a remote manner<br>
(a method similar to sipping flowing molasses through a flexi-straw <br>
in Alaska in February), unfortunately, I just don't have the time to <br>
dedicate to rebuilding it via that method anytime soon.  I've tried <br>
to 'amend' the clues to those letterboxes of ours that folks may <br>
decide to visit in/around this weekend's event South of Olympia but <br>
otherwise, I can't promise anything else about our boxes.  For <br>
examples, some boxes we recently verified as missing--the site now <br>
lists as still there, some clues we've altered slightly, those <br>
changes are no longer there, that sort of thing.  For this I <br>
apologize profusely.  Life happens.<br>
<br>
I promise as our lives settle down sometime in the distant future, <br>
I'll try to work on this problem--until then I've got many, many, <br>
many more pressing non-letterboxing issues to attend to.  <br>
Sorry!  :(  Also, the LBNA links to many of the clues may no longer <br>
work--if you find yourself in that situation and still looking for <br>
clues, you'll have to go directly to the site.<br>

to make matters worse, the 'pointers' to all of our LB clues are now <br>

Hi All,<br>
I went in to dvn2r ckr's website and posted updates for all of the <br>
boxes that we have found recently (between 9/5/04 and 10/20/04).  I <br>
live in Olympia so most of these are in South Olympia.  I will also <br>
be at FF2 so if any of you think that your clues might not be <br>
correct just ask as I have printed sheets of all that I have updated.<br>
Looking Forward to Tomorrow!<br>
