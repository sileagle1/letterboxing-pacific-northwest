                    <div class="plaintext-content">Watch out for the commercial cruises.  Some are OK, but nearly all charge <br/>
hidden port taxes, and lots of them charge you for the "excursions" every <br/>
time you set foot off the boat.  I worked for an up-scale eco-cruise line, <br/>
and we heard stories about folks who went with such and such a cruise line <br/>
because it was so much cheaper.  But by the time they paid for everything <br/>
once they got there, it was very close to the same price as our <br/>
all-inclusive price.<br/>
<br/>
Also, and I know I could be biased here, but if you were to take a <br/>
commercial cruise to Alaska, of all places, a large cruise ship, IMHO, is <br/>
not the way to do it.  I always thought the reason you go to Alaska is to, <br/>
well, see Alaska.  But I can remember traveling in Glacier Bay or Tracy Arm. <br/>
We would stop the boat anytime we saw bears, whales, otters, moose on shore, <br/>
anything.  We would send passengers out on zodiac boats to hike on the <br/>
bear-free islands.  We would pass these huge ocean liners and see absolutely <br/>
nobody on deck because they were all inside gambling, eating, and playing <br/>
shuffleboard.  The rangers in Glacier Bay used to be amazed that folks would <br/>
come to Glacier Bay, only to watch the world go by on a closed circuit <br/>
television while they walked on the treadmill.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you don't take the ferry, and you consider a cruise line, consider <br/>
one of the smaller ones with smaller boats, say 50 - 70 guests instead of <br/>
2000.  They may appear more expensive on the surface, but there's the hidden <br/>
charges on the large lines.  And the small ones are, well, smaller.  They <br/>
can fit into delicate little places the behemoths simply cannot go.  They <br/>
carry a full staff of naturalists on board to help interpret the experience. <br/>
You will learn and experience amazing things.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents.<br/>

The cruise I took--which I figured was pretty normal for cruises--was<br/>
that they offered excursions you could pay for, or you could get off<br/>
and wander around your own for free. Unless I had a really compelling<br/>
reason to do otherwise, I'd be wandering around on my own. I don't<br/>
need no stinkin' tour guide. =)<br/>

<br/>
Nope, I'm thinking a smaller cruise ship for Alaksa is the way to go.<br/>
Big cruise ships have their advantages, but not in Alaska.<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, the prices I found for the ferry--you could get a VERY<br/>
nice cruise for those prices! It's absurd. *shaking head* I'd be<br/>
inclined to take a cruise if for no other reason than to protest at<br/>
the absurd prices for walking onto a ferry!<br/>
