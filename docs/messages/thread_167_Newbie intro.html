<br>
I'd like to start letterboxing.  I'm very excited about it and am planning on spending the summer traipsing around with my 1.5yo daughter looking for stamps and finding wonderful outdoor spots.  I've been working on my signature stamp (during naps!) and was thinking I was done until I went and looked at the stamps on file at the<br>
letterboxing-usa list.  Oooh boy - now I'm a bit daunted.  I'm not sure I'm even on par with the talented 12 yo!  I'd really like to use a hand made stamp, but don't want to make to poor of a first impression (so to speak!).  So, should I start a new eraser or let this one fly until it falls apart?  Which, by the way, shouldn't<br>
take too long.  I discovered that I accidentally undercut some of the raised areas - journey not destination!  I loaded the image into files.<br>
<br>
cheers,<br>
