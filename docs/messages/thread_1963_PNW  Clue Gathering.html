Thanks for putting this event on.  I had a great time meeting people<br>
and boxing too afterwards.<br>

It was great to see so many of my friends, and a real honor to make lots of <br>
new friends, too!  You were all such wonderful company for the afternoon!  <br>
Smiles and sunshine were both in abundance!  Oh, and by the way, the Clue stamps <br>
were beautiful, too!  Thank you for a fantastic time!  I love you all!!!!<br>

ditto to what everybody else said about the gathering!!!<br>
<br>
We just got home about an hour ago and had a great time despite <br>
being certifiably exhausted.  We bumped into more letterboxers out <br>
and about on the various trails today.  In fact, we linked up with <br>
Erfellie & Sandy a couple of times at different locations and even <br>
met up with another letterboxing family--who, unfortunately, didn't <br>
know about/attend yesterday's gathering.  It was a fun day!  We <br>
found a couple of letterboxes, too.<br>
<br>
Imagine<br>
Lewis & Clark in OR<br>
Sandy Delta<br>
<br>
We attempted Broughton's Bluff--but no luck--yet again. Our 3rd <br>
try!  We'll only go back up there with rock climbing gear next <br>
time!!!  ;)  We found a couple of boxes yesterday, as well--Mother <br>
May I #1 and Springwater Trail #2.  I think that was it for Sat <br>
besides the gathering itself.<br>
<br>
Thanks for another great get together and for the opportunity to <br>
meet so many folks who share the same passion for letterboxing as do <br>
we!!!<br>
