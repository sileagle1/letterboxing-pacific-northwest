&gt;   Just a question about your posting, were you saying that some <br/>
&gt; people actually search for letterboxes purely to vandalize them?<br/>
<br/>
Yep, I had about a dozen go missing just like this (in urban area <br/>
parks) and resorted to the last ditch effort of pulling all the <br/>
clues to my other boxes in the area off of the internet.  It seemed <br/>
to stop the problem before they vandalized them all but the mere <br/>
fact that it happened was VERY demoralizing.  I stopped planting <br/>
boxes for a LONG while after it happened.<br/>
<br/>
This is why so many folks are weary of introducing high school aged <br/>
kids to the hobby and the occasional newspaper article about the <br/>
hobby.  Not necessarily out of fear of what the 'respectful' high <br/>
schooler or average newspaper reader would do to the box but really <br/>
more out of fear the 'respectful' high schooler would tell their <br/>
perhaps not so 'respectful' high schooler buddy about the box's <br/>
existence and then that not-so-respectful kid and his/her other <br/>
buddies would go out on a binge to hunt/vandalize/destroy boxes in <br/>
the area.  On occasion, we've also had boxes filled with 'yucky' <br/>
stuff to which kids should not be exposed.  Yes, unfortunately there <br/>
are some downsides to this hobby occasionally. Thankfully, it's not <br/>
that common.  <br/>
<br/>
That's why camouflaging boxes is very important and locating the <br/>
perfect hiding spot helps, too.  Having a knowledge of where the <br/>
local geocache in the area is seems to help, too by trying to plant <br/>
the letterbox a great distance away from the geocache helps prolong <br/>
the lifespan of the letterbox as the geocachers who occasionally <br/>
stumble upon a letterbox don't have the precise hiding spot info for <br/>
the letterbox--they usually just leave it generally near where they <br/>
found it as their hobby doesn't require a specific hiding spot--just <br/>
a general grid square location.  <br/>
<br/>
That's also why I don't often leave 'sequential' clues in letterbox <br/>
series--for fear if one box accidentally falls into the wrong hands <br/>
then they'll have the clues to all the letterboxes in that series.  <br/>
No fun finding that the first box in a series is missing and knowing <br/>
that that first box contained the clues to the next box and so on.  <br/>
This is also a reason why I mix up my clues a bit, too.  I try to <br/>
include directions, pace counts, azimuths, terrain/plant <br/>
identification and some other 'loophole' bit of knowledge (like an <br/>
untranslated foreign term) in the most of the clues we craft.  Not <br/>
necessarily to be a pain but to make it a little more difficult to <br/>
find the box if you lack one of the necessary tools (compass, plant <br/>
id, prep research).  Then, if for some reason the clues fall into <br/>
the wrong hands, they'll at least need a compass, a dictionary or <br/>
internet access to quickly find the box.  Sometimes that <br/>
extra 'effort' requirement discourages folks from <br/>
damaging/vandalizing the boxes.  They'll just seek out easier prey.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, the hobby provides a lot more pleasure than the <br/>
downsides of it.  One just needs to know to expect the bad stuff <br/>
occasionally so as to not get too disappointed when it happens.<br/>

I'm very much a newbie to both letterboxing and geocaching- I've only<br/>
found one letterbox so far and it had just been badly vandalized, and I've<br/>
only been geocaching for 2 months.<br/>
<br/>
In the 100+ geocaches I've found, though, I've never found one that just<br/>
had a kind of a "grid" location- they've all had specific hiding places<br/>
they had to be returned to, or else they wouldn't match the cache<br/>
desciption or hint. Are there actually ones like that out there? Bleh,<br/>
I'll<br/>
never find them!<br/>

Here's an example. We're in a totally different region of the <br/>
country at the moment and yesterday we found a letterbox/geocache <br/>
hybrid.  The letterbox started out as a pure letterbox with specific <br/>
clues leading to it.  Six months after it was planted it somehow <br/>
turned into a geocache as well.  I'm not sure if the original <br/>
planter of this letterbox 'converted' it or if it was just adopted <br/>
by geocachers somewhere along the way.  Somehow it also ended up on <br/>
the geocaching website as a geocache with a completely different <br/>
name than the letterbox name. The original planter is no longer <br/>
available and the letterbox has been adopted by another area <br/>
letterboxer who did so just to save it from being discarded during <br/>
the website transition a couple years ago. The original clues <br/>
leading to the letterbox say it should be some 30 steps (15 paces) <br/>
away from where we actually found it.  The clues are rather specific <br/>
using plant and terrain identification in the clues but for some <br/>
reason the letterbox has 'migrated' some 30 steps (60+ feet) away <br/>
from its original hiding spot.  Not sure why-- but letterboxers with <br/>
the letterbox clues may never find it--because they're looking for <br/>
specific landmarks/plants mentioned in the clues.  Geocachers have <br/>
the grid coordinate from the entry in the geocaching page and once <br/>
their GPSr reads that grid then they sort of 'canvas' that general <br/>
area until they find the cache.  Yesterday, we were just giving up <br/>
on this letterbox when I noticed the tell-tale letterbox/geocache <br/>
stick altar beneath a bush.  Curiosity got the better of me and I <br/>
looked beneath the 'unnatural' arrangment of sticks and bark and <br/>
found what turned out to be the letterbox.  Reading through the <br/>
logbook, it had six months worth of letterboxers sign into it right <br/>
after it was planted back in 2002, then a flurry of geocachers <br/>
signed in/left cards/trinkets, and an occasional letterboxer stamp <br/>
appeared beyond that.  I think it had been about half a year since <br/>
the last letterboxer had signed in.  The only reason we even found <br/>
it was because the 'stick altar' caught my eye as we were heading <br/>
off the trail to return back to our car--otherwise, we would never <br/>
have found it.<br/>
<br/>
I was being a bit facetious when I said grid square (it's just a <br/>
term we use in the military)--I'm sure though that with the 100,000+ <br/>
geocaches located around the world, that there may indeed be one <br/>
with nothing but a grid-square 'hint'--I just don't have the time to <br/>
peruse the list, though.  ;)  <br/>
<br/>
GPSs are only as accurate as the number of satellite fixes you have <br/>
at any given time--the more fixes, the more precise your location on <br/>
the GPS, the fewer fixes, the less accurate.  Satellites have <br/>
different coverage times throughout the day depending upon what <br/>
types of orbits they use and what their 'true' purposes are/what <br/>
company's equipment you're using, etc--so depending upon when one <br/>
group of folks visits an area and prints up a GPSr coordinate--it <br/>
may differ a bit from when the next visitor is in the area using a <br/>
different GPSr.  Then of course there are different precision <br/>
levels, individual machine errors, and such.  Sometimes in geocache <br/>
clues, there's an additional hint that one must decrypt in order to <br/>
get more precise info as to where a cache is located--usually it's <br/>
there to help limit the amount of environmental damage caused in a <br/>
specific area (i.e. if you know the cache is near a 9' tall boulder <br/>
then you won't look around the small pebbles or bushes but limit <br/>
your search to the boulders).  In yesterday's case, the more <br/>
precise 'hint' was simply a link to the letterbox clue--even though <br/>
the actually box had been relocated some 30 steps away (60+ feet) <br/>
from its original hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
Just a different approach to a similar game--nothing more, nothing <br/>
less. By the way, our find yesterday was about our 70th geocache <br/>
find without using a GPS (no thanks extended to the jerk who broke <br/>
into our car at Pt Defiance Park and stole our GPS a few years ago)!<br/>
