<br>
Since I run both my own mail server and a website that sends out emails as<br>
well as a Yahoo group and I do this kind of thing for a living, I can give<br>
you the answer that I have found, although, please don't take this as an<br>
admonishment of Ryan's answer or anything at all.<br>
<br>
The bottom line as to why Yahoo group emails bounce is because of the spam<br>
filters that every ISP provides now.  Earthlink, AOL, etc, etc, etc, they<br>
all have spam filters in place to weed out the spam before it reaches your<br>
inbox and freeing you from the drudgery if having to wade through it<br>
yourself.<br>
<br>
So, what happens is this:<br>
<br>
As shown by the headers in the email that I am responding to:<br>

Yahoo does things so very differently.  Notice the "Received" lines above?<br>
 there are two of them, identifying that the message started at one<br>
server, and transited through another server.  That, along with the fact<br>
that it appears to the receiving mail system that this letter went to many<br>
different addresses, as it should, it is, after all, a mailing list<br>
letter, some of the more stringent mail filters will identify it as spam<br>
email and, in most cases, when it receives what it believes to be a spam<br>
email, it responds with a "User Unknown" response to the originating mail<br>
system, hoping that they will then remove the address in question (Yours<br>
for example) from their spam mailing list and thereby reducing the amount<br>
of spam mail you receive.<br>
<br>
When I was still a part of the LBNA mailing list, along with about 12<br>
other Yahoo groups, we would bounce regularly.  After troubleshooting this<br>
problem between my mailserver and Yahoo, with Yahoo's help, we finally<br>
managed to get it working 95% of the time, lots better than the every<br>
other letter bouncing back.  At that time, I was told by yahoo Tech<br>
Support, that the only email addresses they could guarantee would not have<br>
any problems with yahoo groups would be Yahoo based email.  (Go figure! <br>
:-)   )<br>
<br>
My website also had a similar problem with emails it was sending out, much<br>
like Ryan has experienced, though not with MSN, but with Earthlink, in<br>
that Earthlink was identifying the emails as containing a virus because<br>
the headers were malformed....  weeks of work between myself and Earthlink<br>
to resolve that one, but not before I got accused of trying to infect<br>
peoples computers. (chuckles softly)<br>
<br>
There are also one other thing that can cause Yahoo to mark your account<br>
as bouncing and that is a full mailbox, causing your mail system to refuse<br>
the email from Yahoo, which causes Yahoo to mark your account as<br>
undeliverable.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, there's not much you can do if the system is bouncing your<br>
emails because they have incorrectly identified them as spam.<br>
