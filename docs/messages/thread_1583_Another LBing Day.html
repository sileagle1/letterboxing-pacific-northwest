sun, and letterboxing.  Around 10:30a we hit the Camp<br/>
Fire box but much to our surprise....the sites were<br/>
full and there was no way around to get to the box<br/>
without crossing every single piece of rented space.<br/>
ARGH!<br/>
<br/>
We decided to forego the box and head to Timberline to<br/>
ride the Mile High Chair Lift to the top!  WOOHOO!! <br/>
We are sunburned but had a BLAST and took a ton of<br/>
pictures!  We ate lunch at home base then planted a<br/>
box (clues forthcoming).  This has been a spot I've<br/>
desired to visit since we moved here two years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, after some hiking we headed over to Ski Bowl<br/>
for a ride down the Alpine Slide!  The price is<br/>
highway robbery but it was SO MUCH FUN!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I figured the kiddo's could handle a trip around<br/>
Trillium Lake for a series of 6 of the same name. <br/>
Needless to say the disappointment of this hike was<br/>
great.  Of the six, we found two.  One was confirmed<br/>
lost before we started but that's not bad out of a<br/>
series of 6.  However, the clues were a bit muddied<br/>
for box #1 and that was not a great way to start. <br/>
Anyway, we grabbed box #2 (which was found left wide<br/>
open to be found by anyone and everyone) and used the<br/>
last available pages in the log book, #3 is confirmed<br/>
missing by us and also logged in as missing when we<br/>
hit box #4 which is still there and had a full log<br/>
book.  #5 was confirmed missing prior to our arrival<br/>
but what we found at box #6 was disturbing.  After<br/>
searching three places that fit the clues we came upon<br/>
what was a perfect match but there was no box. <br/>
Hmmmm....what are all these little papers ripped up<br/>
and laying on the ground.  Oh, and the lid to a letter<br/>
box.  Oh, and the bottom to a letter box.  Oh, and the<br/>
cover to the log book.  Yes, you guessed it -<br/>
VANDALIZED......how sad and disappointing.<br/>
<br/>
After that trip I was able to photograph Trillium Lake<br/>
with a mirror image of Mt. Hood in the water!  It's<br/>
postcard picture perfect and I'm hanging it proudly on<br/>
my wall!!!<br/>
<br/>
Well, it was late so we headed back to Rhododendron to<br/>
pick up Camp Fire.  Luckily MouseAttack has the eye of<br/>
a letterboxer and found it lickity split!  It was<br/>
great to pick up a stamp from a boxer we had never<br/>
found a box from before.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, we're back home after 12 hours of being<br/>
gone.  We planted, we stamped in, rode high in the<br/>
sky, came down the hill fast, and even played in the<br/>
snow on September 6th!  What an AWESOME last day of<br/>
summer vacation!<br/>
