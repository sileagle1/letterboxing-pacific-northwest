I love it<br>
<br>
now perhaps the borders/frame could be the raindrops, thus<br>
incorporating that element.(c'mon rain is part of who we<br>
are, is it not??)<br>
west + coast = rain  is that not the formula??<br>
<br>
I really like the fir branch,<br>
so indicative of the west coast and most every letterbox hiding spot??!!!<br>
<br>
now perhaps for SD's sake the orca should <br>
have a *starbucks* mug in hand??<br>
tee hee <br>
(just kidding!!)<br>

the Cascades where the average annual rainfall is less than nine<br>
inches! I like the branch because it could easily represent the<br>
juniper trees that are found in the drier parts of the states as well<br>
as the firs on the wet side. Volcanoes, too, are found all over the<br>
region. I have seen both whales and salmon while letterboxing and I<br>
have found letterboxes on an Indian reservation... What's not to love<br>
in all these designs?! Funhog<br>
