                    <div class="plaintext-content">I go to check on this box today, which I do every time I go to the<br/>
library, and I find this weird thing.  About a foot from the hiding<br/>
spot is a hole about five inches deep, six or seven inches in<br/>
diameter, pretty big really, dug with a shovel apparently, with a big<br/>
rock weighing down but not covering completely a stack of white papers<br/>
with print on them all about psychic readings and how you call this<br/>
number or whatever to get one.  No plastic around them, just loose<br/>
papers in this hole in the ground.  Whoever put them there also<br/>
grabbed a smaller rock (the one that was hiding my box from view) and<br/>
put it on top of the big rock weighing down the papers.  So my box is<br/>
sitting there in sight if one bends over, maybe not in sight if one is<br/>
just walking by - certainly not hidden well enough for a letterbox.  I<br/>
have no idea if the person saw my box and left it alone on purpose or<br/>
just grabbed the rock hiding it to use for their little cache and<br/>
didn't even see the box.  I brought box home and edited the clues; a<br/>
little too much weirdness going on in the vicinity for me.  I suppose<br/>
this is not too unusual for urban boxes.<br/>
