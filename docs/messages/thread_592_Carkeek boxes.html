<br/>
I met my first Geocachers at that box too. The box and Geocache are <br/>
near each other but separated by a thick line of trees and shrubs.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot remember who placed this particular box ( eliza or amanda?) <br/>
but perhaps it needs something obvious like a neon sign on it that <br/>
says "This is NOT a Geocache."  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you took all the trinkets and gave them to the kids.<br/>

That must be a common thing as we met a set of Geocachers on that same trail as we were heading back down from completing that run.<br/>
