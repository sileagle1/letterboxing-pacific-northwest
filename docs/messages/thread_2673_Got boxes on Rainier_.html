  Recent flooding has altered much of the landscape that is located in proximity to water.  Sunshine Point Park, for instance, is almost entirely gone now.<br>

  Somebody I work with has been doing a lot of work in the area (actually, a lot of somebodies...).  This PDF shows some of the changes in the Mt. Rainier area:<br>

  This can also serve as a lesson in placing boxes.  Even if it seems you're quite a ways from water, you might not be all the time!<br>
