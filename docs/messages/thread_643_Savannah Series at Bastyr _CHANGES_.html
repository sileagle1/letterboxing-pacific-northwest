her Salal before you get there anyway :)<br>

Thanks to Ravenmom who alerted usthat something was wrong (like the old<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Twilight-<br>
<br>
Feeling motivated today, so I packed up Ducky and Acorn to have a <br>
look-see for these boxes. And the day just got stranger:<br>
<br>
Box #1 Didn't seem to be there (yes, we're working with the updated <br>
directions). We figured we'd double back and look harder once we knew <br>
better what we were looking for.<br>
<br>
Box #2 Found the Mammoth right where he wanted to be, stamped in and <br>
tucked him away, covering him a bit better (the lid was quite <br>
visible).<br>
<br>
Box #3 On the way to the tree, we saw a LB lying out in the open by <br>
the path, a meter before the tree. Hmm, yup, the Impala was in it. <br>
And no stamp from Bethany--we figured we had found the lost box. But <br>
wait, the log book says it's a lion. Curious.<br>
<br>
Acorn has a look around the base of the tree itself, and finds a <br>
cleaner box with--an Impala in it. A replacement? Curiouser.<br>
<br>
Now, this is where we scratch our heads: We can't put the old box out <br>
in the open again, we debate about taking one home and sending it to <br>
you, but we can't decide. So we put *both* Imapalas in the well-<br>
hidden spot. We figure we'd let you know, in case you wanted to round <br>
one up again. (Not sure what to make of the Lion stamp in one log <br>
book...)<br>
<br>
(BTW, a fellow out walking his dog wanted to know if we were <br>
Geocaching--hard to hide the compass when you need it every few <br>
steps...)<br>
<br>
#4 Could not find this one. Smiled at the smiling log, looked high <br>
and low, nothing. Except piles of leaves, etc.--looks like things had <br>
been cleaned up recently (or since late August, when the last person <br>
stamped in) and the debris dumped behind this log.<br>
<br>
#5 Right where it should be, well-hidden, and we replaced it that way.<br>
<br>
On our way to #6, Ducky went splat, and the ensuing meltdown ended <br>
our trek for the day. We'll continue another day!<br>
<br>
So we found two of the supposedly missing one, and didn't find the <br>
ones that were there. Curiouser and curiouser...<br>
<br>
Thank you for the lovely series! Can't wait to complete it.<br>

Good to hear she's safe and getting better!!! (didn't hear about the<br>
surgery) -- hope the trend continues!<br>

Aha. Looks like the directions were altered to add the nurse stump, <br>
but the smiling log reference remained. Know exactly where to look <br>
now!<br>
<br>
Think we'll go finish off the series this morning.<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out with a friend and his 2 girls and we had a blast! it was <br>
perfect as there was no one out (at least initially) so the kids <br>
could be VERY obvious about what we were doing. Later there was <br>
another family that was letterboxing as well and they were right on <br>
our tails! First time that's happened to me. Anyway!...<br>
<br>
We found all of the boxes were safe and sound. The impala box (#3) <br>
sure enough had 2 boxes hidden. VERY confusing. (i didn't read any of <br>
these posts until now. i wish i had!) One had a blue impala stamp <br>
with the yellow lion logbook ( the original logbook). The other had a <br>
black impala with the blue impala logbook. So since we weren't sure <br>
if the lion stamp was going to be missing a logbook, we took it with <br>
us. We swapped the blue impala stamp and put it back with the logbook <br>
and kept the black impala with the original lion log. Phew! When we <br>
got to the lion, we decided to leave that box be and take the poor <br>
leftovers home with us. I was afraid they might go missing otherwise <br>
or confuse folks. Please send your address my way and I'll send them <br>
to you. We didn't know what else to do but that's what we did.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, we found that the clues for #4 and #5 were confusing. It <br>
seems that they both have a few sentences left over from when they <br>
were inside the groves vs. now outside the groves. Still found 'em <br>
though!!! :)<br>
<br>
Such a terrific series and wow! what fun to do with the little ones! <br>
The stamps are gorgeous and fun especially for me, the animal lover! <br>
Woohoo! Thanks!<br>
