<br/>
Feeling motivated today, so I packed up Ducky and Acorn to have a <br/>
look-see for these boxes. And the day just got stranger:<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 Didn't seem to be there (yes, we're working with the updated <br/>
directions). We figured we'd double back and look harder once we knew <br/>
better what we were looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 Found the Mammoth right where he wanted to be, stamped in and <br/>
tucked him away, covering him a bit better (the lid was quite <br/>
visible).<br/>
<br/>
Box #3 On the way to the tree, we saw a LB lying out in the open by <br/>
the path, a meter before the tree. Hmm, yup, the Impala was in it. <br/>
And no stamp from Bethany--we figured we had found the lost box. But <br/>
wait, the log book says it's a lion. Curious.<br/>
<br/>
Acorn has a look around the base of the tree itself, and finds a <br/>
cleaner box with--an Impala in it. A replacement? Curiouser.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is where we scratch our heads: We can't put the old box out <br/>
in the open again, we debate about taking one home and sending it to <br/>
you, but we can't decide. So we put *both* Imapalas in the well-<br/>
hidden spot. We figure we'd let you know, in case you wanted to round <br/>
one up again. (Not sure what to make of the Lion stamp in one log <br/>
book...)<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, a fellow out walking his dog wanted to know if we were <br/>
Geocaching--hard to hide the compass when you need it every few <br/>
steps...)<br/>
<br/>
#4 Could not find this one. Smiled at the smiling log, looked high <br/>
and low, nothing. Except piles of leaves, etc.--looks like things had <br/>
been cleaned up recently (or since late August, when the last person <br/>
stamped in) and the debris dumped behind this log.<br/>
<br/>
#5 Right where it should be, well-hidden, and we replaced it that way.<br/>
<br/>
On our way to #6, Ducky went splat, and the ensuing meltdown ended <br/>
our trek for the day. We'll continue another day!<br/>
<br/>
So we found two of the supposedly missing one, and didn't find the <br/>
ones that were there. Curiouser and curiouser...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the lovely series! Can't wait to complete it.<br/>

Good to hear she's safe and getting better!!! (didn't hear about the<br/>
surgery) -- hope the trend continues!<br/>

Aha. Looks like the directions were altered to add the nurse stump, <br/>
but the smiling log reference remained. Know exactly where to look <br/>
now!<br/>
<br/>
Think we'll go finish off the series this morning.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

&gt; #4 (i thot) had been moved from the smiley log to a nurse stump just<br/>
&gt; outside that particular grove -- but it's very late and i'll have <br/>
to go<br/>
&gt; check my notes and make sure the directions are right...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out with a friend and his 2 girls and we had a blast! it was <br/>
perfect as there was no one out (at least initially) so the kids <br/>
could be VERY obvious about what we were doing. Later there was <br/>
another family that was letterboxing as well and they were right on <br/>
our tails! First time that's happened to me. Anyway!...<br/>
<br/>
We found all of the boxes were safe and sound. The impala box (#3) <br/>
sure enough had 2 boxes hidden. VERY confusing. (i didn't read any of <br/>
these posts until now. i wish i had!) One had a blue impala stamp <br/>
with the yellow lion logbook ( the original logbook). The other had a <br/>
black impala with the blue impala logbook. So since we weren't sure <br/>
if the lion stamp was going to be missing a logbook, we took it with <br/>
us. We swapped the blue impala stamp and put it back with the logbook <br/>
and kept the black impala with the original lion log. Phew! When we <br/>
got to the lion, we decided to leave that box be and take the poor <br/>
leftovers home with us. I was afraid they might go missing otherwise <br/>
or confuse folks. Please send your address my way and I'll send them <br/>
to you. We didn't know what else to do but that's what we did.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, we found that the clues for #4 and #5 were confusing. It <br/>
seems that they both have a few sentences left over from when they <br/>
were inside the groves vs. now outside the groves. Still found 'em <br/>
though!!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Such a terrific series and wow! what fun to do with the little ones! <br/>
The stamps are gorgeous and fun especially for me, the animal lover! <br/>
Woohoo! Thanks!<br/>
