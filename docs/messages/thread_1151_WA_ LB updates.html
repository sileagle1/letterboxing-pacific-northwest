                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm double posting this message because a few regional letterboxers <br/>
no longer monitor the main LBNA message board--<br/>
<br/>
Made a few changes to some Tacoma area letterboxes:<br/>
<br/>
o   Both Defiant Animals Mystery letterboxes are missing and will <br/>
not be replaced.  Please throw out your clues to this series so you <br/>
don't wander aimlessly looking for non-existent boxes.<br/>
<br/>
o  Galloping Gertie LB is alive &amp; well (had several missing reports <br/>
over the past year)--I tweaked the clues a tad to reduce the <br/>
frustration level--although if you start from the correct spot it <br/>
really isn't that difficult at all.  A gimme, in fact... ;)<br/>

Since we'll be out of the country for April &amp; May, we have 8 weeks <br/>
left on the ground in the area and we're frantically trying to <br/>
repair, replace or retire our remaining letterboxes in the region--<br/>
thus giving us an excuse to go back and visit some of our favorite <br/>
spots in the region one last time. ;) I have this crazy idea to <br/>
replace all of the logbooks &amp; bags in the boxes before we drive away <br/>
in July knowing that we won't be able to return to the area as <br/>
frequently as we'd like once we relocate.  I've managed to replace a <br/>
handful of logbooks so far--only 100+ or so to go still. :(  Until <br/>
then, here are some updates for Puget Sound regional letterboxes of <br/>
ours:<br/>
<br/>
West Point Mule--alive &amp; well<br/>
Secret--alive &amp; well<br/>
Dolphin--alive &amp; well despite recent 'missing' reports--it's fine<br/>
Calkins Point--alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
Temporarily pulled for repair:<br/>
Buried Treasure<br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
Missing boxes converted to retired (please pull your clues):<br/>
Meadow Point<br/>
Gun Fight<br/>
Bread Batter Hat<br/>
Cold Moon Over Puget Sound<br/>
Burfoot Park boxes in Boston Harbor<br/>
It's Raining Animal Series in Olympia<br/>
Pine Cone &amp; Baseball in Lacey<br/>
New Market Falls in New Market<br/>
Goldfish in Olympia<br/>
Battle Point Birdie on Bainbridge (his buddy Fairy Dell Froggie is <br/>
still there)<br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
--retiring soon (June 06):<br/>
Bon Sigh Mystery<br/>
Little Fishy<br/>
Halitaeetus leucocephalus in Des Moines<br/>
<br/>
--potentially returning home to Florida in June 06:<br/>
Halitaeetus leucocephalus Exchange Letterbox in Steilacoom <br/>
<br/>
::<br/>
::<br/>
<br/>
WA boxes retired after going missing (beyond Puget Sound):<br/>
Bald Eagle in Rockport<br/>
Grays River Covered Bridge near Wahkiakum<br/>
Ocian in View! O the joy! in Wahkiakum<br/>
Fallen Rainbow<br/>
SamTONEHill'sENGE near Wishram<br/>
<br/>
So--hopefully this will reduce or eliminate any future frustration <br/>
folks might have when seeking out our Washington letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your letterboxing adventures...<br/>
