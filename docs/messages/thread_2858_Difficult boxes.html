<br>
Council Crest but only because the tree grew such that getting the <br>

<br>
Hidden Dragon. This one is notorious for stumping finders. It took <br>

Spirit of Dartmoor. A classic. It took me forever to figure out the <br>

As for boxes that are hard due to the hike, there are many but what <br>
really stands out to me are the Dog Mountain boxes. There are so <br>
many on the dog now that it makes the journey well worth it. Of <br>
course what really makes the journey worthwhile is the wildflower <br>
display in the spring. This is a trip that should be done by <br>
everyone who is capable.<br>

times than I can count (twice in one week last year ;o) but only <br>
because the Hog had informed me that my origanal search was not <br>
complete and I had missed 4 boxes up there made it worth going up <br>
again :o)  Let me know when you come to the gorge I would love to <br>
hook up and go hiking with you.<br>
