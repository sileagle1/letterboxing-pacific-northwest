Oh yeah!  Now that you mention it, Paisley, I recall the Mudstumpers saying <br>
they were waiting for a certain date to plant their first box.  At the time I <br>
figured it was solstice or Cinco de Mayo or something...apparently they were <br>
waiting for their wedding date!  <br>
(That's just cute as the dickens.)<br>
