 <br>
First, since finding the Road Trip LB last year, we have verified that it is indeed missing.<br>
 <br>
Second, we are happy to report that Classic Pooh is alive and well and in great shape.  Great Hide by the way and well done stamp!<br>
 <br>
Third, Obie is just where we thought it would be.  I even have a picture of the hidey spot and the water fall.  The Hurricane Creek Llama is a wonderful stamp.  In great condition too.<br>
 <br>
Thank you all for making the trip even more fun!<br>
 <br>
We have placed 2 of our own boxes in the Wallowa Lake area.  Clues will be added soon.  They are easy and child friendly.<br>
 <br>
In September we may place one up in the lakes basin of Eagle Cap.  It's a good long hike, Ryan.... are you up for it?  Or any one else who likes the back country??<br>
 <br>
Swat those mosquitoes!<br>

I'd love to, but I'm setting my heart on hiking the 90+ miles <br>
Wonderland Trail instead.  I hear it's beautiful out there!  =)<br>
