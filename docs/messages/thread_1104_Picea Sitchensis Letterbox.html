<br>
We attempted the Picea Sitchensis box on the 26th of December, and <br>
sad to say, we were unsuccessful.  Has anybody recently checked or <br>
found this box?  We will be back in the area this weekend, and would <br>
like to know.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ensure you have the new clues to the letterbox as I had to modify it <br>
when I found it missing about 5 months ago and replaced it with a <br>
different letterbox in a different location.  I am quite diligent <br>
about keeping the status of my boxes/clues accurate (I strive to post <br>
changes within 12 hours of making them/learning about them) so before <br>
you set out on hunts for any of our boxes, please ensure you have <br>
checked for any changes to the clues--unfortunately, I don't get many <br>
comments from folks about visiting my boxes (especially my 'orphan' <br>
boxes out there)--as soon as I get wind that a box may be missing, I <br>
post that info to the board if I am unable to clarify it further with <br>
the folks who reported it as possibly missing or if I'm unable to <br>
physically check on it in a reasonable amount of time.  Of course, I <br>
wouldn't rely on a missing report either.  Since my experience has <br>
been that for every missing report I receive, I'd guess that 30% of <br>
them are actually missing.<br>
<br>
Sorry for your frustration.  I hope you enjoyed your visit to the <br>
area despite not finding the box,<br>
