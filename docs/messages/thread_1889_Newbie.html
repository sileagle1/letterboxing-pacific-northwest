I'm planning to get involved in letterboxing it sounds like a fun <br>
thing to do with the family. My question is, is there anywhere to get <br>
a stamp made for you...I'm not very artistic, my hubby can draw, but <br>
I don't think hes up for carving. We are in Oregon.  If anyone knows <br>
of anywhere, or if anyone would be willing to do one for us let me <br>
know.<br>

I live on the coast, about 45 minutes from Salem...maybe about 1 1/2 <br>
hours to 2 hours from Beaverton. I may check that out if I don't <br>
think of anything else for awhile. <br>

If you want to sweet talk Iron`Bear into drawing something for you I would<br>
be more than happy to carve it. You can email him privately at IronBear at<br>

   If you don't find anything closer, check out<br>
PeddlarsPack.com.  You might be able to send your<br>
artwork on line. I'll be you could find something<br>
closer to home in the yellow pages though.  Have fun!<br>
