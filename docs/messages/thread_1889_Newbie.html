I'm planning to get involved in letterboxing it sounds like a fun <br/>
thing to do with the family. My question is, is there anywhere to get <br/>
a stamp made for you...I'm not very artistic, my hubby can draw, but <br/>
I don't think hes up for carving. We are in Oregon.  If anyone knows <br/>
of anywhere, or if anyone would be willing to do one for us let me <br/>
know.<br/>

I live on the coast, about 45 minutes from Salem...maybe about 1 1/2 <br/>
hours to 2 hours from Beaverton. I may check that out if I don't <br/>
think of anything else for awhile. <br/>

If you want to sweet talk Iron`Bear into drawing something for you I would<br/>
be more than happy to carve it. You can email him privately at IronBear at<br/>
phlsystems dot com - Good luck :)<br/>

<br/>
   If you don't find anything closer, check out<br/>
PeddlarsPack.com.  You might be able to send your<br/>
artwork on line. I'll be you could find something<br/>
closer to home in the yellow pages though.  Have fun!<br/>
