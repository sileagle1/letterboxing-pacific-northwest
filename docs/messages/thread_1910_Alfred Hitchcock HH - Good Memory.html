I'm really sorry to hear that, since that HH has special<br/>
meaning for me.  The first letterbox I ever found contained<br/>
Alfred.  It was in Spokane, WA and I brought it back with<br/>
me to Texas where I placed it in my very first letterbox<br/>
back in September, 2002.  There were no letterboxes near<br/>
me back then, and only about 10 in the entire state of <br/>
Texas, which is why a vacation to Spokane area provided<br/>
my first chance to see what letterboxing was all about.<br/>
What are the odds my first box would contain a HH<br/>
(which I knew nothing about at the time), let alone one<br/>
as famous as Hitch.  It prompted me to start placing my<br/>
own boxes, and the rest is history.  Thanks for helping<br/>
get me started!<br/>

&gt; Alas, but the Alfred Hitchcock HH that has lately been traveling <br/>
North<br/>
&gt; By Northwest is not MY Alfred Hitchcock. It is the Birds, Alfred<br/>
&gt; Hitchhiker created by Motofranz on 8/31/03. I have set it free here <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the Seattle area to continue it's travels! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to everyone who helped me get this Alfred. I fear that my<br/>
&gt; Alfred Hitchcock is gone forever. <br/>
