and it just happened to be on our 1 month Letterboxing <br/>
anniversary!!!!  WE JUST LOVE THIS!!!!  Love the walks we have been <br/>
on and love the parks we have found because of letterboxing!!!!  I <br/>
am addicted!!!!! My son loves to find them and my hubby thinks it is <br/>
great!!!!  I have learned alot here!!!!!  Just so you all know, our <br/>
stamp is MCKL!!!! ( Mark Carie and Kyle Lennen!!)  It is so fun to <br/>
find the boxes and see familiar names in the journals as I see on <br/>
here!!!!!  <br/>
thanks for the fun, hoping to plant one soon, Wing will be <br/>
encouraging me to do this, as we are LB buddies!!!!!!<br/>
Thanks<br/>
