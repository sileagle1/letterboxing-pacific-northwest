I had a good weekend finding letter boxing. After 2 tries I finally found, the 45th Parallel box, in Polk Co.  That one was fun!<br>
We, Teri the Hairless Wonder/Packdog and I, found 2 of the 3 history of Philomouth boxes but came up short on the 3rd box... aaaaccckkkk!!!  We looked and look but couldn't figure it out!!!<br>
Then we were back in Corvallis for the Beavers Box at OSU.  Meanwhile, I think Teri left a trail of hair everywhere we went....<br>
So all in all we had a great weekend .... looking forward to this one...<br>
Happy hunting<br>
