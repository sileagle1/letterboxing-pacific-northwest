<br/>
We made it up for a day and a half of the Silver Falls Gathering last<br/>
weekend! I had so much fun! This trip has only made me love<br/>
letterboxing more. The sights were beautiful, but unfortunatly we ran<br/>
into some camera troubles and had no way of taking any pictures!<br/>
<br/>
So I ask- Does anyone have any digital pictures to share? Not only of<br/>
the event, but from the whole park? I would love to see some, and<br/>
eventually print a couple out to glue into my logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
Becca <br/>
