interrupt?st=2&m=1&done=%2Fgroup%2FLbPNW%2Fmessage%2F3704) I'd like to <br>
urge you to pencil in the afternoon of Saturday the 10th to meet and greet the newest <br>
of the new letterboxers from the Longview Parks and Recreation class. So far there <br>
are ten new boxes planned for the venue and there are more to follow. Fudrick has <br>
done the honors and created an event stamp for the occassion. My fingers are <br>
crossed that he heals instantly from the eye surgery he has scheduled next week and <br>
will be there to unveil it in person.<br>
<br>
This place is great.  The staff there is 100% supportive of our visits and really excited <br>
about hosting these boxes. One of them begged me for clues so she could go <br>
hunting on her lunch break. I made a deal with her: she gets a stamp, she can have <br>
the clues... I will post directions to the park next week. I hope to see many faces old <br>
and new there. In the meantime, let's all send wishes for good health to our <br>
letterboxing buddies. Funhog<br>
