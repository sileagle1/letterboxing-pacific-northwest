OK - we're all set.. Please find attached the original plans for the day as<br>
well as clues for boxes that have been planted for the event. <br>
<br>
Please run them off and bring with you as we will not have copies available.<br>
<br>
We've had a few e-mails asking about food i.e.: pot luck and we think that<br>
is a cool idea. Soooo, if everyone wants to bring food stuff to share. We'll<br>
have a little BBQ and a camp stove but probably would be a good idea to have<br>
another BBQ.<br>
<br>
Any questions . drop us a note.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Using the map off the website for Derby Reach - you will want to go to the<br>
"Heritage Area" parking lot and from there walk towards and pass the big<br>
barn to an area with tables and away from the crowds. This could change but<br>
not likely. We'll all meet up somehow:0)<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing / meeting everyone!! Cross your fingers for good<br>
weather. But plan on good shoes, warm jacket and even rain gear.<br>

What?!  Are you trying to suggest that it rains in the Pacific<br>
Northwest!  Ha!  I'd like to see THAT happen!!  Erupting volcanos are<br>
one thing, but rain gear?  *shaking head* =)<br>

You know, for the longest time I didn't believe it ever rained in <br>
Washington!  We'd been letterboxing for several months before we <br>
ever had to don rain gear on the trail and that first hit us while <br>
boxing down around Portland/Vernonia/Banks area.  Then, it still <br>
didn't rain on us on the trail in WA for quite some time.  However, <br>
we did get hit by massive deluges letterboxing in DC/VA/MD/NJ/NY in <br>
Oct 02.  Those outings not only required raincoats but UMBRELLAS, as <br>
well!  How dorky!  But--the nice thing about boxing in the rain is <br>
that you don't have to be as discrete along the way, because NOBODY <br>
is watching you!!!  ;)<br>

<br>
Hello everyone and thank you for all the kind words following what we all<br>
consider was, "the first Canadian Gathering". <br>
Chris and I had a lot of fun planning - or should that be planting, prior to<br>
the event and apologize for the weather, but what can we say.<br>
<br>
Shortly after we confirmed hosting the event was when we got word that we<br>
would be taking an extended vacation and suddenly our lives - or at least<br>
mine did - became a bit muddled in the question of how to fit all of our<br>
"stuff" into a 20 foot container !@# What to take what to leave, who would<br>
take the koi, the placostomas, cockatiel - even my mother!!!!!<br>
<br>
Thus books, stamps and clues were set at the back of the burner. However,<br>
hope you all understood and I promise that when we host the first Barbados<br>
Gathering, the books and stamps will be top notch!!!! :0) Perhaps even as<br>
good as Ryans!!!! Hey Ryan, better start working on that event stamp now -<br>
and - saving your $ so you can come.<br>
<br>
We also enjoyed seeing everyone again and meeting some new people, we'll<br>
keep in touch and hope you all will too.<br>
<br>
Till we meet again on the boxing trail - happy hunting !<br>
Jane and Chris<br>
