                    <div class="plaintext-content">We really like the clueless letterboxes and the Mystery boxes.  It is so much more fun than just following directions to a spot.  But then again it is nice to be able to simply walk up and stamp in too!  We really like the diversity and choose accordingly.  <br/>
<br/>
We are already planning a clueless box, a mystery box and a series of our own.  Some will challenge the mind, some, the eyes, and some will be nice and easy.  <br/>
<br/>
The point is that there is an appeal to a variety of letterboxers.  If you want the stamp of a difficult search, I'm sure there are those who would be happy to provide hints and or additional clues off the talk list either from the placer or someone who has found it.  Then again there are some that may "stump" you forever.  We will eventually prevail at Murder in Gabriel Park,  for example, we are short 2 stamps there,  we will just go elsewhere and occasionally go back and hunt some more. Same thing with clueless boxes,  usually a search on the internet will get you started in the right direction, and then be persistant.  This type of search is at least educational/fun. What we dislike is hunting through the threads to find out if a box even exists before we go hunting for it.  If its in the clue page, there should be a box there.<br/>
<br/>
But you cannot please everyone, eh!       <br/>
