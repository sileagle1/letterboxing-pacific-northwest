Chapter 7<br/>
<br/>
Davis McPhetridge Jr. was not at first glance a wealthy man but he<br/>
lived a fairly comfortable life on a small farm adjacent to the old<br/>
McCaw log depot.  He had a decent sized 2 story farm house, cow barn,<br/>
grain silo, and several other outbuildings on the property including a<br/>
wooden pier that jutted out over the mud flats about 30 feet with a<br/>
wooden skiff tied to it. Outside the barn stood a state of the art<br/>
circa 1908 John Deer tractor on top of crushed oyster shells that<br/>
paved the driveways around the barn. There were many other fine pieces<br/>
of farm equipment too.  Nothing on the McPhetridge farm was fairly new<br/>
but all of it was nothing less than the best that money could buy for<br/>
its time.<br/>
<br/>
Davis Jr. showed me into his home and had me sit at his kitchen table.<br/>
He offered me a cup of coffee from a black pot on top of the GE<br/>
Electric range. The coffee was lukewarm, black, and bitter. I choked<br/>
it down while he went to retrieve something from a back room. He<br/>
returned a few minutes later with a small black metal box fitted with<br/>
a small padlock and set it on the table. "My father has been holding<br/>
onto this for over 20 years.  He told me that it was very important<br/>
and that I should never even mention it let alone let anyone see it<br/>
unless I was sure that they were in no way connected to the McCaw<br/>
Company or the Geraldson Corporation."<br/>
<br/>
"How do you know that I am not working for Geraldson now?"<br/>
<br/>
"Why would anyone working for Geraldson be poking around their former<br/>
offices? Anyone who works for them wouldn't need to be hanging around<br/>
there since they tore down the place.  Besides, I am a pretty good<br/>
judge of people, Mr. Stealthboxxer. Your fake business card didn't<br/>
have me fooled for a minute but I can tell from the way you talk that<br/>
you are telling the truth about being a PI and that you had<br/>
information about my father. I can just tell, can't explain it, just a<br/>
gut feeling I get."<br/>
<br/>
"Well Mr. McPhetridge, I appreciate your confidence in me."<br/>
<br/>
"Please, call me Davis."<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, Davis it is then. Please call me SB."<br/>
<br/>
"No problem, SB. Anyway, here is the story about this box. My father<br/>
was the engineer for McCaw's steam engine that brought logs out of the<br/>
Black Hills to the log dump here at Mud Bay for 20 years. He had very<br/>
good relationship with the president of the company, Sam McCaw.<br/>
However, Dad didn't get along with McCaw's Operations Manager,<br/>
Stanford Corbin. Dad always said that Corbin was a snake and a cheat<br/>
and was stealing money from the company but he couldn't prove it.  He<br/>
also said that Corbin was doing something else behind McCaw's back.<br/>
Something that Corbin was going to a lot of trouble to keep secret<br/>
from McCaw and from just about everybody else."<br/>
<br/>
"Did your father ever tell you what that was?"<br/>
<br/>
"No. He said that he should not tell me for my own safety."<br/>
<br/>
"Then your father knew what it was that Corbin was doing."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, he was sure of it. He told me that it was because of him knowing<br/>
what Corbin was doing that he had the accident." <br/>
<br/>
"Accident?"<br/>
<br/>
"Dad was run over by his own train in 1917. He was bringing a load of<br/>
logs down from Bordeaux at the end of the day and noticed a tree<br/>
fallen across the tracks on a stretch of straight track.  He stopped<br/>
the train and got out with his bucksaw to move the deadfall. While he<br/>
was walking down the track toward the tree the brakes on the train<br/>
released and the engine rolled right over him.  He lost his left leg<br/>
below the knee. Dad said that he was sure that Corbin had set it up<br/>
and had tried to kill him. Mr. McCaw was out of the area on a business<br/>
trip when it happened and died while on that trip so he never returned<br/>
to the company. Dad said that he had planned to tell Mr. McCaw about<br/>
his suspicions of Corbin but after McCaw died he decided to leave it<br/>
alone and just try to get on with his own life.  He had bought this<br/>
land a couple years before the accident and had built the house.  He<br/>
bought some milk cows and started a small dairy operation.  I was just<br/>
19 and quit my job at the oyster farm up the bay to help him run the<br/>
farm.  Mom died a few years later and Dad and I ran the farm together<br/>
until he died four years ago."<br/>
<br/>
"What happened with Corbin? Wasn't your father afraid that Corbin<br/>
would try to kill him again after he left the company?"<br/>
<br/>
"Corbin left right after news about McCaw's death. A new president<br/>
took over and not too long after that the McCaw logging company began<br/>
going downhill.  Their operations got smaller and smaller with fewer<br/>
logs being cut and fewer employees working for them until they closed<br/>
up in '27."<br/>
<br/>
"Any idea where Corbin went?"<br/>
<br/>
"Dad had friends in the company that used to visit him from time to<br/>
time.  They kept him up on company news and things. They told him that<br/>
Corbin had transferred to the Geraldson Corporation.  He moved up to<br/>
Alaska where Geraldson had a mining operation going on. That's where<br/>
Mr. McCaw had been when he died. Dad used to say that Corbin was<br/>
Geraldson's hand picked mole in the McCaw Company and was put there to<br/>
do underhanded business behind Mr. McCaw's back."<br/>
<br/>
"The mining connection again."<br/>
<br/>
"Whats that?"<br/>
<br/>
One boot in the mud, might as well jump in with both Buddy always<br/>
said. I had had a hunch about the McCaw operation since I had found<br/>
out about Geraldson's run of luck in the gold mining business. Seemed<br/>
as good a time as any to ask the question. "Davis, did your father<br/>
ever say anything about a gold mining operation going on in the Black<br/>
Hills that the McCaw Company was involved in?"<br/>
<br/>
"Gold! In the Black Hills! Gee, SB, you really do your homework don't<br/>
you. Yes, Dad told me that Geraldson had originally setup the McCaw<br/>
Logging Company for a front to cover a gold mining operation going on<br/>
in the Black Hills. Dad had been sworn to secrecy about it when he<br/>
first hired on with them.  It wasn't a large mine, played out after<br/>
about eight years. Dad said Geraldson's people did a pretty good job<br/>
of keeping it quiet too. By the time that the rumors got out about the<br/>
gold it was already played out and the mines were blasted closed. Dad<br/>
said that Geraldson had some top notch geologists, not prospectors<br/>
mind you but real university schooled science fellows who had found<br/>
the gold in the hills back in '92. They found three areas that held<br/>
gold and quickly setup mines there. Geraldson had secretly shipped in<br/>
mining equipment disguised as newfangled logging equipment. Dad said<br/>
that there was always some new equipment coming into the woods in<br/>
those days so it didn't cause any suspicion. They had three different<br/>
mines that they were operating back during its heyday and even a<br/>
makeshift refinery to process the ore. Dad said they had hollowed out<br/>
some large logs and used them to transport refined ore from the mine<br/>
down to the log dump. They hired some local miners from the coal mine<br/>
in Centralia under the pretense of cutting a railroad tunnel through a<br/>
hill for the logging operation. They paid the miners to not talk about<br/>
the gold mining operation. Dad was paid very well and got a large<br/>
bonus each year to keep quiet and help keep up the front of the<br/>
logging operation. That's how he was able to buy this place. Dad was<br/>
supposed to have a pension from the McCaw Company to take care of him<br/>
for his later years but Corbin made sure that Dad never saw one penny<br/>
of it. So Dad bought this place and all of the farm equipment to go<br/>
with it with the money he had saved during the mining days. He figured<br/>
it would set us up for a fairly comfortable life and it has.  The<br/>
money is about gone but the dairy farm and oyster farming still make<br/>
enough money to keep me fed. I don't have a wife or family so I expect<br/>
that the farm is all I need."<br/>
<br/>
"Sounds like your father was a very practical man. Reminds me of my<br/>
grandfather. Same generation, same ideals. My grandfather once said<br/>
that a man shouldn't ever get himself in a position where he doesn't<br/>
have to work for his living. He always said that an honest day's work<br/>
keeps a man honest and healthy. I can't argue with a man who still<br/>
works 10 hours a day at 82."<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, he sounds a lot like my father too. That's the way he was,<br/>
worked until the day he died right out there in the barn."<br/>
<br/>
"So in all those years since your father retired from the McCaw<br/>
Company no one from Geraldson approached him?"<br/>
<br/>
"Nope. Dad said that the only person who knew that he had dirt on<br/>
Stanford Corbin was Corbin himself. I guess Corbin was just too busy<br/>
with his new position to worry about Dad. Nobody ever came around. <br/>
But Dad knew that someday someone would. That's what he always told<br/>
me. And that's why he kept this box all these years."<br/>
<br/>
"Do you know what's in it?"<br/>
<br/>
"Nope. Dad made a point that I was not to ask him about it and that I<br/>
was not to even look in it myself while he was alive. I trusted my<br/>
father, Mr. Stealthboxxer. Never had a reason to disobey him and still<br/>
don't. If he was right about what he knew I don't even want to know<br/>
what's inside that box. Remember, he told me that it was for my own<br/>
protection that he didn't ever tell me the whole story about it. I<br/>
still believe that Mr. Stealthboxxer, especially after seeing<br/>
Geraldson sell the old McCaw property for one tenth of its market<br/>
value last month. Nobody sells for that cheap Mr. Stealthboxxer unless<br/>
they are trying to wipe their hands of something dirty. I've been<br/>
living here for 32 years right next door to Geraldson's regional<br/>
office for most of that time. I have seen some of their people. They<br/>
scare the willies out of me and I don't mind saying so. They haven't<br/>
paid me or Dad any attention in all these years and I don't want them<br/>
to start. I'm going to give this box to you and be done with it and<br/>
live my life as a dairy farmer, simple and safe thank you very much."<br/>
<br/>
"Davis, I appreciate what you are saying. I don't want for you to get<br/>
messed up in anything either. If what you say is true about Geraldson<br/>
and their being into something dirty I want to protect you as much as<br/>
I can. I promise that I won't mention you or your father or any of his<br/>
connections to this case to anyone that I don't know for certain I can<br/>
trust and that is a very small group of people I can assure you. You<br/>
have my word."<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you, SB. It's really a relief to finally be done with it. Dad<br/>
was always a pretty contented man but I could tell that this stuck in<br/>
the back of his mind always and I am sure that he would be happy to<br/>
know that the secret burden he carried for all those years is finally<br/>
off his shoulders. And mine. I have a key for that lock hidden here in<br/>
the kitchen. Dad always insisted that I know where it was even though<br/>
he told me never to open the box myself. I'll get it for you."  <br/>
<br/>
He waked to the cupboard over the kitchen counter and opened the door.<br/>
 He pulled out a stack of earthen bowls and then pulled a loose<br/>
clapboard off of the back of the cabinet wall exposing a small recess<br/>
in the wall.  Attached to a leather key fob was a single rusty key<br/>
with an odd cut to it. He handed it over and the leather was curled at<br/>
the edges and cracked and dry.  "Here you go, Mr. Stealthboxxer. It's<br/>
all yours now. I hope it helps you in your case, whatever that is."<br/>
<br/>
I gave him my thanks. I also gave him my real business card and<br/>
instructions to call my office if anyone came around asking about me,<br/>
the box, his father, or McCaw or Geraldson just in case. I wanted to<br/>
make sure that he would be protected in case there was more going on<br/>
that either he or I didn't know about.  I took the box and the key and<br/>
left him there in his kitchen in the mid afternoon. It was good to see<br/>
the honest look of relief on the simple farmer's face of a burden of<br/>
many years lifted.<br/>
