&gt; I checked on it a couple of months ago and found it totally <br/>
exposed <br/>

&gt; under the log than how it had been hidden the first time we found <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; way back when (it would've still been easy to retrieve by a <br/>
&gt; letterboxer).  I also noted comments in the Calkins Point LB from <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; few weeks ago that other folks had visited the Heart of Lake WA <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; recently and it was still there.  Not sure if an animal is nudging <br/>
&gt; it out or if the new 'thrashers' in the area are now taking to <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; region for smoke breaks from their hours wasted on the nearby <br/>
&gt; concrete jungle...<br/>
