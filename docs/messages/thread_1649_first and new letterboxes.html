we did it. Last weekend we found a terrific letterbox, Sneaky Sleeper.<br>
It was our first. The children especially enjoyed handfeeding the<br>
chickadees after we found the letterbox. We were not so successful<br>
with the Scent of Fear. Another day.<br>
So today we went out and planted two new boxes. The kids were so<br>
excited.  We plan on adding several more to the same route, one day soon.<br>
Thanks all for sharing your stories, knowledge and expertise.<br>
pilgrimsinthisland (family name) and Chocolate Bunny (my lovely<br>
daughter)...she just had to have her own stamp and name<br>
now as for the wee guy.<br>
He still wants his own, and his name, thus far shall be Spiderman, hmmm,<br>
is there a copywrite on that, or do all nearly 4 year old boys get<br>
free use of that name???<br>
