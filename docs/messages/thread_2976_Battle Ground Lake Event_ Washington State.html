Both have received necessary maintanence and are currently active. The clues can be found on the LbNA website. (www.letterboxing.org) RaqsEnigma and I have previous obligations, so we won't be able to attend the event. But I wanted you to know that the first two boxes in the park are alive and well.<br>
