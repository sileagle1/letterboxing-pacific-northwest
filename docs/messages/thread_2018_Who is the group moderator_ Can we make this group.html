Hi again-<br>
<br>
I like to have everything I read all on the same page. The LBNA group<br>
has an RSS feed. The moderator from this group can allow that to happen.<br>
<br>
Look here to see what I am talking about:<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/rss<br>
<br>
This would be awesome. Anyone agree or disagree?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

The RSS feeds are only available for Yahoo Groups that are viewable by<br>
the public.  This board is currently configured so only members of<br>
this board can read the messages.<br>
<br>
I'm more than happy to open the message boards for everyone to<br>
read--member or not--if there aren't any objections to such a thing. <br>
The main letterboxing talk list is open for anyone to read so it's not<br>
a crazy suggestion, though there is a bit less privacy with that type<br>
of setting.<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>

Thanks,<br>

If no one objects, that would be awesome. <br>
<br>
If people don't want that, then that's okay too. I understand.<br>

I say leave it like it is. I was a moderator for a private yahoo group <br>
that allowed anyone to read the messages and it became a real pain in <br>
the backside. Once I switched back to members being the only ones to <br>
read postings life returned to normal. Besides with the "big LB list" <br>
being public and most people post their boxes there I think that their <br>
is no reason for this list to change. We tend to discuss (sometimes <br>
quite heatedly) more personal things on this list and as such I agree <br>
with dvn2r ckr on that matter.<br>
