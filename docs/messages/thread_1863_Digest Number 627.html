                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are a couple of ways to send a personal e-mail as a reply to a posted <br/>
message.<br/>
<br/>
You can always go into the LbPNW groups web page, find the message, click <br/>
reply and check at the top box where it says "TO" and click the drop down <br/>
arrow to click on the persons e-mail address. It will only go to the address <br/>
in the TO box.<br/>
<br/>
If you getting your messages in Daily Digest, Just click on the persons <br/>
e-mail address after their name in the "FROM" at the top of their message.<br/>
<br/>
If you get individual messages, click "REPLY ALL" at the top of your Windows <br/>
screen and remove the group name so you only leave the address for the <br/>
person you are responding to.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

&gt; Subject: Question for yahoo Owner or Moderator<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do I email someone offlist? I tried clicking on an email adress<br/>
&gt; but it came up as a regular posting. I would like to submit my adress<br/>
&gt; for the Spring postal letterbox but dont want to display my adress to<br/>
&gt; the entire group (no offense guys). I also tried going to<br/>
&gt; the "members" page and looking up the members yahoo ID but that didnt<br/>
&gt; work either. Thanks.<br/>
