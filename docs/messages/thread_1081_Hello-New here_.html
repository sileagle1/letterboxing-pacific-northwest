I'm Melissa, a new LBer from Bremerton, WA.  I discovered <br>
letterboxing several months ago via an article in a family magazine, <br>
and have been hooked ever since.  After reading, I got all my gear, <br>
picked my first location, and have yet to go on a hunt. Time and life <br>
events have just not allowed me too. Things have slowed down a little <br>
(for now), and I'm ready to begin.  I noticed that there are at least <br>
2 new ones near by, so I think I'll start there. I have 2 little <br>
boys, and they are just as excited as I am to begin. <br>
Anyway...that's it from me.  Just wanted to say hi, and introduce <br>
myself. Can't wait to get started!<br>
