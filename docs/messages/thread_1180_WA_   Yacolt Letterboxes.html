<br/>
We were heading up to Lake Merwin today and knew we were going into<br/>
Yacolt to have breakfast at Grammy's.  No better time than the present<br/>
to pick up Campfire Lady's letterboxes out that way!  <br/>
<br/>
Chelatchie Prairie, Moulton Falls and Lucia Falls Letterboxes are all in<br/>
wonderful spots and the stamps totally coincide with the place.  <br/>
<br/>
We were unable to get Luv Ya because there were people picnicking at the<br/>
falls picnic table where compass bearings must be got and we were<br/>
doubtful that we could be discreet, so we will be saving that for<br/>
another time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Campfire Lady for placing these terrific letterboxes in<br/>
Southwest Washington.  We really enjoyed the beautiful scenery and the<br/>
artwork!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

and were very very sad.  We did manage to find the Moulton Falls before the<br/>
skys opened up.. ok WHLE the skies opened up.. we were stamping in in the<br/>
middle of a huge rainstorm.. trying to keep everything dry.. so didn't pick<br/>
up the Chelatchie Prairie box.<br/>

&gt; We were unable to get Luv Ya because there were people picnicking <br/>
at the<br/>
&gt; falls picnic table where compass bearings must be got and we were<br/>

<br/>
Don't worry about being discreet for this box because it isn't there. <br/>
It seems it had washed away in the snow melt and I have just made the <br/>
note to the Letterboxing North American site that it is missing. I <br/>
will have it replaced as soon as I get some free time and I will post <br/>
to this site when it is available. It seems Camp Fire activities are <br/>
ruling my life now. I am sorry if anyone had looked for it and <br/>
couldn't find it. It is my first MIA.<br/>
Thank you for the compliments on my stamps and boxes.<br/>
