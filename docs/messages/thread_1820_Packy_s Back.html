Thanks, Maiden, for the heads up on this box. As of this afternoon, it's back amongst <br/>
the living. I knew when I first hid this box last year that it would have a limited <br/>
lifespan (unlike the amazing Winking Eagle) This is the third incarnation of Packy's <br/>
Place. My fingers are crossed that this one will be there for the next visitor. <br/>
<br/>
As for the long-lived Eagle by Windairen, I gave it a quick check before I left the Zoo <br/>
this afternoon. There it was, sitting out in the light of day, for all to see. I place it, <br/>
once again, beneath the meager remains of 'grounded timber.' This box has been <br/>
moved and rehidden again and again by kindly groundskeepers and has greeted <br/>
many visitors in its three years at the Zoo. On my next visit, I think I'll have to stash a <br/>
log in my tote bag as first aid for this old timer. How do you smuggle in a log <br/>
discreetly? Funhog<br/>

<br/>
Borrow a kid and stroller. You could smuggle in an old growth tree <br/>
with our mondo stroller.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the zoo, the Lorikeet box is still going strong and has <br/>
a new log too. This box has probably had more traffic than the rest <br/>
of my boxes combined.<br/>
