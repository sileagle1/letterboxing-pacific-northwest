Hi Ya'll -<br/>
My goal is to check on and replant, if necessary, my<br/>
Beacon Rock box called the PASSION.  However, a little<br/>
birdie told me about a trail head that is located<br/>
ACROSS the street from the Beacon Rock trail head.<br/>
<br/>
Does ANYONE know what that trail head is called????  I<br/>
don't recall seeing it and the birdie couldn't<br/>
remember - just that they hiked it a few years ago.<br/>
<br/>

If everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could be found by those who seem to only experience the bad in life - then the world be a happier place!<br/>
OR people could just meet JESUS and have it all!<br/>

I'm going off of about a 2 year old memory here. Isn't there a <br/>
campground on the other side of Hwy 14?  There might be some trails <br/>
branching off from the campground?<br/>

&gt; Hamilton Mountain trailhead is across SR14 from Beacon Rock.  <br/>
Hardy Falls is along the way on that trail, too.  Both are <br/>
now "state parks", and require a park pass for $5.00.  You can <br/>
purchase the pass at Beacon Rock and then use the same one to do <br/>
Hamilton Mtn the same day (or vice versa).  <br/>
