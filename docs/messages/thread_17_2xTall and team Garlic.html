where it was being very familiar with the primary venue. I feel this <br/>
box is a Must Do for anyone visiting Seattle.  The primary venue is a <br/>
classic place to visit and right now some neat things to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing more!<br/>

<br/>
We have enjoyed finding other people's letterboxes so much, we wanted to <br/>
do one of our own.<br/>
And, of course, now that we've done one, we are already trying to think <br/>
of places to hide another!<br/>
<br/>
And thank you for returning King Salmon - we'll be up there as soon as <br/>
work and T-ball allow to fill in the blank space in our book.<br/>
(such a clever poem, too!)<br/>
