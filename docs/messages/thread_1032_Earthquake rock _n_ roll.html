Sorry it took so long to reply--I was driving down there from Seattle <br>
and only arrived today!  =)<br>
<br>
The earthquake, naturally, was quite exciting.  My grandmother and <br>
aunt in Paso Robles got an even better ride out of the deal, although <br>
from what I heard it made a class A mess of their place knocking <br>
darned near everything to the floor.  But they're okay and their <br>
homes are okay.  We traditionally head to Paso Robles each Christmas <br>
to celebrate at my grandmother's house, and I'm hoping for a couple <br>
of good aftershocks while I'm there.  Later we plan to go into <br>
downtown and check out the damage firsthand.  I drove passed it on my <br>
way down to San Luis today, but never got out of the car to check it <br>
out close up.  Parking is tough!  It seems like everyone in the <br>
county was out there taking pictures.  *shaking head*  Sick, twisted, <br>
people that they are.  =)<br>
