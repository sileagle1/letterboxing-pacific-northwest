                    <div class="plaintext-content">Team Garlic spent a sunny Sunday afternoon at Pt. Defiance Park in <br>
Tacoma and found Pt. Pagoda (the Japanese garden was beautiful), <br>
Humbuggy, Sea Otter, and Frontier. We ran out of time and will have to <br>
go back another day to search for Polar Bear and Fantasy.<br>
<br>
On one of the less-travelled trails we encountered a family with the <br>
telltale yellow Garmin -<br>
  "Geocaching?" we asked.<br>
"Yes, are you?"<br>
  "No, we're letterboxing"<br>
"They're letterboxers!" the mom I was talking to told rest of her crew, <br>
so we could all relax in the knowledge that our respective rummagings <br>
around in the bushes would go unremarked.<br>
