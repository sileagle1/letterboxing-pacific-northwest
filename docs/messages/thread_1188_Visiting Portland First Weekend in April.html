<br/>
Lucky me has been visiting the wet NW this Spring and I have another <br/>
trip planned with the extremely cool teen letterboxer, Kerblammo, the <br/>
first weekend in April.<br/>
<br/>
We have a WHOLE day on Sunday April 4 to go letterboxing together.  <br/>
We will be staying downtown and hoofing or light railing it.  Ryan <br/>
has graciously given me a couple suggestions on where we can go for <br/>
some primo boxing (I have just dated myself), but we'd sure love to <br/>
meet any of you who are free for coffee (y'all drink that stuff up <br/>
there, right?) and/or a stamp exchange.  I promise we're not weird <br/>
Las Vegans, well, at least not in the traditional sense.  Don't be <br/>
scared!<br/>
<br/>
Hope we can hook up,<br/>
