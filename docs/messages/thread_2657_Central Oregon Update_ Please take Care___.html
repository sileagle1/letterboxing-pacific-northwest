<br>
Went out and checked on several of our boxes yesterday, in preparation for winter and <br>
found several boxes exposed and some not even closed properly. Just a reminder <br>
especially for you newbies, ( the rest of you have heard it before), please treat others <br>
boxes with respect and replace the box better than you found it. If you don't the boxes <br>
will disappear and our little hobby will also. Remember to hide them so they can NOT be <br>
seen by passer-by's. I checked 4 boxes yeserday and 3 of them could be seen by just <br>
walking by. Just my 2 cents worth.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
John of the 4Dtoes<br>
