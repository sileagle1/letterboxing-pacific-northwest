<br>
but first, before the revelation---<br>
<br>
<br>
Funhog was the only letterboxer from afar who guessed the indentity <br>
correctly...<br>
<br>
<br>
but I didn't dare let on....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
not even to Wes...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
or any of the other inquisitive letterboxing types out there...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
the Mystery Guests were:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Pete & Wanda <br>
<br>
hailing from Rhode Island!!!!!<br>
(of 5,000+ found letterboxes & <br>
the Hitchhiker Letterbox Status Website fame)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A fun afternoon/evening was enjoyed by many folks.  Not sure on the <br>
final count but from what I can remember the following folks joined <br>
us to welcome Pete & Wanda with true Pacific Northwest Style (I <br>
apologize totally if I've omitted anybody--I don't have signature <br>
stamps in my logbook from everybody who attended and I'm going off <br>
of both my logbook & my awful memory at the moment):<br>
<br>
The Howard Family (4) who debuted their new signature stamp at the <br>
event<br>
Jessi with her friend & her puppy Kayo<br>
Keegan the Airedale Terrier & Scout the Barn Cat<br>
Pirate Dad<br>
Pirate Mom<br>
Alicia<br>
Spiderman<br>
Blaze<br>
Shawn<br>
Brandy<br>
Mischief<br>
Twilight<br>
Sunshine<br>
Charlie Trail Duster<br>
Fudrick<br>
Campfire Lady<br>
Cat's Meow<br>
Pandora<br>
IronBear<br>
MiniBullyMom<br>
RayvenDad<br>
RayvenMom<br>
RayvenJr<br>
RayvenDaughter (I'm sorry I can't remember her trail name)<br>
Ravensburger<br>
Celt<br>
Marcus<br>
Ducky<br>
Ole Vet incognito as Quilting Noni's signature stamp<br>
Armyswmr 99<br>
dvn2r ckr, rnrB & trkr<br>
<br>
<br>
I know I'm omitting an entire family but, unfortunately, I never got <br>
their signature stamps.  I think the final count was mid-low 40s.<br>
<br>
Meeting all the area letterboxers from near & far was awesome!  It's <br>
so cool to finally get to put faces with signature stamps and email <br>
exchanges.  The food was great and the weather held up perfectly.  <br>
Just threatening enough to discourage all the locals away from the <br>
park but dry enough to be able to enjoy fellowship, stamp exchanges <br>
and to seek out a few boxes in the area.  Also, one of the traveling <br>
letterboxes that Team Rayvenhaus brought was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!  <br>
Not sure if they want me to reveal the details of the box on the <br>
board but, hands down, this letterbox was one of the best I've ever <br>
seen!  The message, concept, stamp, container, craftsmanship, <br>
artistic effort--you name it, was simply impressive and the final <br>
product was stunning! Definitely above & beyond the call of duty!!! <br>
A great tribute to some true heroes in our lives!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks, folks, for joining us to heartily welcome Pete & Wanda to <br>
the region.  We look forward to seeing you at future gatherings and <br>
for getting an opportunity to possibly look for a letterbox or two <br>
you might place in the future!<br>

<br>
I don't know where to start. Piper (the artist formerly known as Scout the<br>
Barncat) and I had one super-duper-blowout good time at the Mystery Meet in<br>
Des Moines, Washington yesterday.<br>
<br>
Three cheers for dvn2r ckr, for organizing the Mystery Meet. She also<br>
planted great letterboxes, carved an awesome event stamp and coordinated<br>
the arrival of Wanda and Pete, our mystery guests from the great state of<br>
Rhode Island. dvn2r ckr has more energy than any three of us put together,<br>
I'll wager.<br>
<br>
Since this was our first gathering, we had no idea what to expect. Folks<br>
just started coming up and the stamp swapping frenzy began. It was so nice<br>
to place a face with some of the familiar stamps we've seen in the journals<br>
in the Northwest. I chatted with the Pirate family and we were soon<br>
comparing our journals. I had hit several letterboxes right after them. It<br>
felt as though I've been following them around for weeks!<br>
<br>
I second dvn2r ckr's words describing Rayvenhous' event stamp. Every aspect<br>
of it and its box were very special for the occasion. Well done<br>
Rayvenfamily, well done.<br>
<br>
And meeting Rhode Island's two famous letterboxers was so much fun. Wanda<br>
and Pete are the tops. Piper and I were lucky enough to go letterboxing<br>
with them for dvn2r ckr's two boxes planted for the Mystery Meet. It made<br>
our day.<br>
<br>
So all in all, a most rewarding day. Thanks to all we met. You made us feel<br>
a part of this fine letterboxing community.<br>
<br>
See you on the trails.<br>

We were actualy only about 3 miles away from the park at the height <br>

got one in the works.  Just don't have a schedule yet--it's supposed <br>
to happen sometime in the Fall and another letterboxer or two or <br>
three 'you would be delighted' to get to meet.<br>
<br>
Yes, Wanda did mention the Dancing at Bougival HH so I know she's <br>
interested in looking for the 'original' Nail box!  Sounded like <br>
they were headed down South toward the end of this week.<br>
<br>
Have a great Memorial Day Weekend!<br>
