Blanco--the box that nobody could find except for one person who did <br>
so by accident--I've updated with CORRECT clues.  =)  The box is <br>
still there in its same old hiding place, though.<br>
<br>
I've also made a slight update for the box I planted at Yaquina <br>
Lighthouses.  The short little trees that were in the area when I <br>
planted the box, I'm happy to report, are growing strong and are now <br>
MUCH larger--making the box a bit more of a challenge to get.  =)  Be <br>
it known, however, that it's the fault of the trees, not me, when it <br>
comes to the difficulty in finding this box!<br>
