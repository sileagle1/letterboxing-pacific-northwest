                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I planted a number of the boxes there in Bellingham, I do have them written in my personal log book (I'm a nerd like that...).  I am going to the gathering in Tacoma here in a bit, but after that I can type them, if nobody has them typed out already.  The boxes I have planted in Bellingham include:<br>
   <br>
  WWU Series (2) (1-2 hours)<br>
  Faery Tryst Series (3) (2-3 hours)<br>
  Boulevard Park (1) (1 hour or less)<br>
  Whatcom Falls (1) (1 hour, or more if you want to hang out, since it's a neat park)<br>
   <br>
  There's been some discrepancies regarding the first WWU box, and possibly the log book missing from the Whatcom Falls box, but I haven't been up to check.  If you look for the Faery ones (which I think is kind of a neat series, but some uphill and possibly muddy hiking) could you please take with you some plastic bags?  I had a complete logic lapse when I took those with me and forgot that they were not in plastic bags!  I hope they are okay, but have not heard about them in months.<br>
   <br>
  Let me know which, if any, you would like to find and will need clues.<br>
   <br>
  I may also be able to find clues for the five Larrabee Park boxes, but many of those will take a few hours, there's pay parking, etc.  Other than that, there's the Padden Puppy Trove, where the Faery Tryst series starts from, and a Raptor box or something I've never had the chance to go find.<br>
   <br>
  I think that's all of them.<br>
