park with George" LB series. <br/>
#1 We found after much searching. Looks as if it has been lost <br/>
before and replanted by LB hunters. Seems to be in a precarious spot <br/>
where kids could easily find it. <br/>
#2 Found hidden in the ivy. Alive and well.<br/>
#3 First found a geocache nearby. Then with diligent hunting found <br/>
the LB alive and well. <br/>
Thanks Jess for the nice side trip.<br/>
