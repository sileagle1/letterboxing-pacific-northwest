ColumbiaRiver.  A good leg stretch hike.  I believe Mischief pulled <br>
her Snoqualmie Falls series until thespring run off ( soon??? but she <br>
is busy)<br>
<br>
I thiink there is a mystery box not far from Ginko ( as the freeway <br>
flies)<br>
<br>
Eastern washington needs some pumping up. :-(<br>
<br>
Sorry about all the walking wounded.  However it is great to hear the <br>
Lee clan will be around longer to populate the state with plaxtic <br>
galore.<br>
<br>
Too many boxes, so little time.<br>
