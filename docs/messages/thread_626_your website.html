Yes of course, there's a weblinks section of the board that allows for one<br/>
to put in URLS (Addresses) to other websites.  That is to be used for those<br/>
that do not want their boxes listed on the site.  Let me make one thing<br/>
perfectly clear... I'm doing this more for myself than anything at all. I'm<br/>
not trying to create a DB that is like the Yahoo site, nor am I trying to<br/>
take over the stuff that the main LbNA site does, I'm just trying to offer,<br/>
to those that want it, a place where they can keep a journal, where they can<br/>
keep track of the boxes that they have already found, where they can chat<br/>
about the things we like doing best.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; I have tried accessing your website, but I have to wait for my Sys<br/>
&gt; Admin. (DH) to enable cookies. In the meanwhile, in follow up to my<br/>
&gt; question posed to the PNW group.....Because not everybody chooses<br/>
&gt; to, or is allowed to post to the national site, are you going to<br/>
&gt; have links to other clue sites on your site?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rose<br/>
