                    <div class="plaintext-content">around me, at a little bitty park in Portland, with my good old Army <br>
buddy Kris and her grouchy Korean dog. Under the guise of visiting <br>
Kris, I've come to Portland to letterbox. Kris reluctantly comes with <br>
me to Lacamas Creek Park, where she swears everyone there is a <br>
letterboxer. I assure her that in my long months (since April 2003!) <br>
I've never met anyother letterboxer while letterboxing, and all these <br>
people will look at her like she's insane if she asks them what they <br>
are doing. Now we are out at a park I'm sure houses the "Lost <br>
Letterbox", despite not having a proper street map, as the clues <br>
recommend. <br>
<br>
So anyway, I'm looking under a tree, on hands and knees, my logbook <br>
and baggie o stamps next to me, when Kris insists that a couple who <br>
just entered the (formerly deserted) park are letterboxers. I assure <br>
her they are not. Then a veritable horde of people come towards me, <br>
and I scramble to come up with a logical reason to be rooting under <br>
trees, when I notice that the couple is none other than Pandora and <br>
Iron Bear! And the "horde" is Camp Fire Lady and Willow with <br>
attendant children! Kris got a great introduction to lb'ing, gathered <br>
all sorts of stamps, and I got an event stamp for this little <br>
serendipitous meeting in the Portland wilds! Good thing too, as under <br>
the trees was completely the WRONG place to be looking!!<br>
<br>
So I just had to come out of self imposed lurkdom to share-this hobby <br>
is the best!<br>
