  Now you can take advantage of 2 more new letterboxes in Yacolt, WA. <br>
for a total of 4. Moulton Falls letterbox and Chelatchie Prairie <br>
Railroad Letterbox. These boxes boast some of the prettiest scenery <br>
in the area with waterfalls and rivers, clean trails and a historical <br>
open train ride to Moulton Falls. Check out <br>
www.chelatchieprairierr.org for fares and schedules for the train. <br>
The clues for these boxes are easy with relatively flat trails that <br>
include restrooms and picnic areas. Pack a lunch to take on the train <br>
and make a day of it with the kids. The train also offers Theme Rides <br>
such as a reenacted train robbery, Headless Horseman ride, Rides to <br>
the tree farm for you're Christmas tree and volunteer historians to <br>
tell you all about the railroad. At the moment the Chelatchie Prairie <br>
Railroad Letterbox is in a temporary location due to the Swing Bridge <br>
being closed off but will be moved in the Spring so it can be <br>
accessed from the train. There are even a few surprises <br>
for "Firsties"!<br>
Happy Hunting and don't forget to stop by Lewisville Park on the way <br>
to find my Happy Postman Series and Soggy2pair's Lewisville Scramble.<br>
