Lot's of folks plant boxes where the won't visit often. They usually <br>
not in the clues that it is an "orphan." Local boxers will often <br>
help maintain such boxes. It's probably a good idea to try to make <br>
orphans as weatherproof as possible.<br>

Basically, I use all of the techniques that you mentioned. I will <br>
drive by a park and think that it needs a letterbox, or I will see a <br>
park on the map that doesn't have a letterbox in it and decide that I <br>
will carve and plant one there. Sometimes, I have an idea for a stamp <br>
and then I try to find a park to hide it in. Ryan's African Safari <br>
series is a good example of that. He carved the stamps first. African <br>
animals...and then decided to hide them all over the Columbia River <br>
Gorge. Sometimes you hear the name of a park or a trail that just <br>
begs for a stamp. The Shy Bear trail at Cougar Mountain was one of <br>
those. I just had to carve a "shy bear" and hide it on that trail. <br>

--sometimes, --This way you can put the name of the park or trail on <br>
your stamp (if it's NOT a mystery)-- or if you are hiding the box by <br>
a weird looking tree, your stamp could be of that weird-looking tree. <br>
<br>

> location when it is done? <br>
<br>
--sometimes, like if you want to do a series of stamps about Fly-<br>
Fishing and you think you might hide it in a park where people fly-<br>
fish. So you carve your stamps and then you go out and try to find <br>
places to hide them. Sometimes you find that the first park you <br>
thought of won't work and you have to hide the boxes somewhere else. <br>
<br>
 How do you find your parks? Off a list <br>
> somewhere like THPRD? From previous visits?<br>
<br>
Yes and Yes. I look at maps, I do internet searches, I drive around! <br>
Say that I want to hide a stamp of a beaver in a park that has beaver <br>
dams in it. I do an internet search of local parks and beaver dams. <br>
Bingo.  Maybe I was in a local park hunting for a letterbox and I <br>
found a great spot to hide another letterbox. I'll go home and carve <br>
a stamp to hide at that park too. <br>
<br>
 How far do you plant and <br>
> travel to maintain them?     <br>
> <br>
Well, I plant extremely far away and I don't really maintain them.<br>
Since I am a flight attendant, there is a chance that I will get back <br>
to maintain a box on the East Coast. But sometimes I have trouble <br>
maintaining boxes right here in my own back yard. I have boxes up in <br>
Bellingham, but if they go missing, it might be a year before I get <br>
back up there to fix that.  Sometimes you just have to retire the <br>
box. I had a box in Montreal, Canada that went missing. I just <br>
retired it from the LBNA list because I will not be back to replace <br>
it and there is no one nearby who can do it for me.<br>
<br>

<br>
This works sometimes. I have had folks replace boxes for me. For <br>
example, Candlelight replaced one of my Fort Worden boxes before the <br>
park pulled them all. I will not be getting back to Fort Worden <br>
anytime soon, so those boxes will be retired for quite awhile. (we <br>
have tried to get the park there to release the boxes to Candlelight, <br>
but they want to see me in person)<br>
<br>
<br>
 Could you place a far away box and make a note on the clues <br>
> that it won't be maintained and it's "finders luck"? <br>
This is done all the time! Your boxes are art that you give away -- <br>
you don't really "own" them once you release them into the wild. They <br>
might go missing, they might be vandalized. But if they bring a few <br>
folks some happiness, then they have done their job. Sometimes you <br>
just have to let them go.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">How do I decide where to plant?   Well...You can do it either way, carve<br>
the stamp for a certain place and hope there is somewhere to place it.<br>
Or scout it out first, find the perfect spot, come home and carve it and<br>
then go back and place it.<br>
<br>
An example of the first, where I carved a stamp and then went and hoped<br>
there was a spot for it was Colliding Rivers in Douglas County, OR.  The<br>
stamp I carved, I think, is creative and beautiful. Imagine my dismay<br>
when I went to the area I wanted to plant it and found no safe or decent<br>
haven for my baby!  Eventually, I, and a bunch of my cool cousins, went<br>
across the road and found a spot for it.  As far as I know it remains<br>
there to this day, which surprises me since it seemed like the area was<br>
prime real estate for underage drinking and mayhem.  The other stamp in<br>
the area, Wolf Creek Falls, that I thought I placed in a very nice<br>
hiding place, went missing almost from the get-go, I believe.  No one,<br>
even the most diligent of letterboxers, has found this box and I think<br>
there was some landslide activity that may have buried it.  I have not<br>
been back to Glide to check on it since I placed it.  But I always like<br>
to make my clues easy so people can find my boxes, so it must be gone.  <br>
<br>
A recent example of my scoping out a park and a great hiding spot before<br>
carving the stamp was Canby Ferry at Molalla River State Park in Canby.<br>
I found a wonderful little hidey hole and it remains there as we speak. <br>
<br>
Scouting things out and then placing is probably more realistic, but<br>
sometimes another area letterboxer may have had the same idea and what<br>
you thought was your spot is already occupied with a letterbox that has<br>
yet to be posted!!!  That happened to me when I went to place boxes for<br>
our summer event at Upper Macleay Park in Portland last August.  There<br>
was a perfect letterboxing hideaway and Thom Cheney had a wonderful<br>
stamp already waiting there.  Just goes to show...GREAT MINDS THINK<br>
ALIKE.  HA! HA!  <br>
<br>
As for replacing missing stamps, I think it's an excellent idea,<br>
especially if you can get a copy of the original and just re-carve it.<br>
Ryan has done this for Pony Tail and I'd like to do it for Jackon Bottom<br>
Wetlands, but I never did get the original one in the first place<br>
(anyone out there have a copy of it and want to send it along to me?) <br>
<br>
There's my two cents worth.  The advice is as good as you paid for, but<br>
I do actually have a little experience at this sort of thing, so I'd say<br>
it's pretty good.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I usually just hide a letterbox because I'm hiking around somewhere and there aren't any to look for.  That's my USUAL mode of operation, though.<br>
<br>
In other cases, I've found the spot first and carved a stamp especially for it.  (Usually while on the trail at the hiding spot--but not always.)<br>
<br>
Sometimes I carve stamps without a clue as to where they'll go, but I'll pick out whatever is most appropriate for a given location from my stamp collection.<br>
<br>
If you hide enough boxes, you'll eventually do all the possibilities.<br>
<br>
The Temple of Terror box I was inspired to hide after I visited the location once, and later carved a stamp and went back to hide it.<br>
<br>
The African Safari Series I started carving while in Africa, and decided to hide them throughout the Columbia River Gorge.<br>
<br>
The Around the World in 80 Days box was inspired by the stamp I carved.  I saw the picture and wanted to carve it, and the clue was inspired by the stamp.<br>
<br>
All of the lighthouse boxes I carved <br>
before I went knowing I'd be driving down Highway 101 and figured I'd visit the places along the way.<br>
<br>
The Land of Long Ago was inspired while driving down Highway 101 and I HAD to hide a box when I found the place.  I carved that stamp on the trail at the bridge I mention in the clue since I hadn't planned on hiding one earlier.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the generic stamp I carved becomes inspiration for a rather elaborate clue such as Chipmunk of Terror.<br>
<br>
It takes all types!<br>
