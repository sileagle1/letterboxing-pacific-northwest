Hi Folks,<br>
<br>
I'm running a Letterboxing Haiku Contest on the LBMA group and I need some judges.  <br>
<br>
I had originally planned for some Noxers to judge the haiku, but the ones I have chosen <br>
don't appreciate the subtle beauties of walking in the woods looking for Tupperware.  So I <br>
need some disinterested parties to pick our winners.  <br>
<br>
After looking all over the other regional groups on Yahoo, only LbPNW seems to have <br>
members with the joie de vivre of the LBMA group.  So with your group owner's <br>
permission, I'd like to invite members of LbPNW to participate as judges in the contest.<br>
<br>
Deadline for entries is Thanksgiving.  So, if you are interested in judging the contest, you <br>
can view the entries at:<br>
<br>
http://www.members.aol.com/nattybumppolbna/haiku.html<br>
<br>
Please select your favorite 3 and send your vote in an email by Sunday, December 5th to:<br>
<br>
nattybumppolbna@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Only 1 vote per person, please.<br>
<br>
Each haiku (or poem or limerick in some cases) has a Roman numeral.  Please use that to <br>
indicate your selections.  All poetry posted on the web site is eligible  despite the <br>
humorous (?) "Judges comments."<br>
<br>
Your help would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
<br>
