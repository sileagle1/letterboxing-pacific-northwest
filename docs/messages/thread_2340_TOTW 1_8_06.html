You crack me up. No darling, we're not having YOUR signature stamp as our<br>
patch.. although, I like the premise..if only someone didn't have it as<br>
their signature stamp.. How about a western red cedar with a fir tree in the<br>
background, with a waterfall flowing between them and a slug sitting on a<br>
log with a BEAVER in the foreground!<br>

 I like all the ideas so far, but one thing it HAS to include is <br>
BLACKBERRY vines.  Ack.  Ouch.  Uff-da.<br>
<br>
Many, many times I have come away from stamping in with my hair pulled <br>
from the pony holder from the sticker bushes.  Hubby calls it my "John <br>
the Babtist" look.  I call it "Victorious!"  It is a good way to keep <br>
mugglers at bay though...they try not to look at the crazy big woman <br>
with wild hair and a backpack and inky fingers.  It's not polite to <br>
stare.  (hehe)<br>
