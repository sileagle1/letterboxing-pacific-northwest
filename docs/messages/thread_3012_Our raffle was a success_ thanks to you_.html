Folks, you all came through in bigger ways than we could have ever imagined.<br>
<br>
The raffles, with your help, raised just over $2,000!!!!<br>
<br>
All the proceeds will go directly towards our outstanding medical bills. <br>
<br>
The winners have all been contacted and should start receiving their prizes in the next couple of days. <br>

I have not received Seattle Bounds package from Alaska. She's contributing a near complete set of her LTC's and a few stamps. Once I get the package, we will draw out more names. <br>

I can't say it enough; thank you. Thank you. THANK YOU!! <br>
