I am a Coastal Cutthroat Trout of Puget Sound. I was born in this creek. As<br/>
I grew, I swam downstream in search of saltwater.  I made the transition<br/>
from fresh to saltwater in the creek's estuary. I ventured out into the<br/>
Sound, but never strayed more than a few miles from the mouth of my<br/>
birthing creek. I have returned from all odds to spawn in the creek,<br/>
continue the line of my kind and return to live in the estuary. Now after a<br/>
long life, I've come to my final resting spot near the banks of my beloved<br/>
birthing creek. With determined dedication, you can find me.<br/>
<br/>
Start your search for a small park overlooking the Sound where my creek<br/>
joins it. It has a bench or two, an overlook into the creek and small works<br/>
of art. Called Stream Echo, it was created by Tom Jay. A rock obelisk has<br/>
these words inscribed upon it:<br/>
<br/>
Fresh water<br/>
A safe campsite.<br/>
What was once true<br/>
of this special place<br/>
Could be true again,<br/>
Now that you are here.<br/>
<br/>
A rock nearby tells:<br/>
<br/>
Spawn, roe, milt, redd, eyed alevin, sac-fry, parr, smolt, juvenile, adult,<br/>
spawner, kipper, kelt.<br/>
<br/>
While standing by the obelisk, face upstream. Head 340 degrees (all<br/>
readings are magnetic) for 20 paces. Now head 60 degrees and keep the<br/>
hidden creek to your right. A "Caution - Children Playing" yellow sign will<br/>
appear to your left.<br/>
<br/>
You will soon come to an urban island. Cross it and stay the course. Your<br/>
path bends to the right and back to the left while increasing in elevation.<br/>
If you are unsure of yourself, ask the Director. He knows the way.<br/>
<br/>
Soon you will come to a 4-way intersection. Look for a church steeple. Walk<br/>
towards it and use the mid-block crosswalk to reach a small stairway with a<br/>
red metal railing on each side. Walk up the steps. Take a left through the<br/>
parking lot to another parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Head 70 degrees and follow a gravel alley, which will turn into a trail.<br/>
Pass between two concrete barriers. You can hear my creek on your right.<br/>
When you reach a triangle, continue straight.<br/>
<br/>
A five-headed maple stands alone on the right of the trail. A sharp eye<br/>
will soon spot a dead snag riddled by woodpeckers off to the right.<br/>
<br/>
Soon a choice of two bridges must be made. Pick the one the crosses the<br/>
main creek. Continue to a Y. Bear right and cross a long wooden walkway.<br/>
You will pass through salmon berry bushes. Stay on the main trail and cross<br/>
a small wooden bridge over moving water.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail downstream. Go up 32 steps. Walk along and take in the<br/>
views of the creek bed down and to the right. At a graveled T continue<br/>
straight. Pass through a cedar and fir snag gate.<br/>
<br/>
At the Y, go right and down 12 steps, then down 10 more. A short walk will<br/>
reveal 2 small parallel logs. Walk through them and look for an old<br/>
staircase. Climb the 8 steps.<br/>
<br/>
Soon you will come to a T, where a left is needed. You will see a stack of<br/>
logs that are to be used in future work on the streambed to help my kin<br/>
live and spawn. Cross the logs and look down upon my creek. Look between a<br/>
3-headed maple and a single maple. The single maple has a gnarled root with<br/>
a hole in it. There you will find me. Be careful when removing me. Trails<br/>
look down upon this area.<br/>
<br/>
Find your way back to the 2 small parallel logs. Go right and exit the<br/>
woods. As you enter the parking lot, a soothing Glen Garden is to your<br/>
right. Head straight to return to your starting point.<br/>
<br/>
This is my fifth planted letterbox. Please email me with any questions or<br/>
