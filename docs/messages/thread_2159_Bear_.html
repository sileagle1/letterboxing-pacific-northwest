small black bear.  Got about 5 feet from it, before I realized it was <br/>
there.  It didn't see me so I backed away quietly, pulled out my <br/>
hiking poles and assumed a defensive position with them, in case it <br/>
decided to come my way.  Watched it scamper across the trail once I <br/>
was a few hundred feet away.  My heart was absolutely pounding for a <br/>

You chased a bear??!!  That's amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Afraid not, no pictures.  The bear was small enough I was concerned a <br/>
mad momma might be around so I was more interested in putting some <br/>
distance between me and it-them.  Your experience watching one drink <br/>
water sounds wonderful, though.<br/>

Actually, in hindsite, it was a pretty stupid thing to do, but<br/>
fortunately bad came out of it. I still go out and look for bears<br/>
occasionally (it's not all that hard to find them if you know where to<br/>
look!), but I refrain from chasing them nowdays. =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We came across 2 bears at Paradise lodge last summer, what an <br/>
experience! And as you said you didnt see it until it was 5 feet away <br/>
from you, same for me. It was clinging to a tree about at my heighth <br/>
and when I was standing directly next to it, it jumped down off the <br/>
tree, it was so close I could've hugged it, but I chose not too, and <br/>
it ran down a hill, about 50 feet later we came across another and it <br/>
just ran up a hill. Luckily they were just blackbears, they are small <br/>
and pretty shy, if it were a grizzly though, no more Erfellie and <br/>
Sandi, we would be goners!<br/>
<br/>
I had an amazing encounter yesterday, I was out hiking Limpy creek <br/>
botanical trail, and being the photographer I am, I was of course <br/>
taking pictures (camera in hand) and my faithful golden retriever <br/>
loves to run ahead of me, but he will back track, look at me to make <br/>
sure i am still following behind him, then run up the trail again, <br/>
and so the cycle continues. Well I stopped to photograph and tiny <br/>
creek waterfall and stopped just for a few minutes but my mutt was <br/>
gone and I thought it was strange that he hadnt backtracked to look <br/>
for me yet, so I called him and he didnt come running, so I got back <br/>
on the trail and around the bend I saw him there standing in the <br/>
middle of the trail, at first glance I thought "oh no, he found a <br/>
dead animal" becuz he loves rollin in the dead stuff *EEEWWW* but <br/>
then I noticed it wasnt dead. My dog was about 30 feet away from me, <br/>
facing me, and on the ground with its back to me was an enormous <br/>
falcon. My dog was staring at it, giving it his cock-eyed, floppy <br/>
eared, head tilted stare, which he does when he is curious. Anyways I <br/>
slooooowwly approached the 2, and I had to go waaay around the side <br/>
of the trail since the falcons wingspan spread across the entire <br/>
trail and came around the front and there he was, what a beautiful <br/>
bird! just then, I remembered I had my camera in my hand, so of <br/>
course I started taking pictures of the unmoving falcon, with his <br/>
wings spread and tail feathers spread and beak partly open (obviously <br/>
a threatening stance)and those enormous talons, wow he was a <br/>
breathtaker, and I am so excited I got pictures!! after a minute or <br/>
so my dog lunged on the falcon and it happened so fast I am not sure <br/>
exactly what happened but I remember the falcon flopped over on his <br/>
back, talons in the air, and tried to claw my dog while beating the <br/>
dogs head with its wings. I yanked my dog by the collar and pulled <br/>
him off, the bird hopped off its back and onto its legs again, and <br/>
assumed the fighting position again. Well we backed away from the <br/>
bird and I was worried that he was hurt and thats why he refused to <br/>
fly away, so I made my dog sit and walked up to the bird again and <br/>
veeery carefully, got within a foot of it and took a few more <br/>
pictures, and then backed away and with a long stick I touched his <br/>
legs and talons (I was worried he might be paralyzed or something) <br/>
and he then moved his feet so i figured he was ok, so I backed away <br/>
slowly, walked around the next bend in the trail, and then about 2 <br/>
minutes later walked back to where the bird had been to see if he was <br/>
still there, and he was gone, flew away. I thought the bird was hurt <br/>
or something but I guess not, he was just refusing to back away from <br/>
the fight and I guess thats why he wouldnt fight, BRAVE bird, <br/>
considering my dog is a mix of retriever and bull mastiff, he is not <br/>
a small dog!What a crazy experience! I am so excited to have gotten <br/>
pictures of that beautiful bird, and just so no one wonders, neither <br/>
the dog or the bird looked bloody or injured, I know my dogs fine, <br/>
but I think the bird is too, there was no bloodshed and no feathers <br/>
that I saw left behind.<br/>

You'd be as likely to find a grizzly bear at Paradise Lodge as a polar<br/>
bear, you know? No grizzlies in this part of the country unless they<br/>
escaped from a nearby zoo! ;o)<br/>

Ryan mentioned. If this wasn't an injured adult, then <br/>
it was most likely a juvenile just fledging. It may not <br/>
have been too good at flying yet and was just hopping <br/>
around on the ground. They do that. I would love to <br/>

would be never ever be found hiking alone and certainly wouldnt hike <br/>
as much as I do. I would be terrified to come across one of those <br/>
beasties. As for the pictures of the falcon I would be more than <br/>
happy to post them. I was however using slide film so one hour photo <br/>
is not an option, I took it straight to photo-den that day, so I <br/>
should get my slides back monday and then after that it might be a <br/>
week more until I can get prints from the slides, I am not too sure <br/>
how long it takes since this was my first time using slide film, but <br/>
Ill be sure to post them :) I know I got one of my dogs head (blurry) <br/>
and the falcon (in focus) side by side, but the others I got are just <br/>
of the bird, Ill be sure to post them as soon as I get them!! I think <br/>
you might be right, Funhog, maybe it was an adult fledgleing, because <br/>
it wasnt the biggest falcon I have seen, but it was still quite big, <br/>
but I just cant think of any reason why it wouldnt fly away and back <br/>
down from the fight, I have never even heard of a falcon attacking a <br/>
dog, so I just dont know what that bird was thinking. Good thing I <br/>
dont own a chiahuahua, he would have been bird food for sure!!  <br/>
Have fun out there on those trails! Oh and Ryan, glad to hear your <br/>
not chasing bears these days ;o) Im a shutterbug too, but I value my <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If it were, in fact, a fledgling, it very well COULDN'T fly <br/>
away. Birds like this are often brought in to rehabilitators <br/>
by kind souls who think they are helping. In fact, it's <br/>
usually better to leave the bird alone. The adults are <br/>
likely nearby, coming to feed it for a couple of days until <br/>
it figures out how to fly. The peregrines that nest on the <br/>
Fremont Bridge in Portland have had their young rescued <br/>
from the river below and the roadway by volunteers when <br/>
they failed to fly on their initial tries.  <br/>
<br/>
As for killing, as far as I know, these guys have to hit their <br/>
prey from the air. When they strike, their talons are built<br/>
to close on impact, piercing vital organs. Your dog could've <br/>
been 'footed' but not likely to have had a fatal injury from <br/>
a prone position. This is probably way more than you <br/>
wanted to know... but I am really curious to see those pics! <br/>

I think there's some famous saying about it is better to see a bear<br/>
running away from you than seeing a bear running towards you. Probably<br/>
one of those old Chinese proverbs you're always hearing about.<br/>
