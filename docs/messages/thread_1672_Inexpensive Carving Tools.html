for the Stamp Camp Starter kits... you need to look on Dick Blick for "lino<br>
cutters" and "pen nib holders" the handles should be about $.35 each and the<br>
blades should be relatively cheaper than when you buy then in the store and<br>
come in packs of 12.<br>
<br>
As for carving material -- the stamp camp kits came with Mastercarve --<br>
purchased at Columbia Art in Downtown Portland. -- I don't know for sure<br>
what Mitch uses in his kids carving -- it may be a little less advanced then<br>
the age level you are teaching, I know Mitch's instructions were geared for<br>
children that were not old enough to use sharp tools. (I am not sure if that<br>
is what you are looking for with girl scouts.) -- you should be able to<br>
order the tools from the kids relatively easy if you look for what I told<br>
you and spend some time on the site trying to find it.<br>
