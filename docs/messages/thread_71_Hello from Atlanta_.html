I didn't bother with the main letterboxing list because it's just too darned busy and know I won't have time to download all those messages.<br/>

Anyhow, I begin my hike tomorrow (Wednesay) morning!!!  Well, afternoon, most likely.  I just discovered about an hour ago that somehow, my bag of trail food snuck out of my pack and ran off back home to California.  Amanda says I just forgot it, but I can't believe that to be true....  Regardles, I've got some grocery shopping that needs to be done before heading to the trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I'm still keeping my eyes on you all.  *wink*  =)<br/>

Oh, about the Sigfreid &amp; Roy letterbox: I know Funhog has found it before, and one might try to sweet talk her into checking up on its status when she feels like stretching her legs.  And a bribe in the form of food or something wouldn't be out of the question.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, Canada Goose hasn't joined this board yet, which is a sad loss because then she could answer such a question directly.  I don't have access to her e-mail address from this campground, but if someone has it or is inclined to look for it, feel free to send her an e-mail to invite her!  I don't think she reads the main talk list very much and might have missed this list's birth announcement.  And her parents (Secret Garden) are certainly welcome too.  Granted, they live in Vancouver, Canada, but that's still technically part of the Pacific Northwest!<br/>
