It's almost time for the Spring Flinger on April 9th, at Priest Point <br/>
Park in Olympia!<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, 54 people have RSVP'd.woweeeee.  I'm sorry I <br/>
haven't been able to contact each one that is planning on attending, <br/>
but I am very much looking forward to meeting some of you and <br/>
catching up with those I already know.  Unfortunately, it looks like <br/>
Bethany won't be able to make it, but she has a REALLY good excuse! <br/>
<br/>
The park is gorgeous, and there is something for everyone.  Bring <br/>
your hiking boots as there are trails everywhere.  The park is <br/>
divided by East Bay Drive (with a bridge for foot and auto traffic <br/>
within the park).  On the north side of the park is where the rose <br/>
garden is, as well as multiple picnic tables.  There is also a drive <br/>
that goes up the hill and down past the maintenance facility and then <br/>
leads to the bridge.  On this drive are several small areas to park <br/>
in case you want to drive closer to some of the boxes in the park.  <br/>
AS ALWAYS:  Be careful when you are on the trailseven though this <br/>
park is in an suburban setting, some of the trails are very <br/>
secluded.  Bring a buddy!    On the south side of the park is where <br/>
the beach access is, as well as the PICNIC/KITCHEN #2.  Parking is <br/>
limited right at the shelter, so see if you can carpool and have a <br/>
designated `hoofer' to park the car.  The south side also has the <br/>
play equipment and the Ellis Cove Trail.   The trails on this side do <br/>
have some steep drop offs, so be mindful of the kids!<br/>
<br/>
The potluck is going to be "BUILD YOU OWN BAKED POTATO!!"  Please <br/>
bring your own dishes and utensils.  But we need people to bring <br/>
Baked Potatoes plus all the fixings.  Also we need some people to <br/>
bring canned pop or bottled water.  If you know what you are <br/>
bringing, please let me knowI will be keeping a running list on the <br/>
AQ event page.  The "kitchen" has only 1 outlet, but I'll try to <br/>
bring a outlet strip.  It also has a small sink, but a antiquated <br/>
wood burning stove.  But lots of space to sit and stamp!  <br/>
<br/>
Bring your camera, bring your gear, bring your potato and a bring <br/>
your rear!<br/>
<br/>
Hope the rest of your winter is wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
