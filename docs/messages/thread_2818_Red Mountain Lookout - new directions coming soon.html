REALLY bad the by the LB bug - he was thwarted last weekend by the<br>
setting sun and a gated road to my Red Mountain Lookout box, so he<br>
goes up there this weekend and hikes all the way around onto the<br>
Pacific Crest Trail and up there that way.  He kindly updated me on<br>
the condition of the road and the tower, took photos, and has agreed<br>
to provide hiking directions.  The road is gated now because of safety<br>
concerns since mother nature took the roof off the tower, and although<br>
one could hike up the road beyond the gate, it will be a much more<br>
beautiful hike via the PCT.  So watch for new hiking directions soon -<br>
I will post them alongside the original driving directions.  He says<br>
he thinks I am now the owner of my very first (and likely only)<br>
extreme letterbox, but it is still there safe and sound - woo-hoo! <br>
Thanks HM, you are a true friend. <br>

looking forward to looking for this letterbox, hopefully at the end of<br>
the summer. My hiking calendar is pretty full but I can always ask my<br>
boss for a day off for boxing. Thanks, Funhog<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a comment.  In June when we went up there it was gated but not locked.  The gate was only closed because a tree had landed on the hinged part of the gate in such a way that the gravity kept the gate closed.  Maybe they've locked it since then?  <br>
On the other hand we wouldn't recommend driving up that road unless you have a true 4 wheel drive, are into mud and scratched paint (I imagine the snow is melted by now (?)), and have a satelite phone to get out if you get stuck.  Cell phone service was non-exixtent.  We were able to drive within a mile of the top but I simply didn't have the stamina to hike it.  <br>
<br>
Funhog - if you're going to hike to this from the OR PCT allow extra time to get from OR to WA.   Tee hee.<br>
<br>
BTW - there was a Don and Gwen sighting this weekend!  Very fun!!<br>
