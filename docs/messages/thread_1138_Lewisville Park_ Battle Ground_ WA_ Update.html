I have updated the clues page to reflect *** reported missing - do <br>

I am sorry to here that this beautiful stamp will not be replaced. I <br>
beleive the only ones to have this gem in their possession is Team <br>
Run-A-Muck. We had to sneak behind a large group of young people who <br>
were in the immediate area doing thier baptism's in the river. We <br>
enjoyed some beautiful gospel singing while grabbing this box. I am <br>
very honored to have this stamp in my logbook and some great memories <br>
to go with it.<br>
