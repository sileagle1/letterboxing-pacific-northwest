&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was thinking...It seems as though most folks can make it either on<br/>
&gt; July 12th or 13th.  I was thinking about looking into renting a <br/>
group<br/>
&gt; camping area at Milo McIver State Park (Estacada area, I think).  I<br/>
&gt; believe the group camping area will take about 25 campers.  I have a<br/>
&gt; friend who works at for the State Parks Department and he's the one <br/>
who<br/>
&gt; told me about the possiblity of getting the group campsite.  I would<br/>
&gt; have to call State Parks and reserve it (as long as it's available).<br/>
&gt; I'd do it for the Friday and Saturday nights and we would have a <br/>
weekend<br/>
&gt; gathering and people could come and go as they please, throughout.  <br/>
What<br/>
&gt; do you think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd love some feedback on this.  I think there are at least 4<br/>
&gt; people/familiies who have mentioned camping there for the gathering.<br/>
&gt; This would be pretty nifty.  We'd all be kind of together and it <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; make camping and exchanging easy.  I'll look into it if there is <br/>
enough<br/>
&gt; interest.  We're thinking of taking a drive out to this park this<br/>
&gt; weekend to check it out.  I'm not sure if I've ever been there or <br/>
not.<br/>
&gt; It would give us the chance to see if we can land the Royal Angler<br/>
&gt; Letterbox, too.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me know what you all think!  Thanks so much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best regards,<br/>
