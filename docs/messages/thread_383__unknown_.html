> I'm taking my boys on a camping trip to the panhandle of Idaho.  I <br>
see that there are some boxes on the way but they are dated.  Does <br>
anyone know if the box hidden at Vantage, WA still exist?  <br>
<br>
Also if you happen to know of any boxes hidden in the Panhandle of <br>
Idaho, let me know.  The ones that I see listed are so old, I don't <br>
know if they are still there.  I don't want to turn my boys off <br>
before we even get started!  <br>
<br>
Also, if I hide boxes in places I won't get back to at least in long <br>
period of time like when I"m on travel trips and such, is that <br>
acceptable?  Or is is something I have to have access often to to do <br>
the upkeep?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help!<br>
