Actually, if I had bought one, I wouldn't have had 50 cents for a <br>

I'd be willing to send a self-addressed stamped envelope along with the <br>

Stupid showers. But as they say on the AT, it's okay to smell as long<br>
as you're camping. =)<br>

But seriously.... Amanda says she has some extra patches, so if you<br>
contact her at samanark@yahoo.com she can hook you up. ;o)<br>
