Hi All,<br>
<br>
We're heading out to my in-law's place on the Oregon Coast for <br>
Christmas next week. (Yachats, to be exact.) We're flying from Boise <br>
into Portland Wednesday morning the 22nd, renting a car, then <br>
driving down to the coast. We'll be heading near Salem, and down <br>
through Philomath, that general direction anyway. (Path could be <br>
altered slightly due to really tempting boxes or boxers. =)<br>
<br>
We have one or two stops in Portland before we head down, and <br>
weather and toddler permitting, I'd like to hit a few area <br>
letterboxes. I'd also love to meet up with any letterboxers on the <br>
way for an exchange. <br>
<br>
If you're not around Wednesday, we will be returning the Monday <br>
after Christmas, though we'll have a lot less time. I'll be checking <br>
letterboxing.org and Atlas Quest for boxes along the way. If you <br>
know of some special must-sees, I'd appreciate the heads-up. With <br>
the boy, I can't do any real hiking (that will be saved for another <br>
trip), but I do like a good mental puzzle box. Drive-bys are fine <br>
too for road trips!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Grifos<br>
