<br>
I'm finally checking the list.  I had gone no mail while we were in<br>
Canada and have been so busy the past week that I didn't get back to<br>
Daily Digests and reading past posts until today, finally.<br>
<br>
I am thankful to Jane, Chris, Pamela and Wes for hosting the First<br>
Canadian Thanksgiving!  And though, we were brief in our visiting, we<br>
were glad to see Team Garlic, Funhog, Iron Bear and Pandora, Ryan,<br>
Bethany, Regan, and Brennan.  I'm probably forgetting some folks.  I did<br>
see some new faces I didn't recognize and I'm sorry I didn't get to meet<br>
you!!!  We didn't even exchange with anyone.  Sorry about that!<br>
<br>
The gatheing was soggy, but very enjoyable!  It was great to see you<br>
all.  We did get there ver late, but managed to get a couple boxes after<br>
all.  The rain was pouring so hard that I didn't really want to<br>
letterbox too much and ruin Ryan's excellent event stamp in my logbook.<br>
Instead of letterboxing we went into Ft. Langley to enjoy their<br>
Cranberry Festival.  It was obvious the rain stopped no one from coming<br>
to that, as it was quite the well-attended affair.<br>
<br>
And thanks to Iron Bear, Pandora, Funhog and Ryan for allowing us to get<br>
together with them in the evening!  It was wonderful to get a real<br>
visit in under drier conditions!!!  <br>
<br>
And, yes, the kayaks did come off the car.  Sunday we went into<br>
Vancouver and put in on Granville Island and paddled all over False<br>
Creek, dodging water taxis, and aqua busses and just having a giggly<br>
good time paddling in an absolutely beautiful city!<br>
<br>
We did go back to Derby Reach on Monday to place and get one more<br>
letterbox before heading back to Oregon.  The weather was MUCH kinder to<br>
us on Monday and we had a very pleasant time!  I tried to post Fraser<br>
Valley Fall and Ft. Langely Visit letterboxes, but the database came<br>
back with an error so I will have to try again when I get to a "real"<br>
computer.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday Carie of Lennens 3 and I went out to get the magnificent<br>
"No Name Callng, Please".  We make a pretty good team, as she figures<br>
out the nasty mind-bending aspects of Der Mad Stamper's puzzling clues<br>
and I manage to navigate and direct us where we need to go once the<br>
clues are figured out.  Friends are a GOOD THING!!!<br>
<br>
It's so wonderful to see Der Mad Stamper back in action with his carving<br>
talents!  No more bogus foam stamps and once again we're all able to<br>
take his glorious name in vain actively once again when "Der Mad<br>
Stumper" places!!!  Yowza!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
