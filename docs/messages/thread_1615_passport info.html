We just renewed passports for the kids.  If your ducks are in a row <br/>
then at most it takes 3 weeks provided you use the 'rush' service.  If <br/>
there are extenuating circumstances (birth abroad without the original <br/>
birth certificate but only a previous passport and a certificate of <br/>
birth abroad issued by the consulate) then it takes about 5 weeks <br/>
provided you get the documents submitted in an expedited fashion.<br/>
<br/>
For a parent who plans to bring a child over the border while the <br/>
other parent doesn't accompany you, plan on either bringing a power of <br/>
attorney and/or a document signed/notarized by the non-traveling <br/>
parent that authorizes the other parent to take the child across the <br/>
border alone.  This is thanks to all of the intl kidnappings that seem <br/>
to occur in/outside the US these days.<br/>

There is a form on the Department of State web site in the passports area <br/>
for this purpose, if you need it (so that you make sure the letter has the <br/>
right info).<br/>
