and what a pleasant experience!  Found many incredible letterboxes <br>
around the southern Puget Sound region.  There has been a lot of box-<br>
planting activity in this region this past year and boy, do we have <br>
some incredible carving talent out there!  SoHillHendersons have been <br>
especially prolific!  What incredible venues you took us to today.  <br>
After 3+ years of letterboxing in this area we were starting to feel <br>
like we'd 'seen' everything already.  We sure were wrong!  We saw so <br>
many new things today we had no idea existed--it was definitely an eye-<br>
opener!  Who knew???<br>
<br>
That's the beauty of letterboxing!  It leads you to all these <br>
incredible nooks and crannies throughout the world you otherwise would <br>
have had no idea they even existed.<br>
<br>
Thanks for a great day & keep the awesome boxes coming!!!<br>
