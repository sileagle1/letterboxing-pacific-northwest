                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree! I haven't gone to find them yet, but have every intention of doing so because they sound really cool. I suppose we could get out there before Monday if you're gung-ho about pulling them, but I have some buddies here in Puyallup that I'm trying to get hooked on letterboxing and it would be a shame if they never got to see them! (Am I laying on enough guilt here?) Puh-leeeeeese reconsider! Preeeeeeety puh-leeeeeeeese! ;)<br/>
