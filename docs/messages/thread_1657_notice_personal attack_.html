                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know Amanda this is yet again one of those things where what I said is<br>
being taken completely out of the context it was said it.  The email first<br>
of all was not directed to you personally.  I was merely commenting on the<br>
email you wrote, that I took as a personal attack, which you didn't mean<br>
that way and explaining that I liked all aspects of letterboxing and<br>
explaining why I started the Cootie thing and noting that Cooties might seem<br>
silly to the average adult but that when you took the kids into<br>
consideration it gave it a whole different meaning.  Quite honestly, number<br>
one I didn't know you don't have any kids, I don't know you that well.  And<br>
number two -- I don't have kids. The children I was referring to were<br>
Maiden, Bethany and Camp Fire Lady's kids.  Further more Amanda, the slight<br>
you think I made at you, if you knew anything about me, would have been<br>
quite preposterous. If you recall I just had surgery last year. A surgery I<br>
struggled and cried many nights over because I had to make a choice as to<br>
whether or not I would improve the quality of mine and Iron`Bear's life by<br>
not having me doubled over in pain letting out blood curling screams on a<br>
daily basis, by giving up my ability to ever give him a child.  Imagine<br>
being faced with that choice a month after being married when your new<br>
husband has wanted a son all his life and has a beautiful child with his<br>
ex-wife.... so yeah, I understand.  Yet again the text medium has allowed<br>
you to take something that was in no way intended to be a slam or having an<br>
negative connotations whatsoever and think I was personally attacking you.<br>
<br>
Basic flaw of communication... what you just thought you heard isn't what I<br>
just thought I said.  Shame me all you want Amanda, but you're doing it for<br>
something I never meant.  If you took it as a personal attack and your<br>
feelings were hurt I truly apologize. Obviously as I have been in the same<br>
boat your post implies you might be in, I would never have said something<br>
like that. I don't make a habit out of being hurtful Amanda, I don't like<br>
seeing people hurt.<br>

could talk more and be there for each other as fellow LBers since you have more in common <br>

We tried everything (Invetro etc.) and nothing worked until we decided that we were meant to <br>
adopt. We have adopted 2 kids through the state. There are so many kids out there in need of <br>
good homes. Not saying that its for everyone- to each his own.-but it may be worth considering.<br>

Once again I am really sorry that the comment I made was taken this way.<br>
Whether people know it or not, Funhog and Amanda are two of the people I<br>
have a great deal of respect for in this hobby.  Granted I took Amanda's<br>
post about "what kind of letterboxer I was" as a slam and was defending<br>
myself, but I wasn't trying to attack anyone else, I was just admitting that<br>
if you didn't know why I created cooties and didn't have children I *could*<br>
understand how you might think they were silly. -- I can see how the comment<br>
about seeing them smile could be taken bad, but it wasn't meant that way, it<br>
was just a continuance of a thought.<br>
<br>
I really hope that someday in the near future we can all read one another's<br>
words and give them the benefit of the doubt that if it could be taken good<br>
or bad, it was meant good.  That we can read each others words and look for<br>
the best possible meaning instead of the worst.<br>
<br>
A text medium is a horrible place to communicate sometimes; we lose so much<br>
in voice and body language.  <br>
