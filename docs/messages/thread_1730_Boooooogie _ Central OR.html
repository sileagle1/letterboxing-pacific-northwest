Sounds like a missed a good one! Glad to hear that everyone had such a great time. <br/>
Although I wasn't able to make it, let it be known that I didn't let my letterboxing <br/>
boots gather dust. Well, they did gather dust but it was on the trail not in my closet. <br/>
<br/>
I managed to place two new boxes out at Crooked River Ranch and to find birder's <br/>
sneaky Waterfall box at Smith Rock SP. The fall weather in the high desert is <br/>
absolutely stunning with brilliant skies, lovely fall color and cooler temperatures. the <br/>
number of letterboxes is steadily growing thanks to 4Dtoes and birder. These folks <br/>
have been busy, bless their hearts! Funhog<br/>
