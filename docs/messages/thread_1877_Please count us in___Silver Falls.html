We would like to join in the Silver Falls gathering if there is still <br/>
room. There are 6 of us in our family and we would be able to stay <br/>
Fri, Sat, and Sun night. We would have a big tent and 1 vehicle which <br/>
since we have a Suburban we have extra space if anyone needs a ride. <br/>
Thanks and we are looking forward to meeting fellow letterboxers.<br/>
Happy Hunting..........The Nikander Family <br/>
(WE are trying to come up with a cool name for our family, hopefully <br/>
by the gathering which will then come a new stamp):)<br/>
