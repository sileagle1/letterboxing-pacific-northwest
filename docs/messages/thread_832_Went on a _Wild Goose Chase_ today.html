for about 3 years now, I have always wondered about placing boxes <br/>
there and always worried about them getting found or vandalized....  <br/>
It's a very busy place.  Never seemed to find a good hiding place <br/>
there, well, obviously I lacked in immagination, cause these are <br/>
really hidden quite well, and very fun!  <br/>
<br/>
We had almost as much fun sitting around waiting to replace them <br/>
talking to strangers passing by, as we did finding them.... Funny, we <br/>
brought our new digital camera, took tons of photos, a nutria was <br/>
right up on the grass and not bothered by us at all.  I got 3 feet <br/>
away and took some awesome detailed photos of it, well, at least I <br/>
thought I did until I turned the camera over to replay and discovered <br/>
the whole time there had not been a CF card in it! (it was still at <br/>
home in the card reader on our PC) Argh!  How embarrasing! Ak, having <br/>
to learn a new camera all over again!  Sheesh, some photographer I <br/>
AM! (really embarrased now)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway we had a very nice walk, on a fall day!  Looks like "A-Rock" <br/>
beat us to em just a couple of days before! Thanks mudstumpers!   <br/>
