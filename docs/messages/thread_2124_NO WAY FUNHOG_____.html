last <br/>
year. You may recognize his Route 66 sig stamp in the <br/>
local logbooks."<br/>
<br/>
I SAW THIS STAMP! and for the life of me I can't<br/>
remember which box but I saw it and immediately<br/>
coveted the thing.  I was jealous that I didn't think<br/>
of it because I just LOVE ROUTE 66!!!  I have the<br/>
metal road sign on my house and the sticker on my car<br/>
and the song in my head - oh, and a picture of me<br/>
standing on the route itself!<br/>
<br/>
WOW!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now you've peeked my interest though.  Oxbow #4 - no<br/>
clues - elusive......Hmmmmmm......I'd be interested to<br/>
know more about this.  I'll take a peek at LBNA and<br/>
see if I can figure out where a hint of this elusive<br/>
box is at.<br/>
<br/>
TeamWARE has one more year here before we move back to<br/>
Knoxville, TN where letterboxes are popping up more<br/>
and more but aren't abundant like they are here. <br/>
There are a few I MUST FIND before leaving this place:<br/>
<br/>
Maiden's Mother May I - series (have literally stood<br/>
on top of #1 five times - though it's been a year now<br/>
since - and still haven't found it though DMS says it<br/>
is there for sure).<br/>
<br/>
Ryans Crappy Stamp - only because the story that goes<br/>
with it is hilarious. (isn't that the one that Ryan<br/>
came upon that was in a box the size of a cake pan?)<br/>
<br/>
Maiden's TENNESSEE Walking Horse - for obvious<br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The original Columbia River Gorge Waterfall Series - I<br/>
adore DMS and want those x-acto knife carved stamps.<br/>
<br/>
The 45th Parallel - I'm not sure why I'm fascinated by<br/>
this but I am....oh, and the box that is in HALF,<br/>
Oregon or something like that. I found the clues once<br/>
but can't find them again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LILY<br/>
<br/>
If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br/>
