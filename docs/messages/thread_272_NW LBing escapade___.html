process--this weekend!!! Yippee!!!!  Of course, the orca calf was <br/>
dead (no fun in that) washed ashore on the beach, the Black Bear was <br/>
timid (thankfully, but I wasn't quick enough with my camera <br/>
nonetheless) and the Bald Eagles were gorgeous.<br/>

Placed another box along the way. Stay tuned for new clues.<br/>

Caffeine, perhaps?  Actually, I prefer caffeine-free chai tea soy <br/>
lattes...  Chocolate, hmmmm?<br/>

As for the bear, that was my first bear in the wild since seeing <br/>
them dumpster dive at Yellowstone in 1981 (I guess that dates me, <br/>
doesn't it?)!!!<br/>
