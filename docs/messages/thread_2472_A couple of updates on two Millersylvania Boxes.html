managed to attempt (by memory) looking for a couple I found during <br>
FF@ and my last trip to the park in Nov 2004. <br>
<br>
I did check on "Hiss" for Lily and did some maintenence on it for <br>
her. It has been visited several times this past year by new <br>
letterboxers. <br>
<br>
I stopped by the Hogwart's Hitchiker Hostel and noted that it hasn't <br>
been visited since MomNoTime and myself were there in Nov 2004 so I <br>
pulled the three hitchikers out of it and will try to get them moved <br>
to a more active box. The Hostel itself is in great shape for being <br>
where it is and amazingly hadn't been tampered with at all. But I <br>
don't think there are any clues for this Hostel online anywhere <br>
which may be the contributing factor as to why it hasn't been <br>
utilized.<br>
<br>
I tried finding "Love at First Byte" but couldn't find the log I <br>
remember sitting on to stamp in that logbook. But I also hadn't <br>
received Maiden's message that it was no longer there until today. <br>
<br>
I also looked for the box (can't remember the boxes name now) that <br>
was placed for FF2 and located in the chimney of the fairy mound by <br>
the BathHouse.Couldn't find it anywhere and we checked every stump <br>
and the knocked over rotting stump in the general area. I remember <br>
finding this box at FF2 and thinking gosh this was an easy one.<br>
<br>
We will be out there again this coming weekend so I'll try to check <br>
the status of a couple more boxes.<br>
