                    <div class="plaintext-content">While the appeal of geocaching escapes me, I feel compelled to come to the defense <br>
of those who enjoy that pastime. I have seen letterbox sites that were trashed in <br>
much the same way as described in RayvenDad's missive (eg. PCC Sylvania before <br>
Ryan replaced the stamp, Fallen Feather at B-V Trail) and I have happened upon <br>
caches that were well hidden with no immediate damage. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, the real problem is that geocaching has a much larger following. As a <br>
result, caches get more traffic, both pinheads and eco-friendly folks. The numbers <br>
alone end up causing more destruction. Frequently visited boxes in New England, <br>
letterboxing central, sometimes have trails blazed right to them.<br>
<br>
I have personally had two very positive interactions with geocachers. In both <br>
instances, they have found my letterboxes out in the open, rehidden them and <br>
contacted me to let me know about their status. One of my regular Lb IM buddies <br>
lives in Nebraska where there are few boxes and fewer boxers. In self defense, he is a <br>
geocacher and makes every effort to introduce his cohorts to the fine hoby of <br>
letterboxing.<br>
<br>
We are very lucky to have a small, respectful group of letterboxers here in the PNW <br>
but I don't think we are without blame. I know that the geocaching.com advocates the <br>
same treatment of the environment that we do. Food for thought... Funhog<br>
