the people that we meant were great... Found lots of nice <br/>
letterboxs, and made new friends... Sorry I havent had time to write <br/>
I have been so busy sense I got home... We are going to plan another <br/>
trip that way this June... And we will have more time to spend down <br/>
that way... And be able to get more and new boxes....  I wanted to <br/>
thank Bindle Babe for letting us come to her hotel and have <br/>
breakfast with her...  I also wanted to thank, Maiden, cats Meow, <br/>
Camp Fire Lady,Willow, Daisy and Heartsey,Tooth Fairy, and many more <br/>
