The good news is that the second log scroll, the one that got all <br/>

safely in a drawer at home.<br/>

I'm sorry to report that I am unaware of any plot to kidnap the <br/>
Chief... but it's nice to be a suspect.  If you ask me, this box was <br/>
begging for mis-chief from the beginning.  If nothing else, you've <br/>
got the rest of us scheming to out minimize the clue...<br/>
<br/>
So far as Ryan's musings on clueless clue theory... he's technically <br/>
right.  But I believe that I have a perfect cluelessly clued box (or <br/>
two).  I'll compromise it in the interest of clue science (and since <br/>
none of you will likely ever be in Quebec).  It is possible to create <br/>
a clueless clue simply by placing a box in the way of people, so that <br/>
they stumble on it while looking for something else.  (A tactic I've <br/>
also employed with clue dissemination, but I regress (that right... <br/>
re- try Altavista).)<br/>
<br/>
Check out the clue for the "Pink Bullet" in Quebec.  I've got a box <br/>
in the cannon right next to it (which you naturally encounter first <br/>
while searching) that has a stamp of a bullet, housed in a pink <br/>
travel mug... the Pink Herring.<br/>
