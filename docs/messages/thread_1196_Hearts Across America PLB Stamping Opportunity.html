The "Hearts Across America" box has made its way from Montana, <br/>
Conneticut and Team Rayvenhaus to me! We were hoping it would get <br/>
here in time for the Leap Day Event but due to a mailing snafu <br/>
between MT and CT it was delayed. I have been given permission to get <br/>
as many stamps as possible into it while it is in my care. I will be <br/>
available at noon on Sunday at Wapato Park for anyone who wants to <br/>
meet me and stamp in it. I plan on arriving there early to finish <br/>
finding some of the letterboxes that are there. I also am going to <br/>
check and see if a couple of hitchhikers that my daughter and I <br/>
launched from there back on Jan. 2 have started moving..if not I"m <br/>
going to pull them and replace them elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
So...if you wan't to get the "Hearts Across America" stamp meet me at <br/>
the kitchen shelter at Noon. I'll hang around til 1pm then I"m off to <br/>
go inquire about permission to place a mystery box at an undisclosed <br/>
location in Tacoma that was given to me by BindleBabe last month for <br/>
planting.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we will see some of you there! If not sorry...the box will be <br/>
mailed out first thing (7am) Monday morning!<br/>
<br/>
Til later,<br/>
