<br/>
Just had a whirlwind vacation down the coast. Went Deep Sea Fishing, Whale Watching, <br/>
sand castle building, Sandsurfing and a bunch more stuff... Oh ya, and we went <br/>
Letterboxing! I think we got to squeeze 11 letterboxes in  almongst all the other activities. <br/>
We stayed at 4 State Parks and left a little something at our last stop. We heard <br/>
HeronaFoot needed something to look for. Unfortunately we didn't have time to get her <br/>
boxes in Florence or arrange a meeting... maybe next time. Enjoy the new box, and keep <br/>
us informed as to it's condition as we live in Central Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>

Oh how I wish I could be there - you wouldn't need to lure me at all.<br/>
 I love Camp Sherman and the Metolius and use almost any excuse to go<br/>
there.  My dilema is, I am leaving to visit my daughter in Montana 2<br/>
days after the gathering.  Finding it hard to justify driving over and<br/>
back and then 2 days later driving the same way again.<br/>
<br/>
If I don't make it you can visit my Dee Wright Observatory box and<br/>
think of me.  That is such a fascinating place and while you are in<br/>
that area see if you can locate artTrekker's  Mystery box named<br/>
"Scenic Byway".  She carves some great stamps. <br/>
