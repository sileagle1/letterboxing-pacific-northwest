                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good Topic! Okay, here are my useful and un-useful tools:<br/>
<br/>
I actually have 4 useful tools that I pretty much always use:<br/>
1. A piece of black felt for those two sided stamps that Maiden and <br/>
Pupp are notorious for. It helps to keep my hands clean and for some <br/>
reason, the ink doesn't rub off of the felt and onto my hands. <br/>
(must be magic).<br/>
2. A flashlight. I have had to really dig some well-hidden boxes out <br/>
of deep dark places lately.<br/>
3. Lots and lots of extra baggies! Since the weather is very soggy <br/>
here now-a-days, so are many of the stamps and logbooks.<br/>
4. A piece of plastic to lay down when I want to sit on a log or put <br/>
my letterboxing gear down. Another great tool in soggy weather.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I spent good money on and always stays home:<br/>
My walking stick. I saw someone else with one and had to have one. <br/>
Now I just find a stick on the trail and use that. There are plenty <br/>
out there on the trails.<br/>

<br/>
A monocular, a digital camera, halogen flashlight &amp; <br/>
single 'foxglove' glove.  I never leave home without the first two <br/>
of these, never go LBing without all four.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Least useful item?<br/>
<br/>
GPS.  DH bought me one a few months after I started LBing, used it <br/>
twice and then it was stolen when our car was broken into.  Never <br/>
found a need for it when letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Example of the monocular can be seen here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.birdwatchersgarden.com/index.asp?<br/>
PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=330<br/>
<br/>
I purchased mine at a market in Seoul but this is close to what it <br/>
looks like.  I love it!  I use it all the time especially <br/>
birding/boat watching along the water--even when I'm stuck <br/>
in traffic/stoplights to investigate things further beyond <br/>
traffic/signs, etc.  Comes in really handy!<br/>

of my letterboxing away from home, it is really important for me to<br/>
have a good street map to navigate my way from Park to Park!<br/>
Especially when the letterboxing clues are nebulous or mysterious! A <br/>
map of the park also helps to interpret clues.<br/>
<br/>
Duct Tape is a nice thing to have along too, A little bit can help to<br/>
mend a broken or cracked box!  <br/>
<br/>
What I don't need so much: my compass. It spends most of its time in<br/>
the bottom of my bag and it really doesn't work well anyway as it<br/>
always has a bubble in it. I always get a compass with a bubble in it!<br/>
aaaargh. Unless I am doing Compass Conundrum clues from Mapsurfer or<br/>
Green Torture, I mean Tortuga, then I find I can get along without it.<br/>
