                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today was a day to do some long distance maintenance. <br/>
The primary goal was the Mill Creek 45th Parallel box. <br/>
The last couple of finders had let me know that the <br/>
logbook was full to overflowing and I knew that I needed <br/>
to get down there and replace it. However, if I was driving<br/>
all the dang way to Salem and beyond, I figured I may as <br/>
well pick up/check on a box or three along my route.<br/>
<br/>
I found three of my boxes, Bluebird Trail, Bald Peak and <br/>
Mill Creek all faring fine. I tracked down Douglas Fir and Minto <br/>
Brown Island but failed miserably with Here Fishy, Fishy. With<br/>
the last, I never found the marked log, wasn't sure about which<br/>
sign was more baffling than another and never found a tree<br/>
with a rock at its base. There was one last tree that could've<br/>
been the correct one but there were five, count 'em five, <br/>
people enjoying the lovely Willamette near the base of that tree. <br/>
There was no way I could ever get close. Sigh...<br/>
<br/>
Of the five boxes I visited today, three had standing water in<br/>
them. I am here to testify that ziplock baggies are the greatest!<br/>
Not one of the books was damaged by water. I poured out the <br/>
water, dried the insides, double bagged anything that wasn't <br/>
already, I want to thank all the letterboxers who have taken <br/>
such good care resealing the bags in my boxes and those<br/>
belonging to other folks. Funhog<br/>
