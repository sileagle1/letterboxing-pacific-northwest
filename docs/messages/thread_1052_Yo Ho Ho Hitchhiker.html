                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all! <br>
<br>
I picked up a VERY interesting hitchhiker today, it was started by a kindergartner in Olympia, WA.  He wanted to combine his love of geocaching and letterboxing so he dropped this hitchhiker into his geocache.  Unfortunately, the original stamp is no longer with the log book.  There is a stamp in it, but not the original.  The first few people that moved it were geocachers so I think the original stamp may have gotten switched with the box stamp they left it in.. not quite understanding what to do.  Has anyone in the Olympia area found a stamp that doesn't match the box its in? I'm going to plant the hitchhiker tomorrow unless someone happens to know where the original stamp is.. if so I'll hang on to it and maybe we can get both stamps back to their rightful homes. <br>
<br>
I also released a hitchhiker of my own today.. the Back to School Hitchhiker.  I released it in memory of my now dearly departed free time ;) I start back to school on Monday to get my degree.  I'm going to let it travel until I get my degree, about 15 months from now and then recall it. <br>
<br>
While doing all of this I ALSO made a slight adjustment to the placing of the third box in my circus memories box.  It's location wasn't the greatest.  I'll adjust the clues on the web site tonight, but if you're carrying around the old ones they wont' get you there anymore! <br>

It has been in the Lying Man Letterbox. It was then moved to the Olympia West Travel Bus Hotel Geocache. From there it traveled to the Olympia Brew House letterbox.  It went from there to Cannon Beach. From Cannon Beach to Sisters, Sisters to Gresham.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is.. all the actual letterboxes that it has resided in are stamped in and the stamps don't match. <br>
<br>
I just did some checking on the Olympia West Travel Bus geocache and it seems it's basically a "hitchhiker" cache.  The person only leaves "traveling" caches in it and you're supposed to take one and leave one.  I wonder how many hitchhikers have inadvertently made their way into that particular cache.. especially since it seems to be in the same park, if not at the same location as the Lying Man letterbox. <br>
<br>
I'm beginning to think finding this particular stamp again is going to be difficult, if not impossible.  If so should we attempt to relicate the original stamp?<br>

  log on opposite sides of it (about 2' apart).  Yes, most c*achers <br>
  find the letterbox first then find their 'prize' when they realize <br>
  the letterbox isn't their 'goal'.  However, there aren't that many <br>
  folks active in letterboxing in this region so I can't imagine that <br>
  it's happened to many HHs (they're few & far between in these <br>
  parts).  I'd guess this is probably the only instance.  You know--it <br>
  may, indeed, be the correct stamp for the HH anyway--as it looks <br>
  quite similar to the placer's signature stamp.  I even think I <br>
  recall them mentioning the HH being a LB instead of a 'prize' when <br>
  they posted it to the TB c*ache.<br>
<br>
  But then again, who knows?<br>
