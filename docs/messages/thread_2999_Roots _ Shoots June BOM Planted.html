                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tonight I was able to plant Roots and Shoots Redmond's "Wonderstruck" June 2012 Box of the Month.  Because the logbook is gigantic I opted to plant the enormous stamp with index cards.  Please stamp on one side of the index cards only and I will cut and paste the images into the logbook.  As a reminder this image is very large.  Please bring an 8  x 11 sheet of paper or cardstock to capture the image.  A big juicy ink pad and plan on taking the box to your car do you can stamp on a flat surface. You may need several attempts to stamp a clean image so multiple sheets of paper or cardstock are recommended.<br>
