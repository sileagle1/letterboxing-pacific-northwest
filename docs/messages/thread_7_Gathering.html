&gt; I think it was you at Spirit of Dartmoor, Having lived in Europe for a bit, I somtimes flip the date sequence MM-DD-YY to DD-MM-YY and trying to be discreet I just speed read the entries.  We may try Council Crest again.  Marquam Trail is a nice city walk anyway.  Thank you!<br/>

&gt; (I guess things grow smaller!) and completely waterlogged when we <br/>
&gt; got it about a year ago. It shouldn't have been hard to find though, <br/>
&gt; not a tricky box. Perhaps someone put finally it out of its misery.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That was probably me that was last at Spirit of Dartmoor, though it <br/>
&gt; was in November. Maybe I wrote the wrong date down.<br/>

&gt; I'm so glad somebody finally grabbed the klingon!  I had a heck of a <br/>
&gt; time trying to squeeze it into the letterbox and was concerned that <br/>
&gt; it wasn't 'camouflaged' with it wrapped around.  The only reason I <br/>
&gt; left it was I knew that myriad lb'ers were planning on looking for <br/>
&gt; it in the very near future.  Glad the box is back to its normal well-<br/>
&gt; camouflaged self!<br/>

&gt; This morning, just before I left home, I got a call from the office that the<br/>
&gt; power was out, all over the neighborhood.  If I wanted, I could come in<br/>
&gt; later.  So I did!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Went to Lois Lake Park and Nature Trial, was first at Jo the Alien, Fresh<br/>
&gt; Fruit, and the Carrot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still some time left, so went over to Wonderwood to get the Pencil and Bill<br/>
&gt; the Upside Down Robot (at least that is how he is in my logbook :-(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very nice stamps, great locations.  Recommend them highly to everyone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good job, Mo!  Looking forward to more of your good work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Was first in Lois Lake, but was behind Bill and Glenn at Wonderwood Park.<br/>
&gt; Nothing to be ashamed of following such expert 'boxers.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We're working together on a series in Salem, OR.  It will be an<br/>
&gt; &gt; "in-progress" series, and we will be adding to it until May 2006 <br/>
&gt; or so<br/>
&gt; &gt; (when we graduate).  There are a few things about this series that <br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; it very different from other boxes:<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1.	This is an "in-progress" series, so we'll be adding to it as <br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; go.  Hopefully there will be at least four boxes in the series by <br/>
&gt; May<br/>
&gt; &gt; 14th, when we go home for the summer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.	 Each box must be found to even get the clue for the next.  <br/>
&gt; This<br/>
&gt; &gt; means that we will be maintaining the boxes very carefully, so no <br/>
&gt; dead<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes!<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3.	The clues are insanely hard-so you get to meet us when you <br/>
&gt; need<br/>
&gt; &gt; a hint.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; The series is posted on the new LBNA site and at Wizbang's <br/>
&gt; letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; site:  http://www.willamette.edu/~alorente/letterboxing/<br/>

&gt; Wanted to let you know we stopped briefly on Boise on our way home <br/>
&gt; from Utah last Saturday. We had a great time playing on the rocks <br/>
&gt; and looking at the fish at the Depot. "A Single Rose" was alive and <br/>
&gt; well. I will be going through again in June and plan to stop for <br/>
&gt; more boxes. It is a great reason to stop and stretch on that long 12 <br/>
&gt; hour drive to Grandmas house. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi--another wild letterboxing day in WA!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***Adventures***<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; We set out to find Mo's 5 new boxes today down in Lacey, WA.  We <br/>
&gt; found them all in great shape!  What cute little stamps and boxes, <br/>
&gt; too!  The Carrot was a milestone for us as it was our 350th find!!! <br/>
&gt; Thanks Mo for a great box--we'll have to celebrate with <br/>
&gt; steamed/glazed carrots this evening!  ;)  Lois Lake Park was really <br/>
&gt; neat--it's crazy, we've driven all around Lacey over the past <br/>
&gt; several years but have never seen that particular park before.  <br/>
&gt; That's why letterboxing is so cool--it takes you to new and <br/>
&gt; interesting places around your town that you never knew about!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just as we finished finding the 3 boxes there, an adult Bald Eagle <br/>
&gt; swooped right down over us and then took off to the tree tops.  What <br/>
&gt; an incredible sight!  Unfortunately, I couldn't get my camera out <br/>
&gt; quick enough to get a good picture.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***Misadventures***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We then headed out to Wonderwood Park (a park we've visited about 4 <br/>
&gt; times in the last 3 weeks prior to today).  We soon find the <br/>
&gt; Pencil.  Then, we wander around to find the Robot.  Just as we are <br/>
&gt; looking under the log for the letterbox, an armed police officer <br/>
&gt; calls us from about 20' away asking us to leave the park ASAP!  <br/>
&gt; Seems they had had a report of an armed hostage taker somewhere <br/>
&gt; within the park's grounds.  So, we didn't even get a chance to sign <br/>
&gt; in (at first).  We hightail it out of the park but have to hang out <br/>
&gt; at the baby's playground because our car was on the other side of <br/>
&gt; the park.  We notice half a dozen police sweeping through the park <br/>
&gt; with rifles in hands.  Wow!  We don't know if they found anything <br/>
&gt; during their sweep--I figured if there was something, we'd hear <br/>
&gt; about it in the news.  About an hour later, we were given the all <br/>
&gt; clear and headed back to the box to stamp in.  Talk about an <br/>
&gt; adventure!  Pt Defiance Park, Priest Point Park, Wonderwood Park, <br/>
&gt; etc...  Are we just police activity magnets or what?  I'm really <br/>
&gt; thinking about changing our handle...  By the way, Mo we really <br/>
&gt; enjoyed your stamps there, too!<br/>

&gt; today.  We just had to get Paisley Orca's recent addition--whadda great <br/>

&gt; Wild Woman!!!  I'm so glad you guys found this box!  Were you the first<br/>
&gt; to stamp in?  The stamp is of the view of the ferry from the Wilsonville<br/>
&gt; side, but I couldn't do the directions from there because the ferry<br/>
&gt; isn't always in operation.  I tried to carve it from a photo from that<br/>
&gt; view.  I'm glad you and Heather and the kids enjoyed yourself.  Molalla<br/>
&gt; River is an excellent kid and dog running park to be sure!  I'm honored<br/>
&gt; and happy that you went seeking and found this box.  I hope others do<br/>
&gt; the same.<br/>
&gt; Funhog's Bluebird box is very nearby at Champoeg.  It's not a wimpy<br/>
&gt; drive-by like my box, but certainly a worthwhile stamp and hike.  By the<br/>
&gt; way...Did you take the ferry?  It was only $1.25 when we went a few<br/>
&gt; months back.  What a nice little trip through rural America.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hey Everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm thinking it might be about time for another Letterboxing gathering<br/>
&gt; in the Portland area.  It's been a while.  We had a wonderful gathering<br/>
&gt; in Portland in August 2002 at Upper MacLeay Park organized and hosted by<br/>
&gt; Funhog, which was a blast.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In November 2002 Bethany, a.k.a. Dvntrcker or however she spells it,<br/>
&gt; hosted an event that exceeded expectation, food, and letterboxing fun in<br/>
&gt; the Olympia/Tacoma area!!!  (South Sound Chili is outstanding and easy,<br/>
&gt; by the way!)  Lots of great letterboxers showed up for that and God<br/>
&gt; blessed us with a beautiful day and a wonderful view of Mt. Rainier.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm thinking Oxbow Park in the Gresham/Boring area might be a good place<br/>
&gt; to host.  It does cost an admission fee of $3 per car, though, unless<br/>
&gt; you have a Metro Parks pass, and if that is cost-prohibitive I'd be<br/>
&gt; willing to take other suggestions.  There are two letterboxes there<br/>
&gt; already -- Cara's Oxbow Letterbox #1 -- (#2 has been missing forever)<br/>
&gt; and Funhog's Riverbend Box.  It's a large and wonderful park that would<br/>
&gt; have lots of good hiding of letterbox opportunities.  It is right on the<br/>
&gt; Sandy River, too, for those who enjoy canoeing, kayaking, innertubing or<br/>
&gt; swimming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd appreciate input on what you think of the idea and appropriate dates<br/>
&gt; for such an event.  The end of July is out for me, otherwise, I'm open<br/>
&gt; to all ideas.<br/>

&gt; We were indeed the first to stamp in--and we encourage all to follow!  (One <br/>
&gt; of the kids dropped the box &amp; it tumbled down the bank toward the river--but <br/>
&gt; I'm happy to report that it didn't make it all the way, so it's safe &amp; <br/>
&gt; sound--and dry--and awaiting its next visitors.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have to admit that we were fixated on that new stamp--we ran out there and <br/>
&gt; ran right back home--no extra time for a fun ferry ride, no Champoeg.  But I <br/>
&gt; want to get out there again to check out that Fir Grove trail (both for fun <br/>
&gt; and, of course, for possible future LB sites), when I have time for a longer <br/>
&gt; visit.  Thanks for getting us out there!<br/>

&gt; city.  I sure like it better than St. Louis.  Just my opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best regards,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In some of the first messages when this list was new, I'd asked about a <br/>
possible Canadian gathering (because I'd read that suggestion in the LbNA <br/>
archives).  Nobody jumped on that idea--maybe the originators of that idea <br/>
were not yet signed on--but Ryan did suggest I was welcome to host one <br/>
myself.  As a result of that discussion, Jill, Jess &amp; myself offered to host <br/>
in the Portland area.  But, speaking only for myself, I'm delighted to see <br/>
that Paisley is willing to take the lead instead.  :o) <br/>
<br/>
So let's continue trying to sort this out--is a BC gathering still a <br/>
possibilty?<br/>

Kamloops sometime between 8/15 and 8/24 would be cool ...<br/>

&gt; and folks wanted to wait for summer I seem to recall. But ya know either <br/>
&gt; way if it is in Portland I will be there most likely. Aug 18th ish is bad <br/>
