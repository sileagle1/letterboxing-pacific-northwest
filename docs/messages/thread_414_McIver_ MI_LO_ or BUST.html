This letterbox was originally created for the Upper Great Lakes<br>
Gathering in Michigan during the spring of 2003. After its short stay<br>
there, it made its way back to Oregon and was set free here during the<br>
Rubber Stamp Campout 2003.<br>
<br>
Park at the Milo McIver Viewpoint parking lot. Enjoy the view and<br>
greet Milo. While learning of his good works you will notice several<br>
dates. Take note of ALL the dates on the plaque, large and small. Add<br>
them together. From the resulting sum, eliminate the first two digits<br>
and add the last two. Later, you will need the resulting number to<br>
count your steps to the letterbox.<br>
<br>
Facing Milo's visage, follow the rock wall to the left until it ends<br>
and then turn right onto a dirt trail. Follow this path as it skirts<br>
the meadow and borders the woods. When you meet another dirt trail,<br>
turn left and head downhill. At  signs of equus keep to the right.<br>
When you meet a stump standing beside the trail, walk twice the number<br>
of steps you determined at the beginning.  Around the bend you will<br>
meet Holly standing before a nursemaid with a ruddy complexion. The<br>
letterbox hides behind the larger of the two.<br>
