                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sunday proved to be a wonderful day to set a new personal <br>
letterboxing record with 21 finds in one day and boy am I feeling it <br>
this morning!<br>
Cat's Meow and I picked up Maiden and Tooth Fairy and headed out to <br>
Eagle Fren Park in Estacada. While waiting for others to arrive, we <br>
picked up Morning Ritual. As we headed back to the car we were met by <br>
Pandora, Iron Bear, Bookworm and Sleepy Whippet. We located Buffalo <br>
Baby and sat down to do some stamping into a few Postal Letterboxes <br>
and Hitch Hikers. After passing out some much needed trail mix, we <br>
started our power boxing journey. We found all 6 of the Farm Friends <br>
Series and were firsties to these boxes. Next, we went for the Triple <br>
Trouble 3 and found only 2 and caught Whippet Litter- Fishing Whippet <br>
as we were leaving the park to meet up with The Ravenhaus clan at <br>
Milo McIver Park. After lunch and finding out that they were not <br>
going to show, we picked up Protection and headed out for the <br>
Jurassic Park Series of 5 and were successful in finding them all. <br>
Next on to the Making Faces Series. After many encounters with <br>
Stinging Nettle and being pretty worn out by now, we were only <br>
successful in finding 3 out of 5. Wild Woman, I beleive the "eyes" <br>
have gone missing and the "nose" was pretty elusive. Lastly we picked <br>
up Clackamas River to conclude our power boxing trip with some sore <br>
feet and muscles but all in all a great day for boxing and meeting up <br>
with good friends. I can't wait to do it all again!<br>
