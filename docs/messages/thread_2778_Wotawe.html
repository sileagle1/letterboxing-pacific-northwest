                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday morning, May 1st, our dog Wotawe had some sort of seizure and<br>
passed away at the veterinary hospital.  We don't understand the reason for<br>
her sudden illness, it was completely unexpected.  Many of you met her at<br>
the Spring Flinger event, others met her at the Oregon Luau and were lucky<br>
enough to get her personal stamp.  I know she had a wonderful time meeting<br>
all of you and loved all the attention and love you gave her.<br>
<br>
We had ten wonderful years with her.  We're grateful that her last few days<br>
were spent doing what she loved best, being outside, camping, and making new<br>
friends.  Her absence has left a huge hole in our lives that can never be<br>
filled.<br>
<br>
Our memories of her are all we have now.  She always seemed to have an<br>
impact on those she met, even for a short time.  If you have any memories,<br>
impressions, or thoughts of her you'd like to share, send them to us by<br>
email and we will put them up on her personal traveler page.<br>
<br>
For now, her stamp will be retired.  She carried it herself, and neither of<br>
us are ready to carry it for her.  Someday we'll carry it as a memorial to<br>
her, but for now it just hurts too much.<br>
<br>
Give your pets a hug tonight and tell them you love them.<br>

While I was petting Wotawe at the Luau, she scooched right up and <br>
leaned against my leg.  Bliss for both of us. I enjoyed meeting her and <br>
loved that she was 'a leaner'.  What a sweetie.<br>
<br>
Your memories of Wotawe will help you celebrate having her as a friend <br>
and keep her in your heart.<br>

We had the pleasure of meeting her at the Luau also and my kiddos all<br>
fell in love with her...especially my Hungry Peanut (3 yrs old).  She<br>
was the sweetest little doggie.  My kiddos had fun hiding a cootie in<br>
her little  stamp carrying case and I heard over and over again how<br>
cool they thought it was that she carried her own stamp.  (and it WAS<br>
very cool!)<br>
We will miss her right along with you and we can't wait to see you<br>
again.  Until then, all 6 of us give you a cyber hug...{{{{{{singing<br>

memories with her helps ease your sadness.<br>
