                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here I was all set to attend the great Leap Year gathering in Tacoma, <br/>
and I wake up with a serious case of strep throat spending the <br/>
morning looking for a doctor's office that is actually open on a <br/>
Sunday.  Do these people not realize that people still get sick even <br/>
on weekends?!!!  And NONE of the places I called even listed the days <br/>
or hours they were open.  Argh!<br/>
<br/>
But, I'm happy to report, I'm now taking drugs (weeeee!), but missed <br/>
the gathering.  (waaaaaa!)  What a beautiful day for it as well.  <br/>
Stupid infections.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I hope you all managed to enjoy yourself even without my <br/>
illustrious precense.  I know it couldn't have been easy, but I'd <br/>
hate to think I had something to do with the gathering being a <br/>
failure.  ;o)<br/>

Defiance today and what a wonderful time we had. It was so good to see our<br/>
friends again and to be able to make new ones as well.  We took pictures,<br/>
and they will be available in the Gallery section within a few days.<br/>
<br/>
MiniBullyMom and dvn2ckr, I want to thank you for coordinating and planning<br/>
this one, it was wonderful!  You guys are the greatest!<br/>
<br/>
And no, somehow things managed to lumber along without you there Ryan. Can't<br/>
imagine why though!  (chuckles)<br/>
