<br/>
She logged in at the BrewHaus at Tumwater Historical Park, Yashiro at the Olympia Japanese Gardens, and the Turtle, Hippo, Gator and Bat at Harry Fain's Legion Park.  Also got her first hitchhiker, I Love You.  <br/>
<br/>
She had a great time!  Being unsteady on her feet, may not get too many, but enjoys our great hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully didn't keep anyone from getting Harry's Gator and Bat.  We got them, logged in, and three families showed up to play in the playground.  We couldn't outwait them, so went to dinner and put them back later.  If you were there and didn't find them, our apologies :-)<br/>

We were first at Yashiro.  There was a guy sitting on the bench by pond,<br/>
doing some sunning, lunching, and writing (or some work-like activity).  As<br/>
we wandered around, he finally asked if we wanted his bench.  We said no,<br/>
sorry for interrupting.  Nice quiet spot, in perfect condition.<br/>
<br/>
The HH was well hidden, but I can see where the big box may be worrisome to<br/>
hide.  The other item you noted was still there.  Some people are strange.<br/>
<br/>
Made a note that the gator had been chased off by a bat.  Finally the clues<br/>
made sense, went right to it.  How did you ever find that location?<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the specifics of the South Sound Gathering, Mummsy may join us,<br/>
see that letterboxers are quasi-normal people.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great boxes!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; What an awesome way to celebrate Mother's Day!  Hopefully, we'll<br/>
&gt; have a new letterboxing addict!  ;)  I've spoken to several older<br/>
&gt; persons about the hobby and many seem very interested in<br/>
&gt; letterboxing--especially when you discuss how so many boxes are tied<br/>
&gt; to historical things or passions such as gardening, animals,<br/>
&gt; interesting locations, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Glad you nabbed the HH, I was a bit nervous about its vulnerability<br/>
&gt; there in that spot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the update!  I assume your's was the maiden visit to<br/>
&gt; Yashiro Pagoda?  How was the garden looking--they've been<br/>
&gt; frantically getting it ready for the warm season!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for bat &amp; gator--fortunately, it's not a 6 mile hike to reach<br/>
&gt; them in the event you have to return...  ;)  That happened to us on<br/>
&gt; Denny Creek Trail last week--we found 2 boxes on the trail of 4 but<br/>
&gt; hit snow way too deep to continue without crampons, rope &amp; gore-tex<br/>
&gt; body suits!  Maybe later...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have a great day &amp; see you on the trail.  BTW, we spent the day at<br/>
&gt; church, eating on our new dinner table (seats 12) &amp; swimming!<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, no letterboxing today...<br/>
