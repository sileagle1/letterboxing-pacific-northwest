she liked the polar bears and meercats. This visit everthing was <br/>
cool. My Monkey! My Bear! My Choo Choo! My Bats! My Water! My Lion! <br/>
(note: the signs at the zoo are wrong, the things labled as leopards <br/>
and tigers are really lions. Just ask Grace or her "boyfriend" Ryan)<br/>
<br/>
While there, we got to plant the Oregon Zoo Lorikeet Letterbox. Find <br/>
clues through the main site or here:<br/>

Visually figure out where the box is before trying to grab it. It <br/>
won't be too hard. Once you see where it is you can remove it with <br/>
your arm behind the bench without even looking at what you are doing. <br/>
Since the box is small, you can bring it out without anyone even <br/>
seeing.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Always take adequate precautions (such as prodding with a stick <br/>
and/or wearing gloves) before reaching into dark crevasses and holes <br/>
in the wild. <br/>
<br/>
...so, are we supposed to casually prod, stick in hand, arm behind <br/>
bench, whilst non-chalantly watching the critters, before trying to <br/>
remove it in the same fashion?  Do you have a webcam set up on this <br/>
box?<br/>
