Hi Raellyn and Melissa! Well I am finally coming to Euegene for a day <br/>
of letterboxing this thursday (short notice, I know) but if your <br/>
offer still stands and you are still willing to meet at a cafe or <br/>
somewhere and spend the day showing Sandi and I some local <br/>
letterboxes we would be greatful. Hopefully you will get this message <br/>
in time, since I couldnt find your email or name under the "members" <br/>
section. <br/>
   Or if there is anyone else in the Eugene area near I-5 willing to <br/>
letterbox with some out-of-towners please let me know soon. It is <br/>
hard to letterbox in an area we do not know at all in only one days <br/>
time and we would like to go somewhere we could find several to make <br/>
the trip worthwhile. Anyone up for a playdate if Raellyn doesnt <br/>
recieve this message in time?<br/>
