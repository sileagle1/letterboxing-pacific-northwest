Hey there Wild Woman,<br>
<br>
Well after reading Wild Woman's private email I do in fact thing that there<br>
is a high possibility that Puff the Magic Dragon is frolicing in the<br>
autimist somewhere else.  This is very sad news to me as Puff had to have<br>
been the best carving of the lot and one of my best works so far as far as<br>
caving here in Oregon.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Mary' Little Lamb has also been reported missing.  My reported<br>
missing boxes do seem to have a way of showing up again latter however, it<br>
has happened to me twice and most recently with one in California that even<br>
I went to check on and concluded missing and Princess Leigh found it durring<br>
her time there for the SLO Stamping Event.  That was quite something.  So<br>
perhaps Puff will follow the patter and show back up after a bit.<br>
<br>
My request however is that having just had surgery it is going to be a while<br>
before I am back on the trails again.  I am going to be trying to attend<br>
Fright Fest with Iron`Bear's help and with me mainly sitting still the whole<br>
time, but going on and checking on boxes is out of the stars for me right<br>
now.  Perhaps someone that has found these boxes and knows where they are<br>
located would be willing to go check on Puff and Mary's Lamb for me?  Don't<br>
mean to put you out on a limb Funhog but you are the only one I know that<br>
actually found all 12 stamps in the series.<br>
<br>
If not then I will of course try to get out there when I am feeling better.<br>
<br>
You all take care and find some good boxes for me!!!<br>
