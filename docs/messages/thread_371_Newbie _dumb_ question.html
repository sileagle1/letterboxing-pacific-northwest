<br/>
&gt; When it comes to placing boxes, do they "have" to be close by or can<br/>
&gt; they be left on trails with some hike involved?  (How far is too far?)<br/>
&gt; Also, could they be left in spots I can't necessarily get back to?<br/>
&gt; Like on trips or something?  With that in mind, how often to you<br/>

fewer visitors. Some folks, including me, really appreciate the more <br/>
remote boxes. Some folks, excluding me, even have time to hunt <br/>
them. :)<br/>
<br/>
Orphan boxes - those not near where you get back to regularly - are <br/>
fine. It is a good idea to note that it is an orphan in the clues so <br/>
folks can make an extra effort to bring replacement baggies just in <br/>
case repair needs to be done. Log books don't need a lot of pages to <br/>
last a while (at least in the PNW). A 50 page log book can last a <br/>
long time even for popular/easy to get boxes and would probably <br/>
suffice virtually forever in a remote box.<br/>

As for that box that requires a multi-day rafting trip to reach--it is possible to get it on a day hike from the nearest trailhead.  I did, and it's only about 24 miles (round trip).<br/>

I still don't know of any boxes that can't be done in a single day, though, if you're up for it.  =)<br/>
