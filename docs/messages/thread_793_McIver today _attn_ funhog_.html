Had to look for a couple more boxes in McIver today after a whippet <br/>
race meet.  I met up with Bookworm and we found a couple of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
First Times a Charm was a little bit un covered - all else was well <br/>
and we "re-covered better than we found".  <br/>
<br/>
The next box we found was Special Delivery.  Funhog - the log scroll <br/>
is full - we had just enough rom to stap in.  also the baggie was <br/>
torn.  I placed 2 blank 3x5 cards with the scroll in a new baggie <br/>
and re-hid. Hope that is ok - I didn't want to leave a box with no <br/>
place to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
More boxing tomorrow if enough time after racing.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
