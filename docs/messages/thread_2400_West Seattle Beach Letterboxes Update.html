I just took a walk along Beach Drive Southwest in West Seattle. I  <br/>
checked in on my letterboxes Constellation Park Marine Reserve,  <br/>
Cormorant Cove and Weatherwatch Park. All are ok. The winds and waves  <br/>
are pounding the beach. I estimate the winds at a steady 35 mph with  <br/>
gusts over 45 mph. It's raining buckets sideways.<br/>
<br/>
Constellation Park Marine Reserve letterbox is certainly under  <br/>
assault from the powers of mother nature. I was only able to visibly  <br/>
check that the letterbox is still above the waterline. Whew!<br/>
<br/>
All three letterboxes are going to be quite salty.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all are well where ever you live in the PNW.<br/>

I thought folks who have done the Beach drive boxes would appreciate<br/>
this photo taken by a co-worker.  Again, sorry for the attachment but<br/>
I thought it was worthwhile to share.<br/>

I don't allow attachments with messages on this board, so Yahoo Groups<br/>
automatically strips it off. Too much opportunity for spreading<br/>
viruses, as old-timers on the main letterboxing board already know. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
You'll either have to post the photo on your own website and provide a<br/>
link to it, or figure out your username and password to log in and<br/>
post it to the photos folder.<br/>
