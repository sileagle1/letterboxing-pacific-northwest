                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have had letterboxes in the Fraser Valley (B.C.) that have only been <br/>
visited twice in almost 2 years! It's definitely taking awhile to <br/>
catch on in this area. Fortunately, hunting for boxes is more <br/>
enjoyable for me than planting them. <br/>
<br/>
Zara and I will be going to Bellingham very soon as it is the nearest <br/>
place that I have been able to find the carving material I prefer. Of <br/>
course we plan on finding as many letterboxes as we can while we are <br/>
in the area. If we weren't on a schedule, we would choose to spend as <br/>
long as it took to find every letterbox... unfortunately, we only have <br/>
about 8 hours (including driving time).<br/>
<br/>
After reading your post, we immediately decided we must look <br/>
for "Raptors Everywhere!"; and then looked for the clue. Yikes! 4 <br/>
hours. The length of the hike is not a problem, but our lack of time <br/>
is. <br/>
<br/>
I would love to find your letterbox, and I hope I have the opportunity <br/>
to hunt for it some day. Too bad it's not in my neighbourhood!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The only reason a lot of my new boxes get visitors is because South Puget Sound is hungry for new ones.  After the regulars in the area stamp in, there's very few visitors.  I noticed some time ago that Bellingham's pretty skimpy on the Letterboxers, so I tried to do my part, but ended up moving and was only able to place a few in convenient places!  The Faery Tryst isn't THAT short of a hike...the map on the city parks site even lists some of the segments as being "difficult."  Tsk tsk, you and your high expectations...  ^_-<br/>
<br/>
My friend, "Vida," and I got in a lot of our Letterboxing by traveling to Canada and finding CSB and Zara's boxes, as well as others.  If you REALLY want to plant a tough box, you can steal the Easton Glacier hike, which I will probably never manage to do.  That's a few miles uphill.  But then that IS a National Park...  Still, you can plant tough ones, or get a lot of visitors.  Rarely will you get both!<br/>
<br/>
Would you happen to know the state of my Whatcom Falls box?  Last I knew it had been pulled apart and left in shambles, but a 'boxer put back together what was left of it.  Is there a new log book?  I can't get an update from anybody, and I can't get back there to check it out for myself!<br/>

a pretty quick response from people who like to be first.  Well, first<br/>
person to notify me that they had visited was a geocacher - fancy<br/>
that!  They didn't answer my inquiry as to whether they came across it<br/>
by accident or followed the clues, but I would like to know.  It has<br/>
clues that involve going into a facility that is not open 24/7, so I<br/>
suppose I may have to wait a while, but I was surprised at the lack of<br/>
visitors too - apparently something that is not uncommon at all.  Most<br/>
of my boxes are in remote locations where we camp, because I figure it<br/>
will give me a good excuse to go check on them frequently!  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, did you place a box in Manhattan called "Italian for Beginners"?<br/>
 The placer's name is VERY similar to yours.  If you did, I have a<br/>
funny story about it for you and will e-mail you off-group if you want<br/>
to hear it.<br/>

I thought I wrote you about this.  I did find this box, and placed a <br/>
few sheets of paper inside as a temp logbook.  The stamp and the box <br/>
itself were fine.<br/>
<br/>
And I did like the faery tryst boxes.  I wasn't bashing them.  I <br/>
just occassionally like to go on longer searches for boxes is all.  <br/>
That's actually why, when I found the faery tryst boxes, I rode my <br/>
bike to the park.  <br/>
