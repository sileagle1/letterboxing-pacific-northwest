Not sure why you claim there are no letterboxes in <br>
Mississippi, since I have one there and I know of<br>
several more.  Also don't know why you say there are<br>
no beaches.  Last I looked Mississippi is on the Gulf<br>
Of Mexico with warm sunny beaches.  I think you will<br>
like it once you get used to it.<br>
