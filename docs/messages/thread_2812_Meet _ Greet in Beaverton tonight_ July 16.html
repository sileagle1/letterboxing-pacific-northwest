<br/>
Lady B &amp; I are hosting a Meet &amp; Greet tonight, Monday, July 16, <br/>
starting at 6:30 pm.<br/>
<br/>
Place is Papa's Pizza, 15700 NW Blueridge Drive, Beaverton, OR 97006.<br/>
<br/>
Papa's Pizza has an indoor playland, complete with a little ferris <br/>
wheel, so little kids are more than welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Reservation is under "Audra Busey". <br/>
<br/>
Website is http://papaspizza.net/Beaverton.aspx.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you can't make it by 6:30, come when you can. We can <br/>
exchange, eat, get to know each other, and according to Lady B, the <br/>
kids will be happily playing for hours!<br/>
<br/>
Since I am posting this at the last minute, you can come without <br/>
having RSVP'ed. There is always room!<br/>
<br/>
If you need to contact me, my cell is 503-319-9006.<br/>
