Thanks!  We thought we found the right spot for #1, but didn't want to dig too deep either.  We knew we were missing something on #2, so we'll try again for that, we were actually out there until about 6:00 when we found #3.  I loved the #3rd stamp, very nice carving & subject.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Subject: Official Ferral Mc Whirter status of boxes<br>
<br>
I checked on my boxes today, after seeing discussion here this <br>
weekend.<br>
<br>
Box one is missing. The stump it was hidden in has disintigrated <br>
greatly since I last visited. Large chunks have fallen off. I have <br>
no doubt this is normal woodpecker and weather fall out. I did not <br>
dig in the very deep druff to look for the box, I might go back <br>
another time to do so.<br>
<br>
Box two and box three are alive and well exactly where planted. <br>
These clues are a bit of a challenge, so if you did not find, try <br>
again!<br>
<br>
