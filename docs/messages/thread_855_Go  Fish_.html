Didn't find the second box, but we were running out of light and decided to head to the 3rd box rather than search any more.  We found an unusual hitchhiker with this one!  There was a little hurt kitty sitting right by the "rounded rock three steps off the trail".  Out in the middle of nowhere, skinny as a stick, very hungry, and VERY friendly.<br>
<br>
Being the softies that we are, Sleepy Whippet and I stamped in with much help from Kitty, and after asking around & determining she'd been dumped (DON'T get me started) took her back with us.  No vets were open by that time, so Kitty came home to Vancouver with me and was left in a new "box" at St. Francis Vet Hospital.  <br>
<br>
You just never know what you'll find when letterboxing!  How do we count this one????<br>

P.S.  Kitty had a dislocated hip and will be fine after a little vet work.  She'll be going to a new home soon, I'm sure.<br>
