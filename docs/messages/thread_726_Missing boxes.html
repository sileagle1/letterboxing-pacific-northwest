was looking for that are missing.<br/>
<br/>
The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg in Beaverton is missing.<br/>
<br/>
Frog Park in Oregon City is missing.<br/>
<br/>
Found lots of boxes in Rood Bridge.  Nice park - easy trails, many <br/>
boxes for one trip - who could ask for more.  Sad to hear 2 have <br/>
gone missing there as well.  Too bad that is a collection and not a <br/>
series.  I hear the exact stamp won't be replaced if it is mising <br/>
but a diferent one may show up elsewhere in the park to keep the <br/>
number of boxes up.<br/>
<br/>
Added a bunch more stamps to my book in the last couple of days - <br/>
tired but satisfied!<br/>
