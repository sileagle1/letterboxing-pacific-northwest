"I could probably count on one hand all the boxes I've planted in the<br/>
states that haven't been found yet.  Even the most remote,<br/>
inaccessible crags where I've planted boxes have had someone brave <br/>
and daring enough to go after them.  "<br/>
*************************************************************<br/>
I was wondering if you were using "crag" as a figure of speach, or if <br/>
you have really planted some LB's in crags that can only be reached <br/>
by rockclimbers. I have never been fortunate to find an LB while out <br/>
climbing although Sandi did find one at the top of a cliff she had <br/>
just climbed and ironically they found the "love" HH inside of it and <br/>
then her (now husband) proposed to her and a beautiful ring magically <br/>
appeared :o) how sweet, and ironic that they found the Love HH <br/>
then :o) Anyways.. Ive never seen any listings for clues for these <br/>
kind of LBs so if they are out there, I would love to know where to <br/>
find the clues, such as a region # and state on LBNA, preferably on <br/>
the western side of the country :o) And dont worry, if I ever find <br/>
myself in Africa or Central America (which I do plan on someday <br/>
before little ones come along into my life) I will be sure to make a <br/>
special trip to find your letterboxes :o)<br/>

Hey, I planted a small 'love' HH in a film canister a while back. I <br/>
wonder if that one was ours--as it did start out in the Pacific <br/>
Northwest?  That would be sooooo cooool!!!  What a great story!!!  <br/>
You know if that HH is ours--I did a whole miniature series of <br/>
letterboxes as I was trying to use up my 'scraps' of carving medium--<br/>
I just couldn't bear to throw away the little bits of material and <br/>
had this idea that I could create some of the neatest things <br/>
in 'tiny' packages.  So, out of these scraps of carving medium, we <br/>
created the faith, hope and love hitchhikers.  Faith was a mustard <br/>
seed, hope was an anchor and love was a tiny heart within a heart.  <br/>
How cool that one of these tiny little hitchhikers could be tied to <br/>
such a neat story!!!<br/>

It's a figure of speech.  =)  I'm not aware of any letterboxes that<br/>
are accessible only by rock climbers, though that doesn't mean there<br/>
aren't any!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not much interested in rock climbing myself--I find myself getting<br/>
bored after being slapped up against the same rock for hours at a time<br/>
or standing at the bottom of the wall belaying someone.  Much too slow<br/>
paced for my style, so I won't be hiding any boxes that require rock<br/>
climbing skills.  I do have dreams of hiding a box a hundred or more<br/>
feet up in a tree that could require special equipment and training to<br/>
nab, though.  The catch there is that I don't have the special<br/>
equipment or training.  Once I do, though, you can expect some boxes<br/>
planted VERY high in the air!  =)<br/>

Funny.. I'm not much of a tree climber anymore :o) I was a <br/>
professional as a child :o) Well if you havent planted any boxes <br/>
in "crags" maybe I will have to think about doing it sometime. Might <br/>
be difficult to find a place that has anchors and such but isnt too <br/>
terribly popular for climbing so as not to be found accidently. <br/>
Anyways, thanks for the reply, it got my hopes up, but nope! haha :o)<br/>
