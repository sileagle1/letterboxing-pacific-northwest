AND with at least *some* trails that are easy enough for a recovering<br>
septigenarian to walk them in her climb back towards full health from a<br>
light stroke...  Something for everyone.<br>
<br>
They are SO worth the drive to get there!!!<br>

Camp at Silver Falls? At one of the most scenic<br>
parks in the state? No need to ask twice. I'm<br>
there! The weekend of the 9th sounds good<br>
to me, too.<br>
<br>
When I met with the staff at that park last year,<br>
they actually suggested that we hold an event<br>
there. The word was that there is an entire<br>
network of trails away from the waterfalls that<br>
are woefully underused. Their hopes were that<br>
the presence of letterboxes would get hikers<br>
into that part of the park, too.<br>
<br>
Trails that rarely get used, staff that welcomes<br>
our hobby, a part of the park unlikely to be<br>
inundated with visitors. Sounds like a win-win<br>
situation to me. Sign me up...<br>
