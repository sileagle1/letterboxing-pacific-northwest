<br>
We've been getting out to more and more letterboxes and noticing that our stamp is a bit large for some of the logbooks.  We have the word K-Nuts and then 4 nuts to represent the four of us in our family.  <br>
<br>
I've used an entire sheet trying to carve it smaller.  The nuts are unrecognizable.  I'm thinking of skipping the nuts; but I like them.  :)  Is there a trick?  <br>
<br>
I've watched the tutorial and I'm guessing that I just need practice; but if there's a short cut I bet one of you know it :)<br>

<br>
I would say the best thing to do is to practice, practice, practice. There are also many tools you can find that will help you to get the details that you want out of your siggy stamp such as carving material, carving tools, using a magnifying lamp, etc.<br>
<br>
Are you signed up for this event?:<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1560<br>
<br>
There will be a workshop on carving that may be helpful. You will have the chance to use some of the latest carving tools and equipment that many of letterboxers are using now to get the detail in their stamps. All of the workshops will be help on Saturday so if you come for the day, you will be able to attend them.<br>
<br>
Also, you can check out my profile page at AtlasQuest.com. I am now selling the tools and carving material if you are interested.<br>

You will undoubtedly come away a better carver than when you arrived; or at least you will have new techniques and possibly new tools to practice with.  You're right I think, it really does just take practice.<br>

<br>
Well, I found out about the event through SN Bone and about 2 weeks after we booked our Disneyland vacation.  I cannot believe they are on the same weekend.  I was tempted to try to move the Disneyland trip; but I can only move it to later and then Tristan will be back in school and I don't want him to miss school.  <br>
<br>
I bought more stuff today and am going to try again tonight.  I have a speedball carving tool with 5 different heads including a number 1.  I'm not sure that's the smallest; but it's the smallest I have.  <br>
<br>
I'll look up your profile!  I found a few of your stamps and love them :)  <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Thank you so much!  I really do want to figure it out.  I drew the picture I want for the stamp and am torn between asking someone to help make it just like I can draw it or knowing that I carved it myself flaws and all.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to try it a few more times and if I can't make an acceptable signature stamp small enough for log books :)  I will probably ask for help from a wonderful seasoned letterboxer!!  <br>

Thank you again!<br>

After 4.5 hours, I have an acceptable stamp. I had to cut off the peanut and glue a different one to it.  I don't know if all the nuts are recognizable; and it's not exactly like my drawing.  It's only 1" x 2" and so it should fit in almost any logbook.<br>
<br>
I can't attach it here; but I'm going to see if I can figure out how to add it to my AQ profile, if anyone wants to check it out. <br>
<br>
Thanks again for all the advice and I really wish we could come to the event this August!  Next time!<br>

Good job tackling your siggy stamp. I know it is always more special when you carve it yourself. I look forward to meeting you sometime and have fun at Disneyland!<br>

> > There will be a workshop on carving that may be helpful. You will have the chance to use some of the latest carving tools and equipment that many of letterboxers are using now to get the detail in their stamps. All of the workshops will be help on Saturday so if you come for the day, you will be able to attend them.<br>

<br>
I don't know if you can tell but I totally cut the top of the first peanut off, so instead of starting the stamp all over, I cut that section out and made the other one tiny and squeezed it into the same place and then glued it to a piece of wood.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure our family will be around and get to an event soon :)  How often are events held?  <br>
