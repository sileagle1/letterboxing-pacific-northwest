                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I just got my new Family Fun magazine and the darn thing opened right away to this heavy <br/>
stock page with pull up flaps all about the Chevy Suburban and it is called "Welcome to <br/>
Letterbox Camp". I'm all for advertising, but with our "leave no trace" ethic, wouldn't it be <br/>
better for us to be sponsored by some fuel efficient car than the gas guzzling Suburban????<br/>
<br/>
The back of the ad is all about letterboxing and even provides an image of the Suburban for <br/>
you to xerox and make into a stamp (ugg!)...at least they're encouraging people to make their <br/>
own stamps! It actually is pretty well done...Suburbans just bug me. <br/>
<br/>
I tried the familyfun link at the bottom (www.familyfun.com/letterboxcamp), but it doesn't <br/>
seem to work (yet?).<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd throw out my opinion and let those of you who don't get the magazine know <br/>
about the ad. <br/>
