                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few weeks ago I get word from Candlelight that my forth Elemental <br/>
letterbox (Water) is missing that that there is a geocache only a couple of <br/>
feet away.  It wasnt till yesterday that I got a chance to investigate.  <br/>
First I found the suspect geocache on the geocache website.  Sure nuff, <br/>
there were some vauge comments including this post from the cache owner....<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
I removed the letterbox from the cache (someone had taken EVERYTHING OUT OF <br/>
THE LETTERBOX AND PUT IN THE CACHE! WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!). I tried to <br/>
restore the letterbox, but of course someone has taken the rubber stamp from <br/>
the letterbox, so now no letterboxers can log the letterbox. Bad, bad, bad.<br/>
<br/>
I put the cache back in place. I put the letterbox back in place.<br/>
<br/>
I will hope that whoever took the rubber stamp from the letterbox will go <br/>
back and return it. If it isn't returned, I will contact the letterbox owner <br/>
and buy a replacement.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any more people who mess up the letterbox, I will archive this <br/>
cache.<br/>
<br/>
I think that would be sad but if geocachers can't resist the temptation to <br/>
spoil the letterbox I won't have any choice.<br/>
<br/>
Please, please, please exercise a little judgement and commonsense. I had <br/>
hoped that it would be fun to have a letterbox and a geocache share the same <br/>
space, and have that be a surprise. Alas, the number of people who have <br/>
posted logs which spoil the surprise is disappointing. The fact that <br/>
geocachers felt free to mess up the letterbox is very disappointing. If this <br/>
sounds like I am angry it is because I am.<br/>
<br/>
In comparison to the geocachers (who have stolen the stamp from the <br/>
letterbox, taken the entire contents of the letterbox and put them in the <br/>
cache, separated the letterbox note from the letterbox log book, and <br/>
generally been stupidly destructive) the letterboxers who have found the <br/>
cache apparently examined the contents, signed the log, and were careful to <br/>
replace the cache in its correct spot.<br/>
<br/>
I am very, very inclined to just archive the cache and write the whole thing <br/>
off to the fact that apparently it requires more sense than people generally <br/>
have.<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This pretty much wiped out any bad feelings I may have had over the issue.  <br/>
He didn't mean any harm, and thought two could co-exist peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
I shot off a friendly note to him, and went to check it out for myself.  <br/>
Sure 'nuff no sign of the letterbox and the geocache was there (nicely <br/>
hidden).  I took the time to sift thru the cache and read the log book.  <br/>
It's amazing the number of geocachers there are and so few knew about <br/>
letterboxing.  One person who had found the letterbox sounded confused and <br/>
suspected that it was part of "some stamping group".  Heh.<br/>
<br/>
I did a geocaching no-no and took something from the cache without leaving <br/>
anything behind....  But if you think about it, I did leave a whole <br/>
letterbox behind and mighty fine stamp too.  I took a water-tight plastic <br/>
thingy that might make a good mini letterbox.  So I call it even.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
When I got home, I already had a reply from the cache owner.  He was <br/>
extremely apologetic and felt very sorry that his geocache brought harm to <br/>
my letterbox.  He even offered to remove the cache entirely.<br/>
<br/>
So... if anyone wants the chance to see an honest to goodness geocache, go <br/>
check out my Redmond Elementals series.  You'll find the cache there, where <br/>
the last letterbox would be.  It's kinda cool, and there's even a log you <br/>
can stamp into if the mood strikes.<br/>
<br/>
I will be replacing the letterbox (away from the geocache), but due to my <br/>
personal schedule, and the time it will take to carve a replacement, it will <br/>
take a few weeks.<br/>

<br/>
I'm sure our LB/geocache experiences aren't the only ones out <br/>
there--this is probably happening all over the country. Personally, <br/>
I've had a few 'interactions' with geocache(r)s in our 11 months of <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I've had letterboxes near geocaches go missing quite <br/>
frequently. My first one that experienced this fate was the Ft <br/>
Nisqually letterbox--one of my first letterboxes I ever placed. I <br/>
should've realized that when a geocacher left a little toy in the <br/>
box a few weeks after we placed it--at the time, we just thought it <br/>
was a modified hitchhiker and we sent it on its way (wonder where <br/>
Jims GEMS are now?). Since then, I've had about 3 other letterboxes <br/>
near geocaches go missing. <br/>
<br/>
Now--when planting letterboxes (I often come across geocaches <br/>
when I'm looking for hiding spots--found about a dozen in that <br/>
manner so far) and I come across a geocache--I hide the letterbox as <br/>
far away from it as I possibly can (over 30' preferably). Inherent <br/>
GPS accuracy is not that great (for national security reasons) so <br/>
you can imagine a geocacher who is strictly following the gadget to <br/>
a given coordinate--when nearing his/her target they must just comb <br/>
the countryside to find the cache--often times, at its best the non-<br/>
military/navigational GPS can only come to within 30 feet accuracy--<br/>
from there, the geocacher must hunt and peck for the box (thus <br/>
revealing anything else they come across--typically letterboxes--in <br/>
the process). <br/>
<br/>
Now, when following trails I often can tell in an instant <br/>
where a geocache is--there is typically a blazed trail (damage to <br/>
the surrounding landscape) heading to the spot. I've also tried to <br/>
get a lot better about hiding my letterboxes in spots that don't <br/>
require off trail movement so as to avoid creating these 'off-trail' <br/>
dashes. I'm also trying to camouflage my boxes as well as possible <br/>
(hence the myriad black/brown containers I'm putting out these days) <br/>
to preclude these 'accidental' discoveries from occurring.<br/>
<br/>
I've met many geocachers in person (and virtually--I even spoke <br/>
with Jim whose GEMS we found last July) and they have often been <br/>
extremely nice people who share similar interests with <br/>
letterboxers. I've even met about a dozen geocachers on the trail <br/>
now, too (it's hard to miss their 'indicators' when they have a GPS <br/>
in one hand and a piece of printer paper in the other). I try to <br/>
tell them about letterboxing--if only to explain the hobby to them, <br/>
not necessarily to 'evangelize' letterboxing, so they protect any <br/>
letterboxes they stumble across in the future. I even accompanied <br/>
some of them to their geocachers and I observed little application <br/>
of/appreciation for the LNT ethic--that was enough to encourage me <br/>
to focus wholly on letterboxing (big comment coming from me because <br/>
I'm not a radical environmentalist by any definition of the word).<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, I come across geocaches while seeking letterboxes, <br/>
I typically will check in out of curiosity and try to repair it if <br/>
needed. I've also found a letterbox by hints supplied in a <br/>
geocache's log (Sunday in the Park with George series in Salem)--<br/>
never found box #2 and stumbled across the cache looking for #3. <br/>
The log had about 10 of 50 entries that discussed the nearby <br/>
letterbox. So, I figured it was still in the area. When I finally <br/>
found the letterbox, it was about 30 feet away from the cache! That <br/>
just solidified the built in inaccuracy of GPS's to me and how far <br/>
off course people get hunting for their treasures.<br/>
<br/>
It certainly was great to see this gentleman's comments about <br/>
protecting the neighboring letterbox. It was quite refreshing to <br/>
read! Thanks for sharing it with us--Mischief!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The geocache website can visually shows geocaches on a map so you <br/>
can look to see generally where they are. It's a pretty nifty <br/>
feature of the site. Also mapquest will map by coordinates. Note <br/>
that a lot of geocaches use the coordinates as a starting point and <br/>
then have clues like letterboxes. Some wind up being very far away <br/>
from the starting point which makes your life difficult if you are <br/>
trying to avoid planting near them. There are probably plenty of <br/>
geocaches you could find without ever needing a GPS. Without doing <br/>
much work probably the best you can determine is whether there is <br/>
already a geocache _likely_ in the park/area you are looking to hide <br/>
a box. Of course geocaches can show up nearby after you've hidden a <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: I've never found a geocache, this is just what I gather <br/>
from looking at the website for a while and looking at clues for <br/>
caches nearby. I know that a cache was placed near one of my boxes <br/>
after I planted it. So far without any problems that I'm aware of. <br/>
The geocache clues do mention my box and warn to make sure that <br/>
they've got the geocache and not the letterbox.<br/>

If anyone has boxed thru the park and transported the Mutton, I would <br/>
certainly appreciate hearing about it.<br/>

I agree. <br/>
<br/>
When I first discovered geocaching and was reading about it on the geocache web site, there was lots of talk of how the caches were this or that Tupperware or a bucket or something like that. I imagine someone in marketing just figured here was a niche to fill and started selling the stuff. <br/>

I meant to mention also that I don't geocache because I don't approve of the way some people do it... and I don't want to be lumped with the "slash and burn geocachers."  It is a shame that there are not more geocachers who Leave No Trace -- so many of them just follow their coordinates with no regard for the stuff they are trampling over. <br/>

Someone had to spend a lot of time and money to get that site running.  <br/>
Don't they deserve to profit from the time they've put into it?  <br/>

already a geocache _likely_ in the park/area you are looking to hide <br/>

box.<br/>

Disclaimer: I've never found a geocache, this is just what I gather <br/>
from looking at the website for a while and looking at clues for <br/>
caches nearby. I know that a cache was placed near one of my boxes <br/>
after I planted it. So far without any problems that I'm aware of. <br/>
The geocache clues do mention my box and warn to make sure that <br/>
they've got the geocache and not the letterbox.<br/>

thoughts on letterboxing &amp; <br/>
&gt; geocaching"...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm sure our LB/geocache experiences aren't the only ones out <br/>
&gt; there--this is probably happening all over the country. <br/>
Personally, <br/>
&gt; I've had a few 'interactions' with geocache(r)s in our 11 months <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've had letterboxes near geocaches go missing quite <br/>
&gt; frequently. My first one that experienced this fate was the Ft <br/>
&gt; Nisqually letterbox--one of my first letterboxes I ever placed. I <br/>
&gt; should've realized that when a geocacher left a little toy in the <br/>
&gt; box a few weeks after we placed it--at the time, we just thought <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; was a modified hitchhiker and we sent it on its way (wonder where <br/>
&gt; Jims GEMS are now?). Since then, I've had about 3 other <br/>
letterboxes <br/>
&gt; near geocaches go missing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now--when planting letterboxes (I often come across geocaches <br/>
&gt; when I'm looking for hiding spots--found about a dozen in that <br/>
&gt; manner so far) and I come across a geocache--I hide the letterbox <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; far away from it as I possibly can (over 30' preferably). Inherent <br/>
&gt; GPS accuracy is not that great (for national security reasons) so <br/>
&gt; you can imagine a geocacher who is strictly following the gadget <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; a given coordinate--when nearing his/her target they must just <br/>
comb <br/>
&gt; the countryside to find the cache--often times, at its best the <br/>
non-<br/>
&gt; military/navigational GPS can only come to within 30 feet accuracy-<br/>
-<br/>
&gt; from there, the geocacher must hunt and peck for the box (thus <br/>
&gt; revealing anything else they come across--typically letterboxes--<br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the process). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, when following trails I often can tell in an instant <br/>
&gt; where a geocache is--there is typically a blazed trail (damage to <br/>
&gt; the surrounding landscape) heading to the spot. I've also tried to <br/>
&gt; get a lot better about hiding my letterboxes in spots that don't <br/>
&gt; require off trail movement so as to avoid creating these 'off-<br/>
trail' <br/>
&gt; dashes. I'm also trying to camouflage my boxes as well as possible <br/>
&gt; (hence the myriad black/brown containers I'm putting out these <br/>
days) <br/>
&gt; to preclude these 'accidental' discoveries from occurring.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've met many geocachers in person (and virtually--I even spoke <br/>
&gt; with Jim whose GEMS we found last July) and they have often been <br/>
&gt; extremely nice people who share similar interests with <br/>
&gt; letterboxers. I've even met about a dozen geocachers on the trail <br/>
&gt; now, too (it's hard to miss their 'indicators' when they have a <br/>
GPS <br/>
&gt; in one hand and a piece of printer paper in the other). I try to <br/>
&gt; tell them about letterboxing--if only to explain the hobby to <br/>
them, <br/>
&gt; not necessarily to 'evangelize' letterboxing, so they protect any <br/>
&gt; letterboxes they stumble across in the future. I even accompanied <br/>
&gt; some of them to their geocachers and I observed little application <br/>
&gt; of/appreciation for the LNT ethic--that was enough to encourage me <br/>
&gt; to focus wholly on letterboxing (big comment coming from me <br/>
because <br/>
&gt; I'm not a radical environmentalist by any definition of the word).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Occasionally, I come across geocaches while seeking letterboxes, <br/>
&gt; I typically will check in out of curiosity and try to repair it if <br/>
&gt; needed. I've also found a letterbox by hints supplied in a <br/>
&gt; geocache's log (Sunday in the Park with George series in Salem)--<br/>
&gt; never found box #2 and stumbled across the cache looking for #3. <br/>
&gt; The log had about 10 of 50 entries that discussed the nearby <br/>
&gt; letterbox. So, I figured it was still in the area. When I finally <br/>
&gt; found the letterbox, it was about 30 feet away from the cache! <br/>
That <br/>
&gt; just solidified the built in inaccuracy of GPS's to me and how far <br/>
&gt; off course people get hunting for their treasures.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It certainly was great to see this gentleman's comments about <br/>
&gt; protecting the neighboring letterbox. It was quite refreshing to <br/>
&gt; read! Thanks for sharing it with us--Mischief!!!<br/>

Everyone is probably aware that I am a big anti-geocache person. Poor <br/>
Lea is living down in the SFO area and just ran out of letterboxes to <br/>
go after and she tried this geocaching thing. Of course the thing she <br/>
takes out of the box is the "travel bug"! The geocachers get a little <br/>
miffed with her, because someone else went to that cache specifically <br/>
looking for the bug to move it on and it was gone. Lea had <br/>
not "logged" it into the geocache website fast enough. --actually she <br/>
wasn't aware of the etiquette until she went to comment on her find <br/>
and found the comments about the  "idiot who took the bug and didn't <br/>
log it in" They yelled at her a little bit, but anyway...the point of <br/>
the story is that we had to go to a geocache to return this travel <br/>
bug. <br/>
<br/>
We went to Padden Puppy Trove in Bellingham, WA which is a <br/>
letterbox/geocache hybrid.  In the logbook (a slick waterproof paper <br/>
book put out especially for geocaching) for the geocache portion of <br/>
this box, they consistently complained about how far off the GPS <br/>
coordinates were. Most reverted to the letterbox clues to find the <br/>
thing. It was a honking big ammo box with a slick Geocache sticker on <br/>
the side. The whole commercial/corporate sponsership of the thing <br/>
makes my skin crawl. How expensive must it be for these folks to buy <br/>
the waterproof books and the stickers and these ammo boxes and then <br/>
all the little toys and dodads???!!! I have been over to the <br/>
geocaching site and it is very slick and high tech. AND meant to sell <br/>
GPS's and the assorted paraphernalia. I can see how it can suck in <br/>
people. Especially guys (no offense) who like that sort of high tech <br/>
gadgetry. And little kids who like little crappy dollar store toys. <br/>
(again no offense)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">But we walk away from a site with exactly what we walked in with, most of the time the boxes are small enough to not "need" any alterations in the landscape and are "hidden" in natural hiding spots.  And we are by nature, somewhat materialistic, and patches and medalions are but small tokens of accomplishment.    While at Oxbow last weekend, I came across an empty florescent orange bucket on the Ancient Forest Trail.  It was buried up to the lid just off the trail.  I cannot imagine the Forest Service placing it there.  <br/>

Someone had to spend a lot of time and money to get that site running.  <br/>
Don't they deserve to profit from the time they've put into it?  <br/>

We sell stuff, though Mohmers probably doesn't make a living from it!<br/>
Does that mean we've sold out too?<br/>
