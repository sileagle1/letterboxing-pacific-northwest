boxes. Thank you to all the placers for another fun set of boxes.<br>
<br>
Yaquina Head Lighthouse - Beautiful view and well visited box. I saw stamps<br>
in the book from 12 different states. That was to much fun for words.<br>
<br>
What's For Dinner - Box 2 log is almost full, box 3 log is full. Very cute<br>
series. I'm dying to know what the missing box 4 was.<br>
<br>
Anna's Hummingbirds - Very cute series, nice location. Slight mix up in<br>
directions but I already talked to Pandora and she was getting right on<br>
fixing those!<br>
<br>
Care Bear Stare - Wonderful series for kids... both of mine were tickled<br>
pink.<br>
<br>
I'd Lasso It For You - Fun box, cute stamp, great drive by!<br>
<br>
And I do believe that's it for now.<br>
<br>
I also hid a box, "Can't See The Forest For The Trees". Clues to come today.<br>
It has the first of my new special firsties in it, I hope whomever picks it<br>
up will let me know what they think of it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yup yup I already fixed the directions - got my left and right wrong a<br>
couple times on that last box and I apologize to anyone that might have<br>
missed it because of that. I got an email from Charlie telling me how many<br>
were in each log book when he went and it seems someone missed box 4 - I<br>
apologize. The clues are fixed now and hopefully you can grab it again no<br>
problem.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Just so everyone knows I got the What's For Dinner series when I panted the<br>
Anna's Hummingbirds and I am positive box 4 in that series is not missing<br>
:-) But I won't tell what it is either.  I know Funhog recently replanted<br>
this box and I am not sure if she adjusted the clues to show it had been<br>
replaced or not.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I'm glad the kids are enjoying care bare stare that is what it is there for!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now I guess I gotta go see if I can get lost in the forest finding Maiden's<br>
new box.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Happy Hunting!<br>
