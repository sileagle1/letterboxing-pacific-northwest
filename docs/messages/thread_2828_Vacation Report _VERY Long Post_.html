                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those that dislike long posts listing of "Found" letterboxes <br>
please jump over this one. Gwen may go back and send individual notes <br>
to the placers, but here is a post that covers most of our finds. Now <br>
should you choose to jump over this post then of course you should <br>
realize you will miss the story of Sahallie Falls.<br>
<br>
*Don't Know Jack, nice carving and great location.<br>
*Dee Wright Observatory, we got both boxes, and it was interesting <br>
that each box had different finders stamping in.<br>
*Gazing the Night Sky, quite a collection of stamps and interesting <br>
location.<br>
*All Girls are Princesses.<br>
*Calliope Crossing, Early Birder plant.<br>
*Gooblers Knob, The dogs and Gwen stayed on top while I did the <br>
climbing down.Yikes!<br>
*Sweet Fragrance& A River Hood, both quick nice finds<br>
*Fruit Loop Series, Lost Lake Series were shared with a brand new <br>
letterboxer that lives in Hood River.<br>
*Trillium Series, early Wingnut<br>
*Pioneer Conestoga, Mark & Sue plant<br>
*Cloud Cap Inn, I talked with some of the volunteer recovery searchers<br>
*Columbia River Gorge Wine Tour, and WOW!!!!! the bonus stamp at <br>
Cathedral Winery. That stamp is the most inticate carving we have <br>
ever seen. Double Tree blew us away.<br>
*Cheyennes Summer Vacation.<br>
*Hood River Marina series, We were but a few hours behind Double Tree <br>
and were with Kuriou Jo and Wood Aug<br>
*Spidey and Gentle Touch was shared with a new letterboxer<br>
*The HOG'S Hurricane Llamas...Oh that trail?<br>
*Rest Day, alive and well.<br>
*Fish Kiss, some of Pirates of the Carribian<br>
*Wood Aug's Elk, Gwen took the ride, Don watched the dogs.<br>
*Jr. Asparagus and Larry the Cucumber<br>
*Eagle Lake<br>
Of course we left a few in our wake, so anyone finding that our boxes <br>
need some work please help us out.<br>
<br>
We didn't print out clues to some of the places we went and this <br>
could be the case of Sahallie Falls. We saw this sign for Sahalie <br>
Falls,and took the turn off for about a mile to an old bridge and a <br>
beautiful falls. I had carved the stamp (see Endangered Bull Trout LB)<br>
that I was just itching to plant. While Gwen was checking out the <br>
bridge and falls I went looking for a likely hiding spot. I found <br>
this long log next to the road running parallel to the road and went <br>
down to the far end. I went around to the down hill side at the far <br>
end and started poking around under the log. I figured that this <br>
would be easy to identify for clues. All of a sudden my feet slipped <br>
out from under me and I went down on my left hand and ended up on my <br>
butt. I sat there for a while kind of taking inventory of any <br>
damages. <br>
I startered to get up, looked at my left hand that was covered in <br>
something and realized with the accompanied smell that I landed in  <br>
crap. Now I've been in my share of doodoo in my life so I quickly <br>
understood that this wasn't dog doodoo or bear doodoo but stinky <br>
human doodoo. YUK! Oh well it was just a bit on my left hand and a <br>
small bit on my pants left side, I can handle that. I got up got out <br>
some water containers and was able to wash the stuff off. Gwen <br>
maintaining her composure and not giggling turned to me and asked" Do <br>
you have any extra pants in the truck?" Knowing that I had completely <br>
washed everything off asked why as I was getting some shorts out of <br>
the truck. She just said don't bother to ask, just change, but leave <br>
the pants in the back of the truck. It seems I hit the pile of doodoo <br>
smack dab in the middle of my butt.<br>
<br>
There is no Don & Gwen letterbox at Sahallie Falls as I didn't want <br>
to leave the previously carved stamp there and didn't want to carve a <br>
new one. Had I left one you know what the carving would have looked <br>
like and we all have seen enough crap in our lives.<br>
<br>
Next time I see a prone log I'm not going on the downhill side to <br>
poke around.<br>
<br>
All in all, we had a great time in the PNW finding all of the boxes, <br>
spending time fishing and Kayaking on your beautiful lakes and rivers.<br>
Thanks for planting!<br>

If you know how to find LbNA then merely go to the map of Oregon, <br>
specifically N central Oregon and pull up the list.<br>
