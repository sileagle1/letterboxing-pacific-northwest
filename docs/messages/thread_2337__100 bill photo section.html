Edit, ... may help you delete photos?  Looks like I need to do the same <br/>
with some photos there.  I noticed, though, that some of the photos I <br/>
posted there allow the better resolution and others don't.  Funny, <br/>
they're all taken with the same camera and most likely the same <br/>
settings as I rarely mess with them on the camera I use most often!<br/>
