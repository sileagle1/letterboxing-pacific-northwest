Hi, Just as a heads up to those in Southern heaven, oops I mean <br>
Oregon, :o) There are 3 more LB's hiding, one in Rogue River, Hugo, <br>
And near Canyonville. These won't be listed in our "Region (#6)" on <br>
the LBNA site because the placer didnt put the county. You can find <br>
them in the "whats new" section. The county is under "Dunno" and <br>
after reading the persons website I dont think they knew the county <br>
so I dont think I am blowing any secrets here (which I can be <br>
unfortuantly good at doing). And since they are not listed under <br>
Mystery boxes I figured we should get them while we can, while they <br>
are still under the "whats new" section after that, I dont know where <br>
they will be listed at so if you want these boxes you might need to <br>
act fast, or at least copy down the directions while still find-<br>
able. :o)<br>

site or looking her up as placer. And I'm sure if you emailed her and let<br>
her know you happen to know the counties she would be happy to change them.<br>
I know she planted these while on a road trip and had no idea what counties<br>
those were in. Drop her an email, it works wonders.<br>
