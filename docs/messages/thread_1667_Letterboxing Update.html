Wow! What a weekend. I started out on Saturday going after Funhog's<br/>
latest Central Oregon offering, Winged Wonders. The<br/>
letterboxes were not the only wonders. If you want a great<br/>
hike and want to see some spetacular canyons this is for you.<br/>
Then Sunday The lennen's 3 and I went after Sawyer Park Series,<br/>
Juniper Park series (both planted by Birder), Pilot Butte and even<br/>
picked up  DoDobird HH started by Maiden1974.<br/>
It was my 40th Birthday on Saturday and my sis of Lennen's 3 <br/>
planted  a box to celebrate. Clues will be posted soon for all to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks go to Funhog, Birder,The Lennen's 3 and Miaden1974.<br/>
Thanks for a wonderful weekend!<br/>
