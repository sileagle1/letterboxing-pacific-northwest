dignified than 'Ryan'.  Any suggestions?  Perhaps King Ryan?  Or, no, <br>
how about Emperor Ryan?  Yes, that has a nice ring to it....  ;o)<br>
<br>
Just kidding....  I feel like I'm a kid in a playground looking <br>
around at all the interesting 'features' that I've never been able to <br>
see before because I've only been a lowly peon on the Yahoo Groups <br>
until now, though.  =)<br>
<br>
In other news, I'm working on creating the world's largest AND the <br>
world's smallest letterboxes.  It might be awhile before those come <br>
out, but they are in the works.  The world's smallest will make a <br>
film cannister look huge in comparison, while the world's largest--<br>
let's just say that if you bring a regular notebook-sized 8 1/2 x 11 <br>
piece of paper to log the find, you might find the stamp a little too <br>
large to fit.  I'll probably have to provide some LARGE pieces of <br>
paper in the letterbox for people to use to stamp their find.<br>
<br>
The two boxes would have to be connected in some way--the <br>
juxtiposition is too great to hide them separately.  Hey--I just had <br>
a thought--the world's largest letterbox really is going to be <br>
LARGE.  In fact, maybe it would be SO large I could hide the world's <br>
smallest letterbox IN the world's largest.  What a hoot that would <br>
be.  I'd have to find some clever mechanism to hide the world's <br>
smallest letterbox in the world's largest where unless someone was <br>
actually looking for the world's smallest, they'd miss it.<br>
<br>
Ooohh....  Okay, now I'm really getting excited about this project.  <br>
What a challenge!  There are bonus boxes, hitchhikers, cuckoo boxes, <br>
and probably a dozen other varieties where a clue or letterbox is <br>
hidden in another letterbox, but not really HIDDEN in it, know what I <br>
mean?  I've got to think this over some more.  Any suggestions would <br>
be greatly appreciated, though!  =)<br>
