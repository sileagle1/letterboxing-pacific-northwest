I had to go the long way around, though, to actually GET to that spot, so I went as quickly as I could, but the person was gone by the time I got there!  I was so excited that I'd actually HAD my letterboxing stuff with me and would be able to exchange with this person randomly, especially if they were a newbie...<br/>
<br/>
  So, whoever you were, if you're reading this, it pays to lag and linger at times!!  haha...<br/>
