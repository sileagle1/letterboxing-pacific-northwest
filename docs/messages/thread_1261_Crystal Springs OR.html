box there. The gardens are beginning to do their amazing springtime extravaganza, a <br>
sight to behold! My little box is still in it's little hidey hole awaiting its next visitor. <br>
(Melanie, could that be you?) All of my southeast Portland boxes are still in action. <br>
The one at Bishop's Close is still in need of a new log but the stamp is in its rightful <br>
place. Funhog<br>
