I had company in town yesterday and I convinced them to try <br>
letterboxing with me. We started off and found the #2 Duck of Duck, <br>
Duck, Goose. We continued and found the Goose. Since we had started <br>
off in the middle of the hunt, we returned to my car. My visitors <br>
decided that they would rather go to the mall to do some after-<br>
Christmas shopping than backtrack to the First Duck :-(<br>
<br>
So I can only report on part of this series. It is another quality <br>
job by Green Guillemot.<br>

PS: I also had a report that the Kubota box is alive and well! That <br>
always amazes me. I figured that one would be missing within the <br>
first 6 months after I planted it.<br>
