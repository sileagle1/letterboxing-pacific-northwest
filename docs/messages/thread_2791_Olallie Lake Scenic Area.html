Oh, this all takes me down memory lane. My hubby and I, along with<br>
another couple and their Irish wolfhound would camp at the cabins at<br>
Olallie Lake over Memorial Day weekend.<br>
<br>
This was always a backpacking trip on snowshoes. And it was always a<br>
bit of a crap-shoot because we never knew just how far we would need <br>
to hike. It all depended on where the snow made the roads impassable.<br>
When we hit the snow we would just pull over, gear up and start <br>
hiking. Sometimes it was three miles and sometimes it was ten. And<br>
the dog would always step on my hubby's snowshoe, and down Tom would <br>
go with his full pack. It happened so often that we couldn't help but<br>
laugh.<br>
<br>
The area was closed to the public, we had the keys to the cabin and <br>
the entire place to ourselves. Beauty!<br>

Only, I'm pretty sure the yurts close down around Sept 20.  I know <br>
they disassemble them for the winter.  I personally recommend yurt 2 <br>
or 5 as they have better interiors and more space, but yurt 13 has <br>
the best view of Mt. Jefferson.  It's right outside the door, <br>
overlooking the lake.  Can't beat it.<br>
<br>
There is also regular camping at several campgrounds, all of which <br>
are also described on the website. <br>

quality problems at a couple of other Cascade Lakes and the county<br>
decided to shut down the water at Olallie too even though their weekly<br>
water quality tests showed nothing wrong. The folks who run the place<br>
supply water safe for drinking and another container for washing. You<br>
get a fresh supply everyday. The wash water is the same water that<br>
everyone there has been drinking for years. <br>
<br>
The lack of shower is annoying, especially for those PCT thru-hikers<br>
who have been looking forward to a warm bath. We have a solar shower<br>
that works great for camping. As long as the sun is out and you shower<br>
in the evening when the water is still warm, it's a great thing to<br>
have. Don't let the water situation stop you from visiting one of our<br>
most wonderful spots. Funhog<br>
