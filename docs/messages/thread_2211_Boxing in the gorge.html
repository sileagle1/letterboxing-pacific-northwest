Sun. either weekend - my main objective is the Outdoors Series #3 and<br>
#4, but I know there are a lot of them out there and I would want to<br>
get some more while in that area.  I'm not a spring chicken but not<br>
ancient either - I don't go fast and I think I can do 4 miles max. <br>
Anyone interested in joining me please get in touch. I'm trying to<br>
meet local boxers a few at a time.<br>
