The sagebrush beckoned this holiday weekend. This morning,<br>
Birder and I hit the road in search of the perfect spot for our <br>
first collaboration. We left two new letterboxes lurking in the <br>
desert in a wonderful remote location. Hopefully, this will only<br>
be the first of our joint ventures. Mountain bluebirds flashed<br>
their lovely colors for us, a good omen for sure. <br>
<br>
Being a long weekend, I got to spend time three days in a row<br>
tending to letterboxing pleasures in Central OR. I tracked down<br>
the latest offering from the Fleshmans and hid another box at <br>
Smith Rock on Saturday. While checking on my Mariposa<br>
Lily box there I found that it has had only two groups of <br>
letterboxers come for a visit in over two years. C'mon over <br>
the mountains... the skies are brilliant blue, the scenery <br>
spectacular and the letterboxes abound. Funhog<br>

We recently went to Paradise Lodge (Agness, OR) for our precious <br>
treasures and discovered only 3 groups of Letterboxers had stamped it <br>
in 2 years! So its kind of like the one Funhog mentioned. It is <br>
really kind of sad too because as far as LBing goes, getting the <br>
paradise lodge LB was some of the best fun I have had and by far some <br>
of the most beautiful landscape, unbelievably gorgeous! I am <br>
dissapointed so few have attempted this trek. Unfortunately for some <br>
(and good for others) the only way to reach this place is by private <br>
plane (yeah like we all got those), jet boat, or 24 (total) mile <br>
hike. Well, we cheated. We only had to hike maybe a total of 6 (easy) <br>
miles. So I sent the directions to the placer for the shortcut and so <br>
maybe now they will see more LB'ers out there. It is soooo worth it! <br>
Just beware of cowpies...free range cattle roam quite happily out <br>
there (until our dogs took chase, mine had never seen a cow before, i <br>
think he was in heaven). Oh and watch out for bears :o)<br>

Whaaat?!  You mean I killed myself by hiking out 24 miles and there<br>
was an easy 6-mile shortcut available?!  *gasp*  The blisters on my<br>
feet had me limping for a week and didn't fully heal for a couple of<br>
months!<br>
<br>
And the whole time there was a 6-mile shortcut?  *sniffle*  Don and<br>
Gwen, why did you do this to me?!  Why??!!  =)<br>

Well Ryan we are just mean to the core. Until E from Grants Pass let <br>
us know about the short cut, we weren't aware of it either. Our <br>
plans are to add letterboxes to the river coridor on our next trip <br>
on the Rogue so a short cut probably won't help that much anyway.I <br>
did write a note on the clue sheet for those that are looking for <br>
Paradise. The best way to nab these two letterboxes is via raft.<br>
