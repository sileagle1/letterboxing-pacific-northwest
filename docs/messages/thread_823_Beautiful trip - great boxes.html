Monster with me and hit up the Trilium Lake Forest Friends Series.  <br/>
Thankfully we took a wrong turn and found Box #3 on the ground <br/>
behind this giant tree with the lid bearing rodent dentura marks :) <br/>
After we stamped in we rehid in the original spot which we found <br/>
without problems.  What a beautiful place!  Mount Hood was glorious <br/>
as only she can be!  Heard several different languages being spoken <br/>
as we circled the lake, Japanese, German, Russian &amp; Spanish.  <br/>
Interesting people about!  <br/>
<br/>
Stopped into the Crater Lake box, lots of people coming from the <br/>
lake as we walked in so no one to bother us while looking for the <br/>
box.  It looked like someone/thing lunched on another thing bearing <br/>
lots of bright blue feathers right on top of the spot where the box <br/>
was hidden, nothing yukkie there *whew* just feathers.  We replaced <br/>
exactly like we found without incident.<br/>
<br/>
Camp Creek Campground was closed so we parked off of the main road <br/>
and walked in to find the box - clever hiding spot!  since it was <br/>
close to dark I am glad that mini-maglight found it's way into my <br/>
LB'ing stuff.  Awesome stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Stopped at Calamity Jane's for giant burgers on the way home.  For <br/>
those of you who haven't had the pleasure of a Calamity Jane meal <br/>
they have about 50 different kinds of hamburgers.  Yummy!<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful day and great fun!  <br/>
<br/>
Now on to Fright Fest this next weekend!<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
