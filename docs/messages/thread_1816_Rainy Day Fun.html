Just got home from the perfect wet weather <br/>
letterbox! We headed out to find Jay's Toolbox <br/>
and I have to say that this is one of the most <br/>
clever letterboxes I have found. We took the <br/>
entire box back to our car and stamped in <br/>
while keeping everything perfectly dry. With <br/>
all the goodies that have been added to this <br/>
box, the process is pretty time-consuming <br/>
but the collection created by so many carvers <br/>
is a treasure. If you haven't found this one<br/>
yet, you're in for a treat! Funhog<br/>
