great way to insure they will remain intact for years to come.<br/>

<br/>
All is well (if the stamp is broken and the log book almost <br/>
completely full) -- it's a crazy climb -- and took an hour an half <br/>
for 2 out of shape climbers to get up the 1.6 miles -- but it was <br/>
worth it.  BEAUTIFUL view at the top -- and always a nice breeze --- <br/>
or so I'm told...  Heck, it took 45 minutes to get down the freakin' <br/>
mountain...<br/>
<br/>
Of course, once at the top -- I noticed a 9.7 mile hike to the "Old <br/>
Snohomish Winery" -- where they suggest you park a car at *both* <br/>
ends of the hike -- suggesting to me it's not the kind of hike you'd <br/>
like to do 2x in one day...<br/>
<br/>
But now...  I'm thinking of a few letterboxes along *that* hike -- <br/>
start up Rattlesnake Ledge early in the day if I actually pull this <br/>
off -- it's a 10 mile hike following :).<br/>
