<br>
Unfortunately, I'm not going to make it to the South Sound LB Fest this <br>
weekend.  Because I'll be to BUSY getting ready for my trip to MONTANA!!  Woohoo!  <br>
There appears to be only one letterbox already planted in the area <br>
(Ronan/Apgar/Kalispell).  So, I am hoping to plant a few myself, which means I will have <br>
to plan ahead and have some boxes made up in advance . . .   I just know I <br>
can't take an exacto knife on the plane!  Anyone familiar with the area?<br>

In the spirit of sharing a moment, let me say:  I've just put myself on "no <br>
mail" for the LbNA list -- I can go to the Yahoo LbNA group site if I want to <br>
read posts.  I feel better now.  <br>
