The main reason I kept the board private is to make it more difficult<br>
for spiders to troll the site.  Google can't google the pages to list<br>
them.  Spammers can't look for e-mail addresses like somebody@y...<br>
(which we all know is short for somebody@yahoo.com) and such.<br>
<br>
If someone really wants to read the messages here, though, there's<br>
nothing to stop it.  Anybody can sign up and be able to read the<br>
boards--there are no restrictions on that.  The first post or two<br>
requires moderator approval, but no approval is necessary to actually<br>
read posts, so if you're inclined to say something that you'd rather<br>
not have some people hear, it's probably not a good idea to be posting<br>
it here in the first place.<br>
<br>
So, so far, two votes for not making the board public and one vote for<br>
allowing the RSS feeds (by making the board readable by non-members).<br>

Since this is a members only mailing list, then it should be avaialble to<br>
the memebrs only and not to the public in any way. If it is open to the<br>
public, then make it open to the public all the way.<br>
<br>
Leave it as it is.<br>

I tend to wholeheartedly agree,<br>
keep it the way it is.<br>
it is pretty scary when I have done google searches for other topics<br>
and the names, emails and connections that are so freely given!!!<br>
wouldnt want that at all.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My first instinct was to allow the RSS feed.  Why not?  I believe in making things easier for everyone.<br>
 <br>
Then I read that this setting would affect our privacy settings. Now I'm more strongly in favor of the idea than ever before!<br>
 <br>
Lately, I have not been receiving nearly enough special offers from sites that are willing to sell me Celexa or Viagra without a prescription... and I'm always looking for new online gambling sites!<br>
 <br>
Besides that, I have managed to misplace the email address of that person who said I could become rich if I helped to transfer millions of dollars from a third-world country to an American bank account... and I'm pretty sure that I need to confirm my Paypal password again.<br>
 <br>
So, please, by all means, open this list up to the general public.  Can we also send digests randomly to people who are not subscribed?<br>

It sounds like a couple of you might have mis-understand what I said<br>
about the RSS feed.  The first post people make would still be<br>
moderated to elimite spam from cluttering up the lists--the only<br>
difference is that people could now read posts without actually having<br>
to sign up for the list.  They still wouldn't be able to post without<br>
signing up and making it through the moderating process.<br>
<br>
E-mail addresses are "hidden" in either case, though it's often easy<br>
to figure it out.  <br>
<br>
I'm kind of inclined to allow the RSS feeds myself because, like you,<br>
I like to make things easier for people and realistically, it's<br>
unlikely to cause spam and other horrible things to happen.  This talk<br>
list IS public and open to everyone for reading as it is--there's just<br>
an extra step people have to go through (i.e. officially signing<br>
up)--to get at it.<br>
<br>
But it sounds like the overwhelming majority would prefer to keep<br>
things as is, and that's okay with me too. =)<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for clarifying that, Ryan.  I'm glad to learn that the scenarios presented in my tounge-in-cheek post are not going to become a reality regardless of whether or not we allow the RSS feeds.<br>
 <br>
So, in that case, all sarcasm aside, I actually would support the change to allow RSS feeds. As you have pointed out, anyone can read these posts either way, if they want to.  Having to sign up is not all that big of an obstacle... especially for people who are already members of other Yahoo groups.<br>
 <br>
But that's just my humble opinion... I'm happy to let the majority rule.<br>
