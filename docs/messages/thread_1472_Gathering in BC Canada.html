<br/>
Right now the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend looks like a good bet. So the<br/>
gathering would be on Sat Oct 9th.<br/>
This is also a huge weekend for Historic Fort Langley with the annual<br/>
Cranberry Festival, so lots to see and do as well as hunting for<br/>
letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Please reply directly to our e-mail if you will be attending and any other<br/>
information you might need ( a list of accommodations, there is also a camp<br/>
site near by ) and we will start the preparations for a wonderful day of<br/>
Letterboxing, history, food and great Old Canadian Fun!! <br/>
<br/>
As we get closer to the date, we would want to confirm attendance, as we<br/>
would need a good number to make the event a "go".<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, happy hunting, walk softly and be safe!<br/>

We're totally up for a gathering in BC in the Fall!  In fact, we  <br/>
finally got passports for everybody!!!  We'll be off the continent <br/>
from mid-Sept until the end of October so anytime before or <br/>
thereafter would work for us.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you Camp Fire Lady and Cat's Meow --<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you guys made it up there - I have to agree with you that the Trail<br/>
Where They Cried is quite the treacherous trail; I think we had Ryan and<br/>
Funhog in mind when we planted that series - we wanted to give them<br/>
something a little harder than our normal boxes to do.  I think the other<br/>
influence was that I have to agree with you - the stamp images for the Trail<br/>
where they cried is by far the best carving I have ever done and really<br/>
shows Iron Bear's artistic ability - we had found a few Indian images that<br/>
were what he was looking for - but when he freehand drew them and altered<br/>
them to fit his location I was amazed at what wonderful stamp images they<br/>
made.  Also, the letterboxes where planed before we got there, it was an<br/>
area Iron`Bear had been to before and had some very special experiences at,<br/>
at each stamp was very specifically drawn to where it was located.  So when<br/>
we discovered that there had been a fire there, we decided to plant them<br/>
anyway, I think the name of the series is very fitting to the trail and the<br/>
story involved in the letterbox is something we can all learn a little bit<br/>
of Native American history from.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm so happy you were able to get the images, and I totally agree Cat's Meow<br/>
deserves a pat on the back - Iron`Bear and I would not have taken Sim Kitty<br/>
on that trial, so I think Cat's Meow did magnificent.<br/>
<br/>
And having seen you both when you stopped by after your hiking and can<br/>
honestly say it was the first time you looked more tired than she did!<br/>
Hehehe<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for all the complements,<br/>
Pandora{I`B} (I'm sure Iron`Bear would agree, but he's still sleeping)<br/>

<br/>
Last Saturday, Cat's Meow and had took an afternoon drive out to <br/>
Detroit, Oregon for some awesome letterboxes, The Trail Where They <br/>
Cried, The Black Dahlia, Yellow Rose of Texas, My First Fish by <br/>
Pandora and Iron Bear and Mudstumpers' Ollalie Lake. All are alive <br/>
and well and some of the most beautiful stamps I have ever seen! The <br/>
Trail Where They Cried was the most challenging and beautiful hike we <br/>
have ever done and I was so proud of Cat's Meow for being able to <br/>
finish the hike with me. The story behind the clues and the scenery <br/>
was so inspiring that you had to attempt it but the trail that you <br/>
need to follow at times would disappear and become so treacherous <br/>
that it was difficult to navigate. Walking through the burned out <br/>
forest was a very sad experience but beautiful at the same time <br/>
because you are passing through a lush green forest into a barren <br/>
section of land but coming upon 3 different lakes to cool off in. The <br/>
stamp images are well worth the blood, sweat and tears that you will <br/>
shed along the way. These are stamps that I will treasure forever and <br/>
an experience that I will never forget! Thank you Pandora and Iron <br/>
Bear for creating such a wonderful series!<br/>

Hi Secret Gardeners,<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to Iron`Bear this morning and we would be interested in going - we<br/>
would need a lot of advance notice to plan a trip like that and get<br/>
everything we would need prepared, like passports and hotel arrangements<br/>
time off work, ect ect - But we would definitely try to make it if you<br/>
arranged something out that way, we would love to meet you guys and Canada<br/>
Goose - her letterboxes were the first one's we ever went for.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you do try and organize something and that you get a great turn out!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<br/>
Brown's Point Lighthouse Mini Meet<br/>
<br/>
Hi--for anybody out there who is interested in joining us, a few <br/>
letterboxers from the region will get together from 2-4 pm (may last <br/>
longer if the kids want to play for a while) on 31 July 04 at <br/>
Brown's Point Park (Lighthouse), WAY-WAY North Tacoma (practically <br/>
Federal Way at this point) to meet with Spacy Holly and her <br/>
letterboxing family from Southern California for exchanges.  <br/>
<br/>
We plan on meeting at the flag pole in front of (West) of the <br/>
lighthouse keepers cottage.  The park offers expansive and <br/>
incredible views of the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound, Vashon &amp; <br/>
Maury Islands, and depending on the tides lots of opportunity for <br/>
beachcombing and boulder scrambling.  There's even <br/>
enough 'greenspace' to throw a football or frisbee.  We plan on <br/>
bringing some picnic items, too.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you plan on joining us then.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we'll see you there?<br/>
<br/>

*************************<br/>
<br/>
Directions to park:<br/>
<br/>
Brown's Point Park<br/>
intersection of Ton A Wan Da NE &amp; Tok A Lou Av NE<br/>
Brown's Point (Tacoma), WA<br/>
Pierce County<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From I-5 North &amp; South: Take I-5 to Tacoma. Turn onto I-705 North, <br/>
then head North on WA 509 North (also named Marine View Dr). Head <br/>
North for several miles as you wind your way around the Port of <br/>
Tacoma. As you approach the residential area of Brown's Point, turn <br/>
Left on Le Lou Wa Place NE. Continue on this road until you see the <br/>
park on your left. Start at the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
There's a shorter way to reach the park from the North (Federal <br/>
Way/Des Moines/Seattle)--I just don't have a map near me at the <br/>
moment.<br/>

Unfortunately with the summer being upon us and Sim Kitty being out of<br/>
school and traveling with different family members we would not be able to<br/>
commit to anything until right before the gathering. I can tell you that if<br/>
we have Sim Kitty this weekend we will probably try to make it up there for<br/>
the gathering - if not we will probably pass and try to get some extra work<br/>
time in this weekend.  I am sure that Steve and Kris will be there and I<br/>
personally would like to give Sim Kitty a change to meet and play with the<br/>
Rayvenhaus kids!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can probably let you know for sure on Friday or so if you need RSVPs -<br/>
otherwise just count us as a big Maybe hehehhehe<br/>

This is just a chance to get-together to meet Spacy Holly &amp; family <br/>
who are visiting from Southern California (I think she grew up in <br/>
this area &amp; has placed a box or two in Renton?).  The Brown's Point <br/>
Park venue doesn't really support a bunch of conventional boxes <br/>
(although alternative boxes might prove interesting) so it's really <br/>
just a meet &amp; greet type thing not really a blow out LB gathering.  <br/>
I'm learning that many of the regulars are unable to attend because <br/>
of other commitments.  Unfortunately, I'm unable to adjust the time <br/>
with Spacy Holly as she &amp; her family are enroute and don't/won't <br/>
have email access on the trip.  I also don't have a phone number to <br/>
contact them before I see them in person on Saturday.  <br/>
<br/>
For folks who are unable to join us on Saturday, you could probably <br/>
still link up with Holly for an exchange at the Lighthouse Keeper's <br/>
Cottage on the park grounds sometime during the weekend/week <br/>
following 31 Jul.  Just ask for her by name.  She has plans to <br/>
letterbox around the Puget Sound region during the week so I can't <br/>
pass along any more 'concrete' times during which you can link up <br/>
with her there apart from Sat from 2-4pm.<br/>
<br/>
It's a gorgeous venue so you won't be disappointed in spending a few <br/>
hours at the beach with an opportunity to 'dabble' a little bit in <br/>
letterboxing while you're there.  Oh, dogs are allowed.  Also, there <br/>
are a few other letterboxes just a few miles away from this park <br/>
(Dash Pt--think Trial N Error) so you can enjoy some other local <br/>
gems, too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there,<br/>

New letterbox: Ah, Little Mt. Si!<br/>
North Bend, King County, WA<br/>
Placed by: Danny<br/>
Box webpage located at:<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Ah, Little Mt. Si! Letterbox<br/>
Planted on July 25, 2004 by Keegan the Airedale Terrier, Piper, Toast Boy<br/>
and Loud Eyes.<br/>
Day Hikers Only<br/>
No Bicycles or Horses<br/>
This is a 5-mile roundtrip hike.<br/>
1,200 feet gained in elevation.<br/>
The top of Little Mt. Si (pronounced sigh) is 1,576 feet above sea level.<br/>
The trail has some steep sections with roots and rocks that require hand<br/>
holds. Hiking time roundtrip is approximately 3 to 4 hours. Be sure to take<br/>
the 10 essentials plus water and/or your favorite beverage. A camera and<br/>
binoculars will come in handy. Colored markers will make the rubber stamped<br/>
image cooler!<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions:<br/>
<br/>
Drive I-90 to the town of North Bend and take exit 31 into town. Turn right<br/>
heading east on the main drag of North Bend Way. Just east of town turn<br/>
left, heading north on Mount Si Road (432nd SE). Cross the bridge over the<br/>
Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River. Bear right just past the bridge and<br/>
drive a 1/4 mile more to the new parking lot on the left. The lot is<br/>
designed to hold 50 cars and includes a new outhouse. If the lot is full,<br/>
you can park back at the old lot next to the bridge and walk to the<br/>
trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first letterbox planted in an eventual series along the trail<br/>
to the summit of Little Mt. Si. Clues will be added to this webpage, once<br/>
other letterboxes are in place. Please stay tuned!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From the parking lot, follow the signs to the top of Little Mt. Si. The<br/>
&gt;trail snakes through a beautiful forest and past rock faces used by rock<br/>
&gt;climbers.<br/>
<br/>
Once on top, take in the nearly 180 degree view of the Snoqualmie River<br/>
Valley, Snoqualmie Pass, McClellan Butte, Mailbox Peak, Rattle Snake Ledge,<br/>
North Bend, and of course Mt. Si.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Embedded in the rock at the top of Little Si are two metal, round National<br/>
Geodetic Survey Reference Markers. The northern most marker is at the<br/>
highest point of Little Si. Search for the second marker approximately 20<br/>
paces towards the south. Stand on top of the southern lower marker and take<br/>
a compass bearing of 250 degrees magnetic. Scramble down hill in this<br/>
direction for approximately 20 to 25 paces. Look for a blown down tree with<br/>
a root ball. Inside the protected root ball is a rock cairn that contains<br/>
the Ah, Little Mt. Si! Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my seventh planted letterbox. Please email me with any questions or<br/>
comments at Keegan62002@yahoo.com.<br/>

Subject: DMS's adopted! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Hi everyone,<br/>
I'm back from camping up on Mt. Hood and am full of enthusiasm,<br/>
especially since y'all have stepped forward to adopt some of Der Mad<br/>
Stamper's boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks go to:<br/>
<br/>
Pandora (for helping out on all things 'Letterbox')<br/>
Brett (for offering to adopt Lost)<br/>
Funhog (for adopting Bronson Creek)<br/>
and Green Hornet (for the original placement of Rock Creek #1 and #2<br/>
and for agreeing to help out with the other Rock Creek boxes)<br/>
<br/>
BTW: Green Hornet mentioned that the Troll box might not be on THPRD<br/>
property and he is correct.  Also, I'm only monitoring those boxes on<br/>
THPRD lands, so this one and any others NOT on district lands will be<br/>
out of my purview.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I'll add my own 2 cents about local letterboxing history (re:<br/>
Pandora, 7/21).  I agree wholeheartedly that such an icon's boxes<br/>
should be maintained as symbols of the local fun.  I won't wax<br/>
patriotic or any such drivelly thing, but I like the idea of keeping<br/>
DMS's name alive, and I'm sure he'd appreciate it too.<br/>

Today my wife and I want letterboxing in the Estacada area.  We <br/>
found a bunch but were stumped by a few of them.  I was wondering if <br/>
anyone has found the following boxes recently and if so do they have <br/>
any advice to help us.<br/>
<br/>
At McIver State Park<br/>
<br/>
Special Delivery<br/>
Sunburst<br/>
Mini Cooper<br/>
<br/>
And at Timber Park<br/>
<br/>
Whippet Litter - Whippet<br/>
Bistro<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also couldn't find the Icebox at Feyrer park but I think it was <br/>
because were too tired to figure out the clue.<br/>

We did find the Jurasic Park boxes and the county park boxes at <br/>
Carver, Barton, and Metzger.  Eagle Fern park is for the next couple <br/>
of days.<br/>

&gt; Wow! Great response to this idea!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right now the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend looks like a good bet. <br/>
So the<br/>
&gt; gathering would be on Sat Oct 9th.<br/>
&gt; This is also a huge weekend for Historic Fort Langley with the <br/>
annual<br/>
&gt; Cranberry Festival, so lots to see and do as well as hunting for<br/>
&gt; letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did I miss an earlier post proposing a gathering in Fort Langley?<br/>
<br/>
I've been hearing about letter boxing for years, have my stamp/s<br/>
carved, and am still trying to talk a few friends into trying this. <br/>
Their reaction is mostly, "huh?"<br/>
