                    <div class="plaintext-content">We headed off to Mt. Rainier with a relative from Illinois in tow, <br/>
and managed to hit 2 letterboxes despite the relative not being very <br/>
fond of a sport that requires the great outdoors. I have found this <br/>
to be true of most of my DH's relatives in the midwest-we have tried <br/>
to get them outside, to no avail. It reached the point of the <br/>
ludicrous when a whole host of inlaws came with us to Pacific Beach, <br/>
WA and a few never even made it to the beach! And some more declined <br/>
Lake Quinalt in favor of renting movies in the room! AAAAHHHHHHH!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thats a subject for my therapist, we visited "Dammed Alder", <br/>
right where it should be, cute little box and us only the 3rd to <br/>
stamp in! Found some blackberries just down the hill from it,too-an <br/>
added bonus!<br/>
<br/>
Though I brought the clues to Comet Falls, we didn't get it due to <br/>
the above mentioned relative. The views from Paradise were gorgeous <br/>
though, and the wildflowers are in bloom. Get up there if you can.<br/>
<br/>
We hit the "Elbe Train" on the way home, though the relative was not <br/>
pleased with overgrowth on the trail! Great stamp as I have a 2 year <br/>
old train addict. It got stamped all over her body!<br/>
<br/>
A nice day, and letterboxing to boot!<br/>
