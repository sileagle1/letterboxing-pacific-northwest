 Oooooh... someone has been there recently! What was with the box? Was<br/>
there a logbook in the thing? a stamp? When I was last there, it only<br/>
contained a cryptic message about the book being out on loan nothing<br/>
else. Funhog<br/>

Yah, we have actually been up there twice this spring.  All was intact:  stamp and logbook and we left the HH there.  We think maybe prankster had it.  You might want to check it out.  We noticed a number of people have accidentally found that one before.  <br/>
By the way, we were all over the memorial at Pony Tail and couldn't find yours or his supreme highness Ryan boxes.  Have the clues changed?  We used the clues on the master clue list for Oregon.         <br/>

<br/>
Who the hell is prankster? Three of us did that hike. I had already<br/>
seen the box but the other two had never been there before. they found<br/>
the box but have no stamp to show for it. It was disappointing to say<br/>
the least... BTW it isn't customary to reveal where you left a<br/>
hitcher. Usually, the person who finds it reveals its hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; By the way, we were all over the memorial at Pony Tail and couldn't<br/>

<br/>
No changes. Ryan's box is not an easy find. It took me more than one<br/>
try. It isn't in the "obvious" hiding place. Mine, however, is not<br/>
known to give people too much difficulty.  Did you find the live octopus?<br/>
