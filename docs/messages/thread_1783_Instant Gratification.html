This month's offerings are:<br/>
Santa and friends by Pupp<br/>
Dreidel by Maiden<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you read the instructions carefully for dreidel. Half the fun of<br/>
this one is following the instructions.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>

Gratification box has been badly vandalized. One of the two stamps was<br/>
missing and the log book was also gone. I plan to go out and pick it up<br/>
tomorrow and move it to another park.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Sunshine for her efforts at recovering the pieces that were<br/>
left and rehiding the box until I could get there.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have the box rehidden next weekend so look for new clues and new<br/>
stamps in the box sometime next Saturday afternoon.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I picked up the vandalized Instant Gratification box today. I found the box<br/>
open again and one of the stamps about 20 feet away while the other one was<br/>
gone along with the log book. The only thing I found that was encouraging,<br/>
it wasn't any fault of anyone that the box got found. The parks people came<br/>
through and mowed down all of the grass that had once hidden the pile of<br/>
rocks the box was hidden in. They were planting trees in the area and took<br/>
out all the grass. This box has been pulled and will be replaced in a new<br/>
location on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
When it is replaced it will have a bounty of stamps. The January, February,<br/>
and March holiday stamps will all be placed in it until the end of March.<br/>
Then those will be pulled and we will return to our regular schedule of<br/>
having two stamps per month in it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and I hope you are able to get out there before the end of March to<br/>
pick up these fun stamps.<br/>
