Joker's Wild Letteboxing Poker Run!<br>
<br>
When?<br>
~October 1st, 2005<br>
Register and get your packet from 9:30  9:55 AM. The poker run <br>
begins at 10:00 exactly. You DON'T want to be late! <br>
<br>
Where?<br>
~Oxbow Regional Park in Gresham, Oregon. Exact location <br>
within the park to follow as the date gets closer. <br>
<br>
What is a Poker Run? <br>
~Definition: A Poker Run is an organized motorcycle event where <br>
riders travel over a prescribed course and at designated <br>
stopping points, select a card. At the end of the run, the person <br>
with the best poker hand wins a prize. But we decided to change <br>
it a bit and make it a letterboxing event. 53 cards will be hidden in <br>
the park. At 10:00 you will receive clues to the cards. Without <br>
knowing which card is at which location, you have to find 7 cards <br>
and make the best hand you can in two hours. <br>
<br>
Are there prizes? <br>
~Of course! <br>
<br>
Is it kid friendly?<br>
~You bet. <br>
<br>
What about lunch? I'm going to be hungry after finding all those <br>
boxes!<br>
~We will have a potluck. Bring a main dish or salad to share <br>
along with beverages for your family. We'll provide paper <br>
products and dessert!<br>
<br>
Can I stay the night?<br>
~Oxbow's campsites are open year-round and available on a <br>
"first-come, first-served" basis. Maximum occupancy is six <br>
people and two cars per site. Firewood is available for purchase <br>
at $4 per bundle. Camping fee is $15 per night. There is also a <br>
$4 per vehicle entrance fee to the park.<br>
<br>
Please RSVP to Maiden at maiden1974@verizon.net or at <br>
Atlasquest under gatherings.  We hope to see you there! <br>

I will go to atlasquest and RSVP later, but I plan to haul our fifth<br>
wheel over to Oxbow and stay Friday and Saturday night.  I want to at<br>
least find the eight Great Outdoors Series #7 boxes while I'm there. <br>
I would be extremely happy to have company if any women wants a nice<br>
warm place to sleep.  It's a 23-foot rig with a slide-out and very<br>
comfortable fold-down couch, so let me know if anyone wants a place to<br>
sleep.  I have no idea how many boxers like me have partners that have<br>
absolutely no interest at all in boxing but don't mind them going off<br>
for a weekend without them.  I work side by side with my husband all<br>
day, so we actually like to do things apart on the weekends sometimes.<br>
 I also thought maybe someone coming from out of town would like the<br>
option of staying overnight.  Anyway, if someone wants to stay with me<br>
instead of setting up camp on their own let me know.  Sounds like each<br>
site will accommodate two vehicles.<br>

Funny you should bring up camping.  We really want to do the Poker Run.  But<br>
with my health issues, I'd have to get up at around 6:30 to get there by<br>
9:30 and then probably couldn't function well enough to box.  So we'd<br>
thought about taking the RV over and camping.  So you inspire me - maybe<br>
we'll do that.  I'll check on camping at Oxbow and we'll decide.<br>
<br>
I regret I can't be as accommodating but as to offer sleeping in the RV -<br>
getting enough sleep is tricky enough for me.  But I can offer use of it<br>
once I'm up for the day!<br>
<br>
We haven't boxed at Oxbow yet so this would be an opportunity to do that<br>
too!<br>

another - it's first-come-first-served, so we could agree to save a spot <br>

it already, but they don't allow any pets in the park - we have never <br>
camped there overnight for that reason, but doggie can stay home with my <br>
better half for this one!  Hope to see you there rig and all.<br>

<br>
Announcing the first ever <br>
<br>
Joker's Wild Letteboxing Poker Run!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
When?<br>
<br>
~October 1st, 2005<br>
<br>
Register and get your packet from 9:30 to 9:55 AM. The poker run begins at<br>
10:00 exactly. You DON'T want to be late! <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Where?<br>
<br>
~Oxbow Regional Park in Gresham, Oregon. Exact location within the park to<br>
follow as the date gets closer. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
What is a Poker Run? <br>
<br>
~Definition: A Poker Run is an organized motorcycle event where riders<br>
travel over a prescribed course and at designated stopping points, select a<br>
card. At the end of the run, the person with the best poker hand wins a<br>
prize. But we decided to change it a bit and make it a letterboxing event.<br>
53 cards will be hidden in the park. At 10:00 you will receive clues to the<br>
cards. Without knowing which card is at which location, you have to find 7<br>
cards and make the best hand you can in two hours. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Are there prizes? <br>
<br>
~Of course! <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Is it kid friendly?<br>
<br>
~You bet. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
What about lunch? I'm going to be hungry after finding all those boxes!<br>
<br>
~We will have a potluck. Bring a main dish or salad to share along with<br>
beverages for your family. We'll provide paper products and dessert!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Can I stay the night?<br>
<br>
~Oxbow's campsites are open year-round and available on a "first-come,<br>
first-served" basis. Maximum occupancy is six people and two cars per site.<br>
Firewood is available for purchase at $4 per bundle. Camping fee is $15 per<br>
night. There is also a $4 per vehicle entrance fee to the park.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Please RSVP to Maiden at maiden1974@verizon.net or at Atlasquest under<br>
gatherings.  We hope to see you there!<br>
<br>
