Joker's Wild Letteboxing Poker Run!<br/>
<br/>
When?<br/>
~October 1st, 2005<br/>
Register and get your packet from 9:30  9:55 AM. The poker run <br/>
begins at 10:00 exactly. You DON'T want to be late! <br/>
<br/>
Where?<br/>
~Oxbow Regional Park in Gresham, Oregon. Exact location <br/>
within the park to follow as the date gets closer. <br/>
<br/>
What is a Poker Run? <br/>
~Definition: A Poker Run is an organized motorcycle event where <br/>
riders travel over a prescribed course and at designated <br/>
stopping points, select a card. At the end of the run, the person <br/>
with the best poker hand wins a prize. But we decided to change <br/>
it a bit and make it a letterboxing event. 53 cards will be hidden in <br/>
the park. At 10:00 you will receive clues to the cards. Without <br/>
knowing which card is at which location, you have to find 7 cards <br/>
and make the best hand you can in two hours. <br/>
<br/>
Are there prizes? <br/>
~Of course! <br/>
<br/>
Is it kid friendly?<br/>
~You bet. <br/>
<br/>
What about lunch? I'm going to be hungry after finding all those <br/>
boxes!<br/>
~We will have a potluck. Bring a main dish or salad to share <br/>
along with beverages for your family. We'll provide paper <br/>
products and dessert!<br/>
<br/>
Can I stay the night?<br/>
~Oxbow's campsites are open year-round and available on a <br/>
"first-come, first-served" basis. Maximum occupancy is six <br/>
people and two cars per site. Firewood is available for purchase <br/>
at $4 per bundle. Camping fee is $15 per night. There is also a <br/>
$4 per vehicle entrance fee to the park.<br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP to Maiden at maiden1974@verizon.net or at <br/>
Atlasquest under gatherings.  We hope to see you there! <br/>

least find the eight Great Outdoors Series #7 boxes while I'm there. <br/>
I would be extremely happy to have company if any women wants a nice<br/>
warm place to sleep.  It's a 23-foot rig with a slide-out and very<br/>
comfortable fold-down couch, so let me know if anyone wants a place to<br/>
sleep.  I have no idea how many boxers like me have partners that have<br/>
absolutely no interest at all in boxing but don't mind them going off<br/>
for a weekend without them.  I work side by side with my husband all<br/>
day, so we actually like to do things apart on the weekends sometimes.<br/>
 I also thought maybe someone coming from out of town would like the<br/>
option of staying overnight.  Anyway, if someone wants to stay with me<br/>
instead of setting up camp on their own let me know.  Sounds like each<br/>
site will accommodate two vehicles.<br/>

Funny you should bring up camping.  We really want to do the Poker Run.  But<br/>
with my health issues, I'd have to get up at around 6:30 to get there by<br/>
9:30 and then probably couldn't function well enough to box.  So we'd<br/>
thought about taking the RV over and camping.  So you inspire me - maybe<br/>
we'll do that.  I'll check on camping at Oxbow and we'll decide.<br/>
<br/>
I regret I can't be as accommodating but as to offer sleeping in the RV -<br/>
getting enough sleep is tricky enough for me.  But I can offer use of it<br/>
once I'm up for the day!<br/>
<br/>
We haven't boxed at Oxbow yet so this would be an opportunity to do that<br/>
too!<br/>

another - it's first-come-first-served, so we could agree to save a spot <br/>

it already, but they don't allow any pets in the park - we have never <br/>
camped there overnight for that reason, but doggie can stay home with my <br/>
better half for this one!  Hope to see you there rig and all.<br/>

Announcing the first ever <br/>
<br/>
Joker's Wild Letteboxing Poker Run!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When?<br/>
<br/>
~October 1st, 2005<br/>
<br/>
Register and get your packet from 9:30 to 9:55 AM. The poker run begins at<br/>
10:00 exactly. You DON'T want to be late! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where?<br/>
<br/>
~Oxbow Regional Park in Gresham, Oregon. Exact location within the park to<br/>
follow as the date gets closer. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is a Poker Run? <br/>
<br/>
~Definition: A Poker Run is an organized motorcycle event where riders<br/>
travel over a prescribed course and at designated stopping points, select a<br/>
card. At the end of the run, the person with the best poker hand wins a<br/>
prize. But we decided to change it a bit and make it a letterboxing event.<br/>
53 cards will be hidden in the park. At 10:00 you will receive clues to the<br/>
cards. Without knowing which card is at which location, you have to find 7<br/>
cards and make the best hand you can in two hours. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are there prizes? <br/>
<br/>
~Of course! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it kid friendly?<br/>
<br/>
~You bet. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What about lunch? I'm going to be hungry after finding all those boxes!<br/>
<br/>
~We will have a potluck. Bring a main dish or salad to share along with<br/>
beverages for your family. We'll provide paper products and dessert!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can I stay the night?<br/>
<br/>
~Oxbow's campsites are open year-round and available on a "first-come,<br/>
first-served" basis. Maximum occupancy is six people and two cars per site.<br/>
Firewood is available for purchase at $4 per bundle. Camping fee is $15 per<br/>
night. There is also a $4 per vehicle entrance fee to the park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP to Maiden at maiden1974@verizon.net or at Atlasquest under<br/>
gatherings.  We hope to see you there!<br/>

Tooth<br/>
&gt;&gt;Fairy. Isn't that your daughter's name?<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Announcing the first ever<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Joker's Wild Letteboxing Poker Run!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;When?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;~October 1st, 2005<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Register and get your packet from 9:30 - 9:55 AM. The poker run begins <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;at 10:00 exactly. You DON'T want to be late!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Where?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;~Oxbow Regional Park in Gresham, Oregon. Exact location within the park <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;to follow as the date gets closer.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;What is a Poker Run? <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;~Definition: A Poker Run is an organized motorcycle event where riders <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;travel over a prescribed course and at designated stopping points, <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;select a card. At the end of the run, the person with the best poker <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;hand wins a prize. But we decided to change it a bit and make it a <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;letterboxing event. 53 cards will be hidden in the park. At 10:00 you <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;will receive clues to the cards. Without knowing which card is at which <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;location, you have to find 7 cards and make the best hand you can in <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;two hours.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Are there prizes? <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;~Of course! <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it kid friendly?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;~You bet. <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;What about lunch? I'm going to be hungry after finding all those boxes!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;~We will have a potluck. Bring a main dish or salad to share along with <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;beverages for your family. We'll provide paper products and dessert!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Can I stay the night?<br/>
