park today and were fortunate enough to have met Spacy Holly's <br/>
sister in the process.  We were there for a quick reconn--there are <br/>
a handful of picnic tables around the park--lots of open fields for <br/>
frisbee/football type action and plenty of sandy/rocky/boulder edged <br/>
beachfront.  We planning on packing some goodies for a picnic--<br/>
you're welcome to join us!<br/>

Brown's Point Lighthouse Mini Meet<br/>
<br/>
Hi--for anybody out there who is interested in joining us, a few<br/>
letterboxers from the region will get together from 2-4 pm (may last<br/>
longer if the kids want to play for a while) on 31 July 04 at<br/>
Brown's Point Park (Lighthouse), WAY-WAY North Tacoma (practically<br/>
Federal Way at this point) to meet with Spacy Holly and her<br/>
letterboxing family from Southern California for exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
We plan on meeting at the flag pole in front of (West) of the<br/>
lighthouse keepers cottage. The park offers expansive and<br/>
incredible views of the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound, Vashon &amp;<br/>
Maury Islands, and depending on the tides lots of opportunity for<br/>
beachcombing and boulder scrambling. There's even<br/>
enough 'greenspace' to throw a football or frisbee. We plan on<br/>
bringing some picnic items, too.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you plan on joining us then.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we'll see you there?<br/>

<br/>
Well, I've finally got a free moment to post info about last <br/>
Saturday's Blue Moon at Brown's Point event.  We spent a glorious <br/>
sunny afternoon adjacent the water at Brown's Point Park with many <br/>
local and a few not so local letterboxers.  Once the official <br/>
ceremonies concluded, we had exchanged quite a few signature stamps <br/>
(19?):<br/>
<br/>
Spacy Holly &amp; her 4 precious children (from So Cal)<br/>
Holly's relatives Blaze &amp; Sage Cat (from Central WA)<br/>
Snickerdoodle &amp; 5 of the 6 Otter Pops<br/>
Fudrick<br/>
Charlie Trail Duster (from NW Oregon)<br/>
Ole Psyche Vet<br/>

<br/>
The kids really had a blast beachcombing, boulder scrambling, <br/>
octopus sprinkler splashing and playing in and around the lighthouse <br/>
keeper's quarters.  Spacy Holly's relatives were kind enough to <br/>
welcome us to their big reunion and even led us on tours of the <br/>
beautiful &amp; historic lighthouse keeper's quarters and the adjacent <br/>
outbuildings.  What a treasure trove of history &amp; local lore that <br/>
proved to be!  It turned out to be a great opportunity to get to <br/>
know other letterboxers--not terribly steeped in finding lots of new <br/>
letterboxes but, then again, for a park that's only about 2 acres <br/>
big you can only hide so many there according to the Green Turtle's <br/>
rules of letterbox concentration anyway!  ;)  The million dollar <br/>
view &amp; the great budding friendships more than made up for the lack <br/>
of letterboxes.  Oh, we really enjoyed the wedding, too!  See new <br/>
photo under the photos section.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for warmly welcoming Spacy Holly back to the region.  For <br/>
folks who were unable to make the event but would still like to link <br/>
up with Holly for an exchange or five [ :) ], she'll be in the <br/>
region for a few more weeks.  Just coordinate with her directly.<br/>
<br/>
See you back on the letterboxing trails in a few months (it's back <br/>
to medical limbo, work &amp; non-letterboxing overseas travel for me for <br/>
a while),<br/>
