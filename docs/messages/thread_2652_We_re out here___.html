I am working on replanting Everything that Isn't with permission of  <br>
Pandora and Iron Bear. I'm almost done carving so I hope it will be  <br>
available again in the next week or so. It is a fun clue and nice art  <br>
by Iron Bear so you might want to try it if you weren't one of the  <br>
lucky ones to find it before it went missing. I was also planting  <br>
yesterday. It was supposed to be a series of 3 but the best laid  <br>
plans went out the window. Note to self: always bring Velcro! I did  <br>
get 2 boxes planted and will try to post clues today and hope to get  <br>
the 3rd in place soon. These are photo clues and indoor so may be a  <br>
good option for those cold, rainy winter days. Hope to see you all in  <br>
Corvallis!!<br>
Lady<br>
