Look next for a Majestic Mystery #2 in the direction of the sunrise! <br>
Go to the point and travel along the palisades to a viewpoint, it <br>
isn't very far...barely out of view of your car. A lake is below and <br>
blue sky above. An evergreen to the right. No need to leave the <br>
trail, rocks are in line to keep you in line. Look under the skirts <br>
of the evergreen to the first set of rocks. <br>
