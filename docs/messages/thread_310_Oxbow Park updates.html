                    <div class="plaintext-content">We stumped around last weekend at Oxbow and found Funhog's delightful Riverbend box and Cara's beautifully carved #1 Salmon of her Oxbow Series.   However,box #2, eluded us.  We know we were at the right place, because we walked ALL the trails in the Old Growth Forest near and on Trail D, and the clues matched up only to the one location.  We think it is missing or REALLY buried and we were not about to dig for it.  Box 1 was totally exposed so we corrected that, it can slide down by itself if it is not anchored or wedged in.   <br>
 <br>
What a beautiful park and it was fun to have chipmunks and deer amble through your campsite. <br>
