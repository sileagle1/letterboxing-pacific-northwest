                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Great Lakes and Texas just had some cool patches made with their <br>
group logos, and Mid-Atlantic and Northeast put out patches earlier <br>
this year, so I think it's time that all the regional groups should <br>
have patches made. They're usually less than $2 each, and my pack <br>
looks great with patches from all the areas where I've letterboxed, <br>
along with the LbNA patch. And they do work -- I did meet <br>
letterboxers on a trail once who introduced themselves after seeing <br>
the letterboxing patch on my pack!<br>
<br>
Has anyone in this group given any thought to making a cool logo and <br>
patch for this group? Clueless and I have boxed in the PNW, so we'd <br>
certainly be interested in a couple of them. If there's some creative <br>
and industrious person out there who would like to take on the <br>
project -- I'll be happy to put you in touch with some other boxers <br>
who have had patches made so you can quickly research providers. The <br>
LbMA and LbNE groups let members submit ideas for logos, and then <br>
members voted on them before they created their patches.<br>
