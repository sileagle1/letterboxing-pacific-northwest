If you mean the Broughton's Bluff Letterbox, I tried to find<br/>
it last November without success, though I'm pretty sure I<br/>
was in the correct place.  I tried contacting the placer but<br/>
did not receive a response.<br/>
By the way, did you find my Lewis &amp; Clark micro in the park?<br/>

Thanks for letting my know about the Broughtons Bluff.  I was 90% sure we were in the right spot, but there was a lot of dead leaves and debris around so I wasn't going to give a definite lost box announcement. It was a great hike though! <br/>
