 <br>
Had to venture to the Oregon coast this past weekend for a science class field trip, but snuck away to grab a couple easy letterboxes while cruising from spot to spot.  Had fun playing "secret letterboxer agent" and comandeered the Boiler Bay box placed by Carie (it's alive and well!!) and the Freddy at Tadpole's Birthday box placed by the Hoppy Hunters (also alive and well!! - WATCH OUT FOR PUPPY POO, THOUGH!!  YUCH!!).  <br>
 <br>
I also tried to find the Beverly Beach-Beneath the Blue #2 box placed by FunHog, but when I got to what I thought was the garden of fallen giants I realized I didn't have my compass (drats!!!).  Took a wild guess on the compass point, but bombed.  I was under the gun for time, but I'll definately go back and give 'er another whirl!!  I also bombed on the Beneath the Blue #3 at Cape Meares.  <br>
 <br>
I did find enough time to place the "Chris the Crab" box at Cape Foulweather.  If anyone's in that area, it's a great quick-find with a great view!!<br>
 <br>
Toodles!!<br>
