                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings all! I will be donning my diplomat cap on Monday morning and meeting <br/>
with the park manager at Tryon Creek SP. Hopefully we'll be able to work something <br/>
out similar to what we have done with Kyle Spinks at Tualatin Hills Parks and Rec. If <br/>
anyone has anything they would like me to say to the powers that be, please let me <br/>
know in advance. All suggestions will be much appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, if you haven't gotten the classic Mad Stamper boxes in this park, <br/>
this is probably the perfect weekend to get them. If they have to be pulled it won't be <br/>
until after our meeting.  I know Mudstumpers have already removed a couple but <br/>
perhaps they'd be willing to replace them just for the weekend. Cross your fingers <br/>
that they will all be allowed to remain in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Crossing my little pink trotters, Funhog<br/>

You could ask them about the time the whole park was clear cut and <br/>
if letterboxing is somehow more destructive than back in the day <br/>
they clear cut it.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I know, different era, different people in charge.  I'm just <br/>
joking.<br/>
<br/>
But it is kind of amazing to see the place and realize what an <br/>
eyesore it used to be and how far its come along since then.  I was <br/>
shocked when I first learned the area had originally been clear cut.<br/>

We would hate for Funhog to talk them into at least reviewing the locations<br/>
