<br>
After a couple of years, a long hiatus, and numerous unsuccessful <br>
attempts, somebody has FINALLY found this letterbox.  What a comfort <br>
to know it's still there and that somebody has actually stamped into <br>
it.  <br>
<br>
Fudrick attempted it back in Winter 2002/2003 right after it was <br>
first planted AND he was really close--but didn't 'connect'.  Then, <br>
it took a hiatus for a long while.  Then, it was replanted and at <br>
least three groups attempted it since--but no luck.  BUT one recent <br>
seeker was fortunate, the stars/planets aligned and all that jazz <br>
and they actually found it--so if you're looking for a neat place to <br>
take Mom for Mum's Day and a nice place for a stroll in the park, <br>
check out this Wright Letterbox in Tacoma. It's definitely been <br>
waiting for visitors!!!<br>
<br>
And, if you can venture a few miles further West of there, the <br>
rhodies in Pt Defiance Park were planted 50 years ago with the full <br>
intention that they will PEAK this May (ie ASAP) for the 100th <br>
Anniversary of Pt Defiance Park!  So, it's truly a once in a <br>
lifetime opportunity to see some gorgeous plants at their peak of <br>
beauty.  Unfortunately, I'm some 7,000 miles away and won't be able <br>
to enjoy them, yet.  :(<br>
<br>
Not sure about the letterboxes (if any) in the vicinity of these <br>
blooms, but the natural treasures alone should be reason enough to <br>
head out that way. If you can find a letterbox or two along the way, <br>
bonus!!!<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
