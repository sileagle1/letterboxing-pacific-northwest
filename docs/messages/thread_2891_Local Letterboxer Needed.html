have a Southwest Washington Letterbox that was taken out by a storm.<br>
<br>
I recarved a stamp and was going to replant the SW Wash. box, but never <br>
did. I had stashed it away in my carving box and only recently found it.<br>
The location is kind of iffy as there are some areas in Washington that <br>
do not wish any letterboxes. <br>
<br>
If someone in the area (SW Washington) wants to do a replant I can send <br>
the stamp and furnish info where it was planted prior, but that <br>
location might not be the best?<br>
<br>
It would be your plant, not ours as we aren't looking for more P <br>
counts, I just would like the stamp to be used. It is location specific.<br>
