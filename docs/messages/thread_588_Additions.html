Unlike the Main LbNA mailing list Database, which runs on Yahoo, the Database that I am writing does not, in any way, allow for random people to generate MIA reports or anything of that nature. It would only include your boxes, if you entered them.  I'm creating this Database, much similar to the Main LbNA website, with a few caveats thrown in. However, it will NOT allow someone to place a box MIA just because they couldn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes will only be placed into the Database if the planter of that box comes to the PNWLb site and manually enters them into the database there.  Just because Johnny can't find his way out of a wet papersack with both hands and a knife, doesn't mean that he'll get to do anything but post to the forums that he can't find it.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want your boxes listed there, don't enter them and they'll never be there.  (grin)  I hope you'll see what we've got there and join us, but it's by no means mandatory.<br/>
