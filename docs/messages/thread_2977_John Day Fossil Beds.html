                    <div class="plaintext-content">John Day Fossil Beds.  Come now when the weather is cooler but still not freezing.  Take two or three days to visit all three units and don't miss out on visiting Antelope, Mitchell, Clarno, Spray, and Fossil.  Read up a bit on what you'll be seeing.  There are at least two vintage boxes placed by Green Tortuga, some by Kokopelli, some by Stinkerbell, at least one new one by Wood-Aug, and a couple I left there a while back - also others I couldn't even get to.  One of mine starts a new game, so be the first to play.  You will be left with a sense of awe going so far back in time to when Oregon was a tropical forest.  I was born in La Grande and can't believe I waited so long to go here.  Been twice now, and it won't be my last visit to the dry side.  <br/>
