                    <div class="plaintext-content">I trespassed once on a closed down railway line in Paris that I shouldn't<br/>
have gone to for two boxes.  It was so pitch black; I couldn't see anything<br/>
but what my flashlight covered.  The tunnel ended up feeling like it was<br/>
about a mile long.  It probably wasn't quite that long, but it was close to<br/>
that.  It was only as I got partway in, all alone, that it dawned on me that<br/>
nobody in the entire world knew where I was and I was staying all alone in a<br/>
strange country.  If anything were to happen to me, there wasn't anyone that<br/>
would notice when I didn't return.  I had to climb up these unbelievably<br/>
high ladders to find the spots, and then to add insult to everything, both<br/>
boxes were missing.  The built-in ladders in the sides of the tunnel were so<br/>
high that I began to worry about my legs giving out underneath me and me<br/>
falling.  If I had, I would have been very seriously injured.  I repeatedly<br/>
considered turning around the whole time, but every moment I "just knew" the<br/>
box would be around the bend and I had come that far, it seemed like a waste<br/>
to not get the letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
When I returned, I was so eager to get out of that place that I just chose<br/>
to not worry about the fact that there was a group of guys approaching on<br/>
the other side of the fence that I had to hop.  After they saw me, they came<br/>
over and believe it or not started threatening me and acting like I needed<br/>
to pay them to keep from getting me in trouble for being in that spot.  They<br/>
all sort of made a circle around me.  It was so scary--this group of men and<br/>
me all alone!  They were clearly threatening me in French with a couple of<br/>
broken English phrases thrown in.  I managed to get away by playing the<br/>
"dumb American" (sometimes there are a few advantages to looking like an<br/>
obnoxious, stupid tourist.  It's the only time I was grateful for our<br/>
reputation with the French).  I kept acting like I couldn't understand what<br/>
they were trying to say to me. "I'm sorry, I don't speak any French<br/>
(shrugging).  I don't understand what you are saying!"  I kept repeating it<br/>
until they looked utterly frustrated, and then I turned away, looking like I<br/>
regretted my ignorance, and walked as quickly away as I dared.  I was<br/>
petrified that they would follow, but the neighborhood was busy enough, I<br/>
guess it wasn't worth it to them.  I can't tell you how relieved I was!!<br/>
<br/>
This experience taught me one of my most valuable lessons--no letterbox is<br/>
worth putting yourself in danger.  I was incredibly stupid that day and all<br/>
for the sake of finding a box.  I don't know what I was thinking going out<br/>
alone with no way of anyone knowing where I would be, and then I took such<br/>
stupid risks and even trespassed on closed property to find it.  I might not<br/>
have pushed it, but all of my other attempts at finds in France had failed.<br/>
I just wanted one find at least.  I shouldn't have cared that much.  I was<br/>
very lucky to be okay in the end.<br/>
<br/>
It also taught me to be mindful of who was planting.  Most of the<br/>
letterboxes I looked for in France were from the same person that did this<br/>
one.  There were a couple I didn't even attempt, even though I got there and<br/>
could clearly see the spot where the letterbox should be hidden.  One wanted<br/>
me to climb a high wall of a hotel with only finger-sized cracks spider-man<br/>
style.  I have NO idea how she planted that thing!!  The other was after the<br/>
whole railway incident.  I got there and saw that I would have to climb up<br/>
on this big wall that was a fence for someone's personal property and reach<br/>
up into a high lamppost.  After everything else, I looked at it for a bit,<br/>
turned around, and went back to my hostel, never having found a letterbox in<br/>
Paris.  It just wasn't worth it!<br/>
<br/>
Luckily there was one that I looked for that was great.  It turned out to be<br/>
missing, but I had so much fun looking for it that I was okay with it.  I<br/>
spent the day in an amazing spot.  That one wasn't planted by the dissused<br/>
railway chick.  I will not look for another of her boxes when I move to<br/>
Europe!!  I think she's planted all over.<br/>

<br/>
I posted notes on this on the big list and on the AQ France board, hoping to<br/>
warn some others.  As far as I know the boxes are still listed, even though<br/>
this was three years ago that I tried to find them.  It was a crazy story,<br/>
but it makes for a fun one to recount now at least! (-:  I may not have got<br/>
a find, but I have a fairly interesting adventure to recount!<br/>

  I'm sure we're all glad you are okay, and hope that nobody else is going to go to such risk for these or any other boxes, but it's funny how the worst things like this really do make for the best stories.  Like when I got picked up by a forklift while in a port-o-potty last week; not fun at the time, but everybody else sure loves the story!<br/>
<br/>
  I'm sure you've learned your lesson, but be sure in the future to BE CAREFUL!!<br/>

Yeah, I definitely learned my lesson with this one.  I think what taught me<br/>
the lesson was the fact that when I started, I had NO IDEA I would be in for<br/>
such an adventure.  My biggest debate was "should I jump this fence."  I<br/>
knew I probably shouldn't, but decided to since I had spent the day boxing<br/>
and found nothing.  I pushed it for the sake of finding something.<br/>
<br/>
I thought that would be it.  I knew I needed a flashlight, but thought the<br/>
letterbox would be about 20 feet in the tunnel.  Nobody was around.  It<br/>
didn't look unsafe.  I didn't picture a "ladder" being something that could<br/>
get me killed if I fell.  There was no indication that anyone would threaten<br/>
me.  I just faced the moral dilemna about should I go against my nature and<br/>
trespass a bit on property that looked safe and was clearly not being used<br/>
for anything that I thought would be problematic.  I hadn't even thought<br/>
about my being alone because I was in a city.  I don't really hike alone,<br/>
but in cities there are people everywhere.  I thought I would be fine.  It<br/>
just goes to show . . .<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, it's a fun story to remember now that I'm okay!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I forgot other, more normal lengths I've gone to.  How about<br/>
letterboxing in Salt Lake City after the biggest snowstorm in years left 3-4<br/>
of snow in one day!  We had come all the way, we'd be darned if we went all<br/>
that way and didn't find the boxes.  One of them was a bit tricky tough<br/>
because the snow had completly uprooted and pulled down the big tree it was<br/>
planted by.  Amazingly, we still managed to find it!  We were very wet in<br/>
the end after treading into thigh high snow in many spots, but we sure<br/>
enjoyed those boxes and I still smile when I see the stamps!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">haha!  The fact in itself is much of the story.  I finally broke down on a job site and just HAD to go, but while I was in the Johnny-on-the-spot, they decided to move it about 5 feet from where it currently was, which involved picking it up with the fork lift.  Why they didn't check the "in use" thing on the lock or remember that they had seen me go in but not come out (and the guy with the fork lift DID see me go in) I will never know, but damned if they weren't laughing their asses off when I came flying out of there.  I feel fortunate I had a split second of sense enough to fully re-clothe myself, zipping up and all, before I came out.  The forklift operator apologized a lot, and I don't suppose he'll be doing that again any time soon.  It certainly will NOT be happening to me, as I'd sooner go in the bushes as use something that sketchy anymore...  My mother and I realized that if they had been picking it up to take elsewhere, I would possibly have been stuck in there<br/>
 all weekend, since it was a Friday.  Scary...  I may not have been there, but I think I would have preferred the French tunnel to a sanican for a weekend.....<br/>

&gt; boxes sure doesn't seem to mind boundaries much...hmm...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I'm sure we're all glad you are okay, and hope that nobody else is going<br/>
&gt; to go to such risk for these or any other boxes, but it's funny how the<br/>
&gt; worst things like this really do make for the best stories.  Like when I got<br/>
&gt; picked up by a forklift while in a port-o-potty last week; not fun at the<br/>
&gt; time, but everybody else sure loves the story!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I'm sure you've learned your lesson, but be sure in the future to BE<br/>
&gt; CAREFUL!!<br/>

There's one guy who was thru-hiking the AT who got stuck in a privy<br/>
for a half hour or so. =) There was a wooden block that falls into<br/>
place on the outside of the door (you always want to keep the door<br/>
closed to keep the animals out) and it fell into place when he went in<br/>
to do this thing.<br/>

Nobody was around to hear his yelling when it later tried to leave. He<br/>
finally crushed a coffee can thin enough to slide through the crack in<br/>
the door like a credit card and left the wooden bar to get himself out.<br/>

He didn't think the whole situation was very funny, but fortunately,<br/>
he told everyone else about it so we could get a good laugh. =)<br/>

<br/>
  The guys at the site did tell my boss the following Monday, before I even had a chance to, and said they were impressed by how well I handled it.  I thought it was pretty amusing from the get-go, though there was the blinding "OH MY GOD!!" time whilst IN the structure.<br/>
