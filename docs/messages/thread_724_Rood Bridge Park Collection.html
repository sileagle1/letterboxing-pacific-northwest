confirmed this today, the last one has indeed flown away, and such a <br/>
shame, it was a gorgeous stamp (at least I thought so, lol) I have <br/>
replaced it with another in the park, but in a new location, which <br/>
brings the current total up to, lets see, give or take, about 5 boxes <br/>
there now.  It may benefit some people, if they are coming back to <br/>
add to their "collection", to redo the series also... (big fat hint)  <br/>
to newcomers; it's a wonderful walk!  Look for the new ammended clues <br/>
shortly!   Wingnut<br/>
