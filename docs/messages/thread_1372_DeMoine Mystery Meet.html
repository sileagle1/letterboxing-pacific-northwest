organizing the Mystery Meet and greet, what a great time we had! It <br>
was wonderful getting to see family and friends again.  Wow Kris you <br>
sure are looking good these days and Steven  that traveling was the <br>
most incredible thing I have ever seen.  Charlie Trail Duster! What <br>
a treat it was to find out we share the same birthday  can't wait <br>
to celebrate it with you at the birthday parties on Stamp Camp <br>
weekend. Frudrick it is always a pleasure to come across your jolly <br>
smile! As for everyone new that I met, what a joy to put faces to <br>
names, and see all those signature stamps, what a unique bunch we <br>
had at that gathering! I hope that the Pirate Family and the HIJK <br>
family enjoyed themselves and found themselves more obsessed with <br>
letterboxing that before. It was so cool to have a weekend away with <br>
Iron`Bear and have two whole days to box with Camp Fire Lady! We <br>
walked away with a 17F weekend  not to bad at all what a team we <br>
make Lady! I just can't wait for Stamp Camp now!! I hope lots of you <br>
guys end up being able to come out, don't forget to get your <br>
reservations in advance; this is going to be a letterboxing event <br>
full of all sorts of fun, surprises and treats! So get your <br>
reservations now and join us a Battleground lake August 27-29th <br>
