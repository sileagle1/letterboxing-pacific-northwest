<br/>
Last time I was in Redmond visiting mmy bro and family, we stopped <br/>
at Cline Falls to check on my box, to find it was gone.  It really <br/>
wasn't in a great place and the stamp was pretty crappy, so I wasn't <br/>
too upset.  Anyway, thanks to John, he replanted it for me, the <br/>
Cline Box is now a 2nd edition, in a totally new spot, and , even if <br/>
I do say so myself, one of the best stamps I have carved yet!!!!!!!  <br/>
GO GET IT!!!!!<br/>
