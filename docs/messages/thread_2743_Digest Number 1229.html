&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greetings NW Boxers!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'll be in Portland visiting family for a long weekend of March 30 to<br/>
&gt; April 3rd. My brother doesn't 'box but is very tolerant of working<br/>
&gt; them in when we're out and about doing other stuff. I think he<br/>
&gt; should especially tolerant this trip since April 1st is my birthday -<br/>
&gt; no fooling! which is the main reason for my visit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last time I visited we did a road trip to the coast and went to the<br/>
&gt; Portland Zoo where I managed to get all the boxes there except for<br/>
&gt; that pesky Packy's Place which was hiding out in the lost and found<br/>
&gt; office about the time we went looking for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know I'm going to spend time trying for Ace of Fun and most likely<br/>
&gt; the Musician series boxes which will probably wipe out my<br/>
&gt; limited 'boxing time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So....Does anyone have any boxes they'd like to suggest besides these<br/>
&gt; that are relatively easy to get to and which are public transit<br/>
&gt; friendly? I'll only have the full day to myself to box on Tuesday<br/>
&gt; 4/3 but w/o a car, the rest will be fit in around family time - in<br/>
&gt; which case we'd be using a vehicle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm SOOOOO jealous how many boxes you have in the Portland area...way<br/>
&gt; more than my time for this trip will allow. Any input mucho<br/>
&gt; appreciated - on the list or by email.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone thinks they might be up for an exchange and coffee that'd<br/>
&gt; be cool too!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheers!<br/>

&gt; Rats! I will be gone the entire time you're in town. I would've loved<br/>
&gt; to have gone hiking with you. I am just glad we got to meet in the<br/>
&gt; Fall. I think the Musicians Series is a great choice and will probably<br/>
&gt; fill much of your day. I do hope you will be adding one of your own<br/>
&gt; crafting while you're at it. It's become quite a gallery of carvers'<br/>
&gt; work, with fourteen boxes by nine different letterboxers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I always think folks should try for the Spirit of Dartmoor letterbox.<br/>
&gt; It's one of the earliest in the country and is a great piece of our<br/>
&gt; local history. Der Mad Stamper is first rate when it comes to clues as<br/>
&gt; well as carving. Then there's his renown as a karaoke singer but<br/>
&gt; that's another topic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have a ball while you're here and catch me on the next visit. Funhog<br/>
