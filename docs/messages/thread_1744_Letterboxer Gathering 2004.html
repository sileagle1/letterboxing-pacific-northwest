Hello fellow Letterboxers!!  I am Erfellie from Grants Pass, Oregon <br>
(Celtic horse stamp). I know as winter comes it can often be too <br>
chilly or snowy to make all those long hikes to find our precious <br>
LB's so I thought we could do a Letterbox gathering which I am <br>
personally inviting you too and any of you LB friends and family. <br>
Unfortunately some of our best trail buddies, the four legged <br>
furries, won't be able to attend since it will be held indoors at<br>
a restaurant. The gathering will be held on Saturday December 4th, <br>
2004 at Wild River Brewing and Pizza Company 595 Northeast "E" Street<br>
Grants Pass, OR  97526 Phone: (541) 471-7487 at 3:00pm. Please <br>
respect that it IS a non-smoking facility. Average meal price (not <br>
included in event) is about $10 and they do offer some vegetarian <br>
food. If you would like to know more about this restaurant their <br>
website is http://wildriverbrewing.com/. Email me if you need <br>
directions, its very easy to find from I-5. I do ask that you must <br>
RSVP with me so that I can reserve the space at the restaurant; <br>
please do so by November25, 2004. To RSVP please go to <br>
www.letterboxing.org, go to the map of Oregon, Click on Area 6, and <br>
click on "Heart of Grants Pass Letterbox" (or any of my other<br>
LB'S) and use the "Contact Placer" option. The earlier the RSVP the<br>
better, and please include your trail name (and real name if you <br>
like) and email address. I promise it will be a fun winter gathering <br>
you won't want to miss! For far travelers, visit <br>
http://www.grantspass.com/ for information on hotels, maps, or <br>
anything else you might need to make your trip easier. Thank you so <br>
much and I hope to see you there!!! In the meantime, Happy Hunting! <br>
Keep warm!<br>
Erfellie <br>

  You've given me a great idea dvn2rckr, maybe instead of doing a <br>
picnic type gathering we could have a weekend campout gathering :o) <br>
That would be lots of fun and I know of the perfect place, its <br>
surrounded by pristine waterfalls that are run off from glaciers (a <br>
bit chilly for swimming) and lots of huckleberries *yum* so if BLM <br>
clears the landslide blocking the way there (its been there for <br>
almost 2 years) it would be  a great place to do an event. I guess <br>
the government is waiting for another 2 million dollars of tax payers <br>
money to clear the landslide and its not one you can just 4x4 over, <br>
youll slide off down a steep mountainside, not a pretty thing at all, <br>
nope nope. Well, maybe next summer :o) in the mean time, I will just <br>
keep planting LB's out here for the people brave enough to hike in <br>
the winter hehe :o) <br>
  Funhog: I was looking forward to meeting you, Sandi (My trusty LB <br>
sidekick) and I keep debating on whether your a man or a woman, you <br>
seem secretive about this haha I think your a woman (if im wrong, im <br>
very very sorry) :o) We always enjoy finding your stamps, your great <br>
at carving them. <br>
