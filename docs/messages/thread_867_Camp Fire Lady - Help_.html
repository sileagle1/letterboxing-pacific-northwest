Well it's no wonder that a few stamps were missed with the stamping <br>
frenzy that went on Saturday. I would be happy to send you the images <br>
by mail if you would like to have them now. Email of list with you're <br>
address and I will send them out. Willow and I and the kids have been <br>
working our way out your way and I think Estacada was our next <br>
location to hit. It took us a few trips to Forrest Park to get all <br>
the 22 stamps there so we will be moving on South soon. I will keep <br>
you posted when we head that way. Willow and I have a few Camp Fire <br>
events coming up so we will check our calendars. It was so nice to <br>
meet you and I look forward to hooking up with you again.<br>
