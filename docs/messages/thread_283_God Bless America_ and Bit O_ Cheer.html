Wingnut, <br/>
<br/>
Would have loved to bump into you at the god bless america box yesterday, we got that box around noon. I was most dissapointed to be foiled by the bit o' cheer though. As you mentioned the area is very busy and I began to wonder if I was in the wrong place. Since you were successful I will give it another go when I am next in the area.<br/>
<br/>
By the way the third member of our party is "See Biscuit' my ever present companion who is easily identified by her enthusiasm for all things eatable... and letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Hedgehog<br/>
