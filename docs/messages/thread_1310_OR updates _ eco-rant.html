                    <div class="plaintext-content">In the last few days, I have checked up on a number of my Portland Boxes. All of the <br>
following are in place and ready to rock:<br>
Oaks Bottom, Doyle Owl, Crystal Springs, What's for Dinner, Bishops Close (with new <br>
log,) Hidden Dragon and both Oak Island boxes. <br>
(BTW the camas and wild rose are blooming on Sauvie Island!)<br>
<br>
While making the rounds of my babies, I ran into some destruction at the site of one <br>
that REALLY bummed me out. One of the boxes is concealed beneath a huge fallen <br>
limb. Someone had ripped almost all the bark off the thing for about ten feet. The <br>
bark was scattered everywhere smothering the wildflowers and grasses. Sheesh! I'm <br>
the one who returns every rock and stick back to its original position, fluffs up <br>
crushed grasses and sweeps away my footprints whenever possible. This just about <br>
killed me...<br>
<br>
I'm hoping, hoping, hoping that this was not the work of an over-zealous letterboxer. <br>
I'm probably preaching to the choir but let it be known that none of my letterboxes <br>
will ever require digging, removal of bark, disassembling of walls or any other kind of <br>
environmental destruction. Amen! Funhog<br>
