 <br>
Your clues are brilliant and very entertaining. Congratulations on a job well done... make that TWO jobs well done!  You do realize, however, that now we are all going to expect you to maintain your new high standards for clue-writing, don't you?  Good luck!<br>
 <br>
Thanks for sharing.<br>

Your friend,<br>

Hey everyone :) Maybe if some of you letterboxers are bored you can <br>
help me out by reading some clues I wrote. I am trying to take that <br>
next step from beginner to experienced letterboxers (even though I<br>
have been at it for almost 2 years) but most of my previously placed <br>
letterboxes arent super creative, mostly a spiral bound pack of index <br>
cards forthe logbook and very direct straightforward clues. So for<br>
the last 2 days I have been in super duper creative mode (rainy days<br>
do <br>
that to me) so i was hoping that if anyone out there is bored enough<br>
to read the stories I made up for my clues and throw out an opinion or<br>
two with mayne constructive critisicm. They are on the LBNA site<br>
under <br>
these adresses below or if the links dont work, Oregon, Region 6, box <br>
names Applegate trail and Myrtle the Turtle. Enjoy them :o) They are <br>
supposed to be funny. <br>
