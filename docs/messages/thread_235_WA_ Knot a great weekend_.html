three for Pack Forest and one for Umptanum Falls.<br>
<br>
I arrived at Pack early yesterday and could find no "take away" <br>
maps.  After studying the trailhead maps I realized that my original <br>
plan was a bit stymied by distance and circumstance.  Because this <br>
area is a classroom, there may be road and trail closures at any time.<br>
<br>
I hiked in my intended route but met with "road closed due to heavy <br>
equipment" signs.  I decided that I was not comfortable placeing at <br>
this time.  The director of the facility was most welcoming and <br>
encouraged me to contact him, so I will get back with him and find <br>
out what trail option is most likely to be available to visitors at <br>
any time.  A family I met as I was leaving says they often fail to <br>
take down the closed signs on the weekend ( when there is no forestry <br>
activity) so they tend to ignore them.  I did not feel comfortable <br>
with this so I will plan for placement after visiting with the <br>
director.<br>
<br>
I did give the family a flier on Letterboxing. :-D<br>
<br>
Today I drove east and visited Fudricks new box in Ellensburg.  ( <br>
nice stamp fun use of clues) I posted a while back that I would be <br>
placing a box at Umptanum Falls, which is about 9 miles from Fudricks <br>
box.<br>
<br>
I got up to the falls area and thought it mighty interesting that on <br>
Memorial Day, the parking lot was empty and very clean.<br>
<br>
I hiked in about 15 minutes and found out why.  The through trail to <br>
the falls, which passes over private land, has been heavily fenced <br>
and friendly No Trespass this means you signs posted everywhere.<br>
<br>
Ah me, such a nice modest hike to a pretty venue.  I could try making <br>
an adventure hike using compass bearings, but did not feel this was a <br>
good ploy in such rugged, isolated area.<br>
<br>
So I planted the box in a nice area.  It is not much of a hike, but a <br>
nice spot for a picnic and nature study.  It is not that far from the <br>
freeway, but it feels miles away.  It makes a nice 1 - 2 with <br>
Fudricks box.  A third box at Ginko makes for a solid day of boxing, <br>
Eastern Washington style.<br>
