<br>
1. Go to the website; click on "Search for Boxes"; choose the state you want, <br>
then under placer, choose "Abandonedbox."<br>
<br>
2. Try to contact the original placer, if you know/can find an e-mail for <br>
that person.  <br>
<br>
3. If that fails, and you want to adopt the box, copy the clues information.  <br>
<br>
4. Go to "Submit clues" and do the usual stuff to create a "new" box, pasting <br>
in the info you've copied under the "clues" part.   I would add something <br>
like "This box was originally placed by Der Mad Stamper in July 2000; I am <br>
currently maintaining the box to prevent it from being dropped from the website."<br>

additional step: <br>
search under the box's name to make sure no one in your area has <br>
already adopted the box (or that the owner hasn't already listed <br>
it under their own name, and it's just duplicated in the abandonedbox list).<br>
