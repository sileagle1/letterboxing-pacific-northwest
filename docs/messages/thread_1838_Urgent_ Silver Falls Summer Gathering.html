The first weekend in July really works well for us--it may even work <br>
for my letterboxing family members from out of state/region, too.  <br>
Put us down for 2 tents in the group camp area for both nights.<br>

Any chance of the 2nd & 3rd? The 1st is a Friday night, a bit <br>
difficult for those of us coming from points farther north. (hard to <br>
set up in the dark...)<br>

Pencil us in for two tents with 4-5 people.<br>

There's no requirement to come both nights. Some folks will probably <br>
do a day trips only too. <br>

Our group will definitely have 3 people, possibly 5 and will have 2 <br>
small tents and 1 (possibly 2) car(s).  Three of us and 1 tent will <br>
be there for both nights (not sure on the others yet).  We'd love to <br>
contribute funds to help offset the cost of this, as well.<br>
