                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been LBing for only about a year and have enjoyed this great opportunity.  I keep an eye on the listserve to see what issues are being dealt with and find the feedback very, very helpful.  I never thought I'd be writing, myself, looking for advice from my fellow letterboxers.  Here's my dilemna...<br>
 <br>
A park ranger from one of the state parks somehow came upon one of my boxes.  Never hearing of Letterboxing, a red flag went up.  No one had cleared the proper channels for placing this box on State park property (isn't all state park property "public"?).  Luckily, instead of just pulling the box and trashing it with no notification (which she told me she had full rights to do), she went to the letterboxing website and "contacted the placer".  I responded to her friendly inquiry by meeting with her at the park's interpretive center, where we discussed the "5 W's and 1 H" of Letterboxing.  <br>
 <br>
She was impressed by the size of the loosely organized group and how well it was organized and governed without the need of an administrative branch or hierarchy.  She stated how interested she was in creating a "partnership" with us throughout Oregon's state parks.  I didn't quite know how to respond to that.  I didn't feel it was my place to say "yes" or "no" or to pursue the issue any farther without bringing this to the listserve to see what the veterans thought.  It's my thinking that some of you veterans have already dealt with the State Park system before and might know how to handle this situation.  <br>
 <br>
It's my thinking that this organization is working excellently all on its own WITHOUT a government agency's "partnership".  Many times, once the government gets involved, things tend to go south.  The park ranger did remind me that a permit process is in place for placing such things within State Park boundaries, which places our precious boxes at the hands of the officials.  It covers the liability issues, etc.  They approve the spot we choose to hide our boxes as well.<br>
 <br>
She is aware that if she were to remove the box, chances are the box would be replaced in a more inaccessible hiding spot, so she knows that this is something that would be hard to govern without spending alot of time monitoring the website and finding the boxes for the sole intention of destroying it.  She also realizes the increase of visitors because of the boxes and doesn't want to discourage it.  There are State Park people who wouldn't think twice of clearing State Park grounds of such "ridiculous trash".  They've had a few bad experiences with geocachers and their ammo-boxes being found.  In this terrorist-geared world, coming across an ammo-box is nothing short of creepy to say the least!!!  Bomb squads had been called in on one occasion (can you imagine their faces when they opened the box?!!).<br>
 <br>
The State Park system has the "Junior Ranger" program for kids and it's becoming very stagnant.  She's looking at letterboxing as a means to "jump-start" the program that is geared towards kids 6-12.  By working with letterboxers, she'd like to start a program where a scheduled a stamp creating workshop is facilitated at the interpretive center and boxes can be hidden in the area of the center that depicts subjects that would bring a fun educational experience that folks could "do" (lots better than sitting for 20 minutes watching an interpretive video).<br>
 <br>
Her intentions appeared completely "good", but I'm still skeptical of the proposal she has in mind.  What do y'all think?  I'd like to respond to her on behalf of the letterboxing community of the Pacific Northwest.  I look to you for the voice of the group, especially from those of you who have been letterboxing for many years and/or those of you who have had experiences with the State Park system.<br>
 <br>
Thanks so much for any responses!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's quite understandable that state parks want to know what's going <br>
on in their territory to monitor it--both for the safety of the <br>
environment and the public.<br>
<br>
Working together with such authorities is definitely within our best <br>
interests.  Working against them could get letterboxing banned <br>
completely.  Hammering out something that works well for both sides <br>
of the table--go for it!<br>
<br>
Such cooperation can also help in the future as other administrative <br>
divisions learn about letterboxing and, at the very least, want to <br>
monitor its impact in their jurisdiction.  We could use our <br>
cooperation with the state parks as a model for future 'authoritative <br>
encounters'.  (Much scarier than any bear encounters, if you ask me!)<br>
