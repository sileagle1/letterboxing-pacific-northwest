place to pitch a tent. Knowing that there are letterboxes AND<br/>
campsites off exit 61, this seemed to be the perfect place to leave<br/>
I-5. I'm driving along, minding my own business and what do I see a<br/>
few miles west? My very own viewpoint and creek! Plus, its sole<br/>
purpose for existence is having fun! I had to scurry along to beat the<br/>
sun but the next morning I was up bright and early to see this<br/>
fabulous place.<br/>
<br/>
I was so excited about visiting my very own creek that I skipped<br/>
breakfast (except for one Oreo) and headed back upriver. I pulled into<br/>
the parking lot, sat on a curb and decide that since I couldn't go<br/>
have fun with all the other people parking here, I'd do the next best<br/>
thing: hide a letterbox. With a rumbling belly, I carved a stamp. It<br/>
was still before 10, a bit late but a perfectly acceptable time for<br/>
breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
Being a hog I'm pretty darn good at rooting out something good to eat.<br/>
So I put on my shades, the sun blazing in my eyes and headed for a<br/>
shady path. Being August, the blackberries were in their prime and<br/>
there was a pile of them just ahead on the left. Now I was stained<br/>
with berry juice as well as stamping ink. I know some pigs are quite<br/>
fond of acorns. A pity I'm not one of them because there was an oak<br/>
tree on the right with three trunks. What a mother lode of acorns!<br/>
Perhaps I could find some truffles buried in their midst. I scratched<br/>
around to no avail but left a confection of my own behind in that<br/>
leafy spot.<br/>
