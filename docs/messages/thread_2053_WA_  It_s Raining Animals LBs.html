departure so have gone many of the letterboxes in the "It's Raining <br/>
Animals" Letterbox Series located down in Olympia, WA.  It sounds as if <br/>
only one of the letterboxes in this 4 LB series is still 'alive' but <br/>
it, too, is not faring very well.  So, in an attempt to limit future <br/>
seekers' frustrations, I'm going to retire this series completely. <br/>
Please discard your clues.<br/>
<br/>
Who knew that such a little park would prove so popular for <br/>
letterboxing (&amp; alternative treasure hunting hobbies)???  Or perhaps <br/>
the animals simply became 'real' and walked off on their own?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail,<br/>
