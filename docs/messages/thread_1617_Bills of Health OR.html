                    <div class="plaintext-content">This afternoon I made the rounds of several of my Portland letterboxes. I'm pleased <br>
to note that all are doing fine. This includes: Doyle Owl, Crystal Springs, Oaks Bottom, <br>
and Bishop's Close. The only casualty I came across today was that pesky space <br>
invader, The Big Y letterbox. This strange letterbox with no known owner or clue has <br>
disappeared from it's hidey hole. I would love to know the story of this oddity but I <br>
guess it will forever remain a mystery. Funhog<br>
