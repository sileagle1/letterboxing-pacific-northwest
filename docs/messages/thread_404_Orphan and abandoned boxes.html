                    <div class="plaintext-content">I reviewed the list and see that there are several boxes that we know <br/>
are alive and owned by active boxers like dvn2r skr and fudrick.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect, like three of mine, they forgot to transfer the clues over <br/>
when the whole system flopped over.<br/>
<br/>
I almost missed the whole thing, thinking the transfer was going to <br/>
be automatic ( I just read the digest for PNW happenings)<br/>
<br/>
I see some placed by people who have disappeared like thunder and tea <br/>
thyme and some that just appear to have dropped out of the whole <br/>
thing like DZ Dezi and Sunseeker.<br/>
<br/>
I have resent an e mail to the webmasters about my Kennedy Creek <br/>
boxes that they say are abandoned.  If they don't show up on the page <br/>
I will repost my own.<br/>
<br/>
I will review the orphans and take inventory of the eastside boxes <br/>
bellevue kirkland and redmond.<br/>
<br/>
I know the other fragrance lake box is fine I found it on july 5.  I <br/>
sent a postcard to the placers yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I am afraid the webmasters will be flooded soon.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As far as Seattle and south to Portland, I am willing to <br/>
take those over, etc, etc.  I've got a bunch of news ones <br/>
that I'll drop in place this next week or so, depending on <br/>
the time, (I'm in California this week, and there's an <br/>
Airshow at McChord on Sunday, so, we'll be scouting next <br/>
week.) I'd like to have them in place and running as fast <br/>
as possible.  <br/>
<br/>
Tell you badly we're am hooked, when I get back from <br/>
California this Saturday, my other half and are are going <br/>
to hit the Flight Path LB's (6) and the Turkey Dinner LB <br/>
(1) on the way home.  (grin)<br/>
<br/>
I do have one question... Can anyone here in the <br/>
PacNorWest recommend a good book or place that lists the <br/>
trailheads in this state?  A hiker's publication or <br/>
similiar?  I'd like to find places that are 'virgin' and <br/>
set boxes there, though, if some of the people such as <br/>
sunrunner have dropped off, then that opens a large place.<br/>
