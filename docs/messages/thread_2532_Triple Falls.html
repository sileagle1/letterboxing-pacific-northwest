                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kitty and I hiked to Triple Falls yesterday (a *much* easier trek than last <br>
weeks's Wahkeena Spring).  We found the Triple Falls box (part of the <br>
Original Gorge Waterfalls series), and were surprised to see how few people <br>
had stamped in since the log book was replaced a couple of years ago.  It's <br>
such a nice stamp (and piece of PNW letterboxing history, being so old), and <br>
the hike really isn't too bad, and it wasn't terribly hard to find  We wanted to <br>
encourage anyone who hasn't got it to head up there.  The hiding place is the <br>
same as in the clues, but the covering is slightly different (we didn't find it on <br>
first attempt.  I had to keep at it for a few minutes.)<br>
<br>
We also planted the first of a new series in the same general vicinity, in an <br>
area just crying for a box.  We're calling the series Edible Forest, and this box <br>
is devoted to Wood Sorrel.<br>
<br>
And rain or not, this is such a glorious time to go hiking in the Gorge.  The <br>
wildflowers are in full bloom, and the sights and smells are heavenly.  (And <br>
when you've under the heavy forest canopy, very little rain makes it to the <br>
floor!)<br>
