    I'd like to take a moment to thank each and everyone of you that has<br/>
contacted me during the past week concerning RayvenMom's stay in the<br/>
hospital.  For those of you who didn't know, she went into the hospital for<br/>
Laparoscopic Anti-Reflux Surgery, which is fairly easy and common surgery.<br/>
During the surgery, and I am to thankful that the doctor was a very good<br/>
doctor, there was a bleeder in her abdomen.  They were unable to locate it,<br/>
and had it not been discovered, she may have very well bled out after the<br/>
surgery.  As it was, the 4 small incisions were not enough for them to<br/>
repair the bleeder and they had to cut her abdomen open to locate, and stop,<br/>
the bleeder.<br/>
<br/>
    She is resting and will be coming home either today or tomorrow,<br/>
depending and again, I would like to thank everyone for their caring words<br/>
and support during this.<br/>
