                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today we checked our Lorikeet box at the zoo and found its lid <br>
missing and the log full, a couple of resourceful boxers had added <br>
scraps of paper in to log their finds, including one family today!<br>
<br>
We'll get it back in place as soon as we can.<br>
<br>
We also found Trefoils, Tribute, and Here's Looking at You Kid HH <br>
today. Both boxes and the HH in good shape.<br>
