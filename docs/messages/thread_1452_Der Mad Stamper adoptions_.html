                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
About a year ago I asked if there were any letterboxers out there that<br/>
would be willing to adopt Der Mad Stamper's letterboxes within<br/>
Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation District.  One person stepped<br/>
forward, adopting "Cedar Hills Twins" and "Hyland Forest", and<br/>
retiring "Fanno Creek Greenway."  Thanks Mudstumpers!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there's a few left that need attention.  I know that<br/>
Rock Creek #1 has been retired, but I was unable to find Rock Creek #3<br/>
or #4, one of the "Troll and the Dragon" letterboxes, or "Bronson<br/>
Creek Letterbox" ("The Dragon," was located in an area frequented by<br/>
drinkers, people doing drugs, etc., and should be moved to a more<br/>
appropriate location).  NOTE: ROCK CREEK #2 HAS A WASP NEST NEXT TO IT<br/>
AND SHOULD NOT BE APPROACHED.<br/>
<br/>
Another box, "The Lost Letterbox," is in good condition, but will need<br/>
adoption too.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember that, at the Cornelius Pass Roadhouse Letterboxing<br/>
get-together about a year ago, I asked the letterboxing community to<br/>
be proactive in their letterboxing fun.  All letterboxes must be<br/>
maintained by the person(s) that placed the box.  When I monitor the<br/>
letterboxes, the first thing I think about is the safety of the<br/>
letterboxers, followed by attention to the impacts to the natural<br/>
areas.  These last two things are very important for the continued fun<br/>
of letterboxing in District parks.<br/>
<br/>
I also asked that letterboxers contact me ahead of time about new<br/>
boxes so that we can coordinate on placement.  We have dozens of<br/>
restoration projects that go on in District parks each year and I will<br/>
try and contact letterbox owners prior to such projects to make sure<br/>
the boxes aren't disturbed as part of the restoration work.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anybody else out there that would like to adopt Der Mad<br/>
Stamper's letterboxes?  If I don't get any 'takers,' I'll be forced to<br/>
request that the unadopted boxes in District parks be removed from the<br/>
list of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.  Thank<br/>
you for your support and cooperation.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with Brett completely thought, Kyle has been great about working<br/>
with us and been very cooperative.  I would also encourage someone to step<br/>
up and volunteer. Not to mention that since these are Der Mad Stamper boxes,<br/>
we also need to keep in mind that we are preserving a little bit of<br/>
letterboxing history by doing this.  Der Man Stamper and Tom Chaney from my<br/>
understanding are the Pioneers of letterboxing in the Pacific Northwest<br/>
area; let's try to keep his stuff around just in case he ever desires to<br/>
return to this wonderful hobby eh?<br/>

Hi Kyle,<br/>
<br/>
I  placed Rock Creek #1 and #2.  The other two boxes in that <br/>
immediate vicinity have been missiing for some time.  That <br/>
particular patch of woods doesn't get much activity other than <br/>
teen/ pre-teen kids.  It certainly hasn't seen any district projects in <br/>
the 9 years I have lived here!<br/>
<br/>
I know that Mitch didn't want to replace his "Coon's Cache box for <br/>
that reason, and I probably won't replace my "Possum's <br/>
Penthouse" because the penthouse is no more!  Although I am <br/>
not a big fan of "copying" someone else's idea/clue/stamp,  I <br/>
would be happy to replace the Dragon and/or Troll boxes with my <br/>
own.  I agree with your assesment of the Dragon box.  It's <br/>
location was fairly tenuous.  The troll MIGHT survive &amp; it was a <br/>
good spot...  although, I don't believe it actually resides on <br/>
THPRD property, so your concerns might not need be official, <br/>
and more just be cause you are a letterboxer who happens to be <br/>
"on the job." <br/>
<br/>
Let me know how I can help.  I'm meeting with the Ranger at the <br/>
THPRD Nature Park next week to replace a couple of wayward <br/>
boxes.  Since I have a THPRD theme going, I could do a little <br/>
more carving.  Lord knows I've got rubbermaid containers <br/>
stacking up waiting to be letterboxes.<br/>
