Happy Mom and Nailhead just placed a new box at Miller's Sylvania near<br/>
Tumwater, WA called Moondance.  <br/>
<br/>
This box was inspired by the song Moondance by Van Morrison. This box<br/>
will only be available during the month of October as we plan to<br/>
remove it at the end of the month and replace it in another location<br/>
next October.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you are planning to attend the FF2 later this month, be sure<br/>
to check out the clues on the letterboxing.org website.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the dance!<br/>
