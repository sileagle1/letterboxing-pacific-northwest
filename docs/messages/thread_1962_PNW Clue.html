A special thank you to all that attended all 30 of you! We filled the<br>
banquet room at Wall Street Pizza with lots of laughter and plenty of fun. <br>
 <br>
We were having so much fun we outlasted our reservation, so we moved down<br>
the street two blocks to Main Street Park where we enjoyed not only each<br>
others company, but also the gorgeous weather. Several people left from<br>
there to find some of the many local boxes. I can't wait to hear which ones<br>
were found. I personally went and checked on Mother May I, and yes the first<br>
box is still in place. <br>
 <br>
I'll be posting pictures of the fun at www.lbworld.org throughout the day<br>
today. <br>
 <br>
Again, thank you to my family, Pupp and Jenn, Natalie, Cherokee, J Man, Team<br>
Ravynhaus, Bookworm, Camp Fire Lady, David from Beaverton, Der Mad Stamper,<br>
the J Rock Family, Erfellie, Sandy, MiniLes, Bethany and family, Old Vet,<br>
Quilting Noni, Gramma Star, and Touche Turtle for making this so much fun!<br>
