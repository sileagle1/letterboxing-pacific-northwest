&gt; &gt; Don't blame me, blame the forest fires! This was on the list during<br/>
&gt; &gt; the hike from Timberline to the Columbia (with Funhog and Green<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tortuga) but the trail was closed! So we had to make do with beer<br/>
&gt; &gt; and ice cream at Lost Lake instead.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; There seems to be a lot of mystery boxes out there not being<br/>
&gt; &gt; found. Mensa 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has not been found in over a year and Mensa 3 has never been <br/>
&gt; found.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it has to do with the number of boxes we have in the<br/>

not have survived such trials &amp; tribulations.  However it did seem like a<br/>
fairly secure spot, so it is probably OK.  If anyone does head that way,<br/>
don't forget that you can also look for Green Tortuga's McNeil Point box<br/>
when you're in the area.  (There currently seems to be a problem with the<br/>
link to the photo in his clue, but just delete the last 3 characters in the<br/>
URL and you can get to it.)<br/>

We're not up for backpacking (prefer to travel light), but are still<br/>
considering a trip to Olalie Lake.  We've heard good things about the hiking<br/>
&amp; boxing there from a few of you.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't blame me, blame the forest fires! This was on the list <br/>
during<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the hike from Timberline to the Columbia (with Funhog and Green<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tortuga) but the trail was closed! So we had to make do with <br/>
beer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and ice cream at Lost Lake instead.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, and then there is my "Mountain Tourists" box that I <br/>
placed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Oregon<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in SEP 2005 that I've never heard anyone finding yet... Guess<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there aren't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many people that want to do much of a hike either!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There seems to be a lot of mystery boxes out there not being<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; found. Mensa 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has not been found in over a year and Mensa 3 has never been <br/>
&gt; &gt; found.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it has to do with the number of boxes we have in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Portland Metro<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; area. There are so many straight forward boxes that less <br/>
people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time to solve the harder ones. :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is a random message: I checked on this one yesterday <br/>
and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noone has found this one in over a year. The good news is <br/>
that so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; far<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; none of the finders have taken the first finders award yet.<br/>
