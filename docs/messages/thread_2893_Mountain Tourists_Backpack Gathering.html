                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like some exciting times out there in the past 2 years!  My box might<br>
not have survived such trials & tribulations.  However it did seem like a<br>
fairly secure spot, so it is probably OK.  If anyone does head that way,<br>
don't forget that you can also look for Green Tortuga's McNeil Point box<br>
when you're in the area.  (There currently seems to be a problem with the<br>
link to the photo in his clue, but just delete the last 3 characters in the<br>
URL and you can get to it.)<br>
<br>
We're not up for backpacking (prefer to travel light), but are still<br>
considering a trip to Olalie Lake.  We've heard good things about the hiking<br>
& boxing there from a few of you.<br>
