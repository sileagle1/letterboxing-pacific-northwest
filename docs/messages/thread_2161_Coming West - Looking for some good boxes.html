<br>
I am headed tot he Seattle area from Philadelphia in late August, and<br>
was wondering if I could get a heads up on some good boxes to hunt for<br>
my single day of galivanting about the area.<br>
<br>
I expect to be boxing from dawn to dusk on Sunday, August 21, and am<br>
really looking for some quality over quantity. Some nice hikes that<br>
are not too long, with some nice stamps. There seem to be a ton of<br>
boxes in the Seattle area, so suggestions would be very welcome.<br>
<br>
Also, if anyone would like to meet up for exchanges, that would be<br>
great too.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
