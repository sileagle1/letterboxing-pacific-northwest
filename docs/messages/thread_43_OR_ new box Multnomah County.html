Placed by: Wild Woman<br>
Number of boxes: 1<br>
Date: April 5, 2003<br>
City: Portland<br>
County: Multnomah<br>
State: OR<br>
LbNA regional page URL:<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/or/or_pdx.htm<br>
<br>
<br>
Directions: Wallace Books is located at 7241 SE Milwaukie Ave.,<br>
Portland (in Sellwood/Moreland).  It is not open on Mondays.  You can call <br>
for hours: 503-235-7350.<br>
<br>
I’ll get to the clues in a minute, but first a brief rant about the value of <br>
independent bookstores, like Wallace Books:  One of the many reasons not to <br>
buy your books from a chain bookstore (Barnes & Noble, Waldenbooks, etc.) is <br>
that publishers pay the chains to promote their books. This means that a <br>
great book by a little publisher can languish on a bottom shelf somewhere in <br>
a chain store (if they include it in their inventory at all), while a lousy <br>
book gets top shelf or center-table billing because it was published by a big <br>
house able to buy that promotion.  <br>
<br>
Independent booksellers, on the other hand, promote the books they love and <br>
think that you might love, too. Supporting independents = a greater variety <br>
of books and a greater diversity of authors.<br>
<br>
So look up the answers to the clues for this box on a chain’s website if you <br>
want—but buy independent!  Okay *hopping down from my soapbox* here’s what <br>
you need to know to find the box:<br>
<br>
The letterbox is a book.  You’ll have to puzzle out the title of the book, <br>
but it is located on a Pacific Northwest Authors shelf, on an eastern <br>
wall--the third shelf down. <br>
<br>
Fill in the blanks of these PNW authors and their books to learn the title of <br>
the letterbox book:<br>

The owner of the store knows about this letterbox, but for privacy while <br>
stamping in, you could duck into the bathroom (through the Mystery Room.)<br>

(From Wallace Books, you’re quite close to Oaks Bottom Wetland, where these <br>
boxes await your arrival: Nature Book 1, Oaks Bottom, and the Bike Route.)<br>

As for the soapbox speech, that was really nice, but if I owned a <br>
bookstore, doesn't it make more sense to put the books out front that <br>
are most likely to sell well?  <br>
<br>
Yeah, putting out the books they think people will enjoy the most is <br>
very noble--don't get me wrong!  But I've loved books that others <br>
hate and vice-versa, and rather than try to push my likes onto <br>
everyone else, from a business standpoint, I think I'd promote the <br>
books I think would most likely sell.  Which may not be MY favorites, <br>
but perhaps they would be somebody's favorite and I'd get more sales <br>
that way.  That would be the theory, at least.  I've never had a <br>
chance to try it out.  =)<br>
<br>
Actually, come to think of it, if I owned a bookstore, I'd pick the <br>
books I think would sell the best, go to the publisher of that book, <br>
and see if I can get them to give me money to "promote" their book, <br>
which I had every intention of doing anyhow since I had already <br>
concluded that they'd be the easiest to sell in the first place.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, I'm so business-like I should be shot.  Fortunately for <br>
the rest of you, I'm not really a businessman.  =)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some books (most?) become bestsellers BECAUSE of the paid promotion they <br>
receive.  It's true that they'd better live up to the hype, or the author's <br>
next book is unlikely to sell as well.  But meanwhile, a little gem can be <br>
ignored, and die an ignoble death ("remainders") because its publisher can't <br>
afford the publicity it deserves.  IF enough critics applaud it, people may <br>
seek it out in the store--and if enough people do that, then sure, the chain <br>
will happily jump on that bandwagon.  <br>
<br>
But a person who's just browsing is likely to be drawn to those nice, <br>
paid-for displays.<br>
<br>
Barbara Kingsolver, to name one author, says she owes her success to <br>
independent booksellers.  They were the ones who promoted her first <br>
books--the owners read 'em and recommended them to their patrons--the chains <br>
didn't promote them at first.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, in this time of publishing-house mergers, fewer and fewer <br>
large publishers are willing to take chances on quirky books, or books that <br>
interest a (relatively) small audience.  <br>
<br>
So buy independent, Ryan! <br>

Come to think of it, you can get an idea of the kinds of places I <br>
like to hang out at, because I tend to hide letterboxes there.  <br>
Included such beloved places as Leons Used Bookstore.  I love that <br>
place.  *sniffle*  I'm gonna miss it while on the AT.<br>
<br>
And that Where's Jack? letterbox.... themed around one of my favorite <br>
fast food establishments.  =)  Run For the Border themed around <br>
another favorite.  And the large number of letterboxes I've hidden in <br>
the Columbia River Gorge--probably more of my letterboxes are located <br>
in that place than anywhere else for no other reason than it's <br>
probably my most favorite place to hike.  <br>
<br>
And so on.  You can learn a lot about a person by the letterboxes <br>
they hide.  I wonder what the Crappy Stamp letterbox says about me, <br>
then...  Hmmm....  =)<br>

There's a *reason* I don't have to work at the moment--because <br>
I'm frugal!  =)  Be that as it may, I'm quickly running out of money, <br>
despite frugalness, and it looks like within twelves months I'll have <br>
to search for a J-O-B.  *sobbing*<br>
