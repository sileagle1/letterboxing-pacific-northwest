                    <div class="plaintext-content">Having heard on the radio last Wednesday that all reserved campsites <br>
in the Oregon State Parks system were full for the Memorial Day <br>
weekend, I proceded to call the reservation hotline anyway, and <br>
managed to secure the prime dates of  Thursday, Friday and Saturday <br>
nights at Fort Stevens State Park with no problem.  Exactly the <br>
nights we wanted, exactly the park we wanted, and got a site with <br>
electrical hookup too.  (Compact space heater for the tent, griddle <br>
and coffee pot, and we were happy).  <br>
<br>
Clamming was not the best, but not the worst either.  Fortunately, <br>
after getting near to our limits each morning, there was plenty of <br>
time the rest of the day for boxing!  <br>
<br>
Amazingly, each time I found a box, the rain had stopped.  Nary a <br>
drop of water got on a logbook.  Between this and getting the <br>
reservations we wanted at the last minute, I really should have <br>
bought a lottery ticket.<br>
<br>
Here is the rundown on boxes that we found in the county:<br>
<br>
Sunset -- dry, plenty of room in logbook, well-hidden.<br>
Horsin Around -- also in excellent condition<br>
Ecola -- logbook nearing full, is located with the geocache<br>
Heritage Spruce -- well-hidden, dry, plenty of room in logbook<br>
Northwest Oregon -- ditto<br>
Dedicated -- dry, log book nearing full<br>
Battery 245 -- very good hide.  Dry, plenty of room in log.<br>
Fort Clatsop -- dry, log nearing full<br>
HIJMS Submarine I-25 -- ditto<br>
<br>
I was VERY impressed with the quality of the stamps I found -- among <br>
the best I've seen.  The owners will be glad to know that every <br>
single box I found was dry and sound.  Thanks to all of them for <br>
great carvings and thoughtful placements.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also had a lovely weekend at the Oregon Coast, though much further south, <br>
and planned much further in advance.  We based out of Waldport KOA and had <br>
an absolutely beautiful, though wet, set of days boxing.  Wish I could have <br>
gotten to more of them, but we'll definitely go back.  It was an interesting <br>
tally of rescues, replenishments, and odd circumstances.  Seems good to list <br>
them here, since it will be a while before I can get all the finds listed <br>
and the owners contacted.  Here's our tally.<br>
<br>
Yahoo!  Kernville - funny box in an interesting place with great birding <br>
views into the adjacent protected area.  Wish we'd had more duct tape, as <br>
it's peeling off the box.<br>
<br>
Beneath the Blue #3 by Funhog - AWESOME box and a lovely few hours spent at <br>
Cape Meares<br>
<br>
We also looked for the Cape Meares one by Birder, and it was listed as <br>
possibly missing.  We also were unable to find it.<br>
<br>
D-Lake by Rat Pac - cutest little tiny park and a stamp that reminded Legend <br>
of her favorite childhood story.<br>
<br>
Boiler Bay by Hedgehog - log book was soaking wet, so we left a new one and <br>
brought the old one home for drying out.<br>
<br>
Cape Lookout by Birder/Calli K - We definitely need to come back here.  This <br>
was a fun box in a gorgeous area.<br>
<br>
Also looked for the one on the Cape Lookout trail by the Rat Pac.  Didn't <br>
find it, but I'm sure it was because of us.  We were so taken away by the <br>
scenery that we couldn't find the right landmarks.<br>
<br>
Darlingtonia Californica - I couldn't believe how interesting this little <br>
park was.  Thanks so much Pungent Bob for the suggestion to go there.  The <br>
log book was soaking wet, and there was a pink rubber ball in the container. <br>
That didn't seem like a good sign, but the stamp was still there.  We left a <br>
new log book, took the wet one home to dry out, and buried the box a little <br>
deeper in the duff in hopes the Geocachers don't find it again.  The clue <br>
says it's under the end of the log.  We found it under a piece of bark on <br>
bare ground next to the log.<br>
<br>
Heceta Head by Green Tortuga - in great shape.  Logbook was full.  We left <br>
another one, and also left the original there.  So gorgeous.<br>
<br>
Hobbit Trilogy by Heron A Foot- we had time to find 2 of the 3 before it got <br>
dark.  Such a gorgeous hike (is there an echo in here?)<br>
<br>
Chris the Crab at Cape Foulweather - such a gorgeous (ous ous ous ooouus) <br>
hike (ike ike ike iiiike), and we were glad to enjoy it on the one nice, <br>
sunny day of the weekend.<br>
<br>
Beneath the Blue #1 by Funhog - this (and the Hobbit Trail) were the two <br>
non-negotiable hikes I had on my list the entire weekend.  We were running <br>
so late when we got there, but I insisted we go.  We thoroughly enjoyed way <br>
too much time on this hike, and the consequence was that we missed the last <br>
ferry onto the island and had to drive around, so I got home at 4am this <br>
morning, and dude, I am SO tired.  But it was memorable, and thanks so much <br>
Funhog for the trip.  The log book was nearly full.  I left a new one and <br>
left the old one there because I know you like to leave the old logs in <br>
place for people to read.<br>
<br>
Drift"wood" Falls by WildHair - also a wonderful box in a great hiding spot <br>
at a lovely rest in the trail.  Also full log book (1 page left) so we left <br>
another log book.  Left the old one in place.<br>
<br>
Strawberry Hill Wayside - I actually found this one last year, but just <br>
checked on it to see how it was.  Good thing I did.  The box had a missing <br>
lid, was wrapped in leaky bags, and the log book was completely soaked.  We <br>
gave it a new plastic box, new baggies, and a new log book, and brought the <br>
old one home for drying.<br>
<br>
Good thing we visited the very interesting Marine Science Center in Newport. <br>
Such a great thing to do on a rainy day.  They had these intersting little <br>
"Boku" books for $1.25 each.  We bought a handful and used nearly every one <br>
replacing wet and full log books.  Great find!<br>
<br>
Thanks everybody for the wonderful weekend.<br>
