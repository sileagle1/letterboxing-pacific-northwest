Hi! I was just wondering if anyone is traveling to Bandon, OR in the <br/>
near future if they might pick up my Seafarers Friend Letterbox. I <br/>
put it out on a jetty, which wasn't a good idea apparently (duh) and <br/>
some extremely generous person was nice enough to send me my logbook <br/>
back since it was in very bad condition, but I thought that if anyone <br/>
could pick up the box I will be happy to reimburse shipping costs. <br/>
Thank you! :o)<br/>
