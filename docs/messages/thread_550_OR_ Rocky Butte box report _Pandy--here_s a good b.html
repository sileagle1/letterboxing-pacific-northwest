                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we were planning to try for Doyle Owl--again!--but Rocky Butte lured us <br>
in instead.  It's embarrassing to admit that neither Heather or I had ever <br>
been there before.  We said very nice things about Funhog and her choices of <br>
venues as we climbed the steps (to make up for the bad things we said while <br>
following the wrong rings of time in pursuit of Doyle Owl! ;o).  In fact, Wild <br>
Child was so thrilled with what she called "a castle," she suggested she'd like to <br>
have the Hawg for a mother (so much for my years of diaper changes, sickbed <br>
ministrations & help with homework)! And the kids also loved the entrance to <br>
the trail--those steps closed in by stone & vegetation that could lead into any <br>
adventure!  I'm happy to report that the box is still alive & well & now <br>
bolstered with our signature stamps.  It's getting toward the end of the logbook, <br>
tho there are still some pages for more stamps.<br>
<br>
After stamping in, we returned to the "castle" to watch the sun set--the kids <br>
shouted and turned cartwheels, while young lovers smooched near various <br>
lamposts (cynical Heather & I muttering under our breath that the smoochers should <br>
check out our group--if they keep at it, WE ARE THEIR FUTURE!).   All in all, <br>
a lovely evening--fun clues to a fun place--thanks to a Funhog for the trip!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the heads up Wild Woman <br>
I will put this one on my list of things to do with Sim Kitty.<br>
<br>
BTW I am wanting to take Sim Kitty and Iron`Bear back to the Box in a <br>
Box set at the college. But we were so frustrated that we could not <br>
find the starting point last time I am not sure I can get them to go <br>
back there.  Would you be so kind as to give me a nudge in the right <br>
direction so that I might lure them back with more information. I <br>
have heard great things about the box and while I am willing to hunt <br>
and search for myself, with Sim Kitty along we were looking for <br>
something a little easier.<br>
<br>
Thanks a ton!<br>
