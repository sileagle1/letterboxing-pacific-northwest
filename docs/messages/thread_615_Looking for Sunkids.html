I'm brand new to letterboxing as I chanced upon a box a few weeks <br/>
back. I didn't look through the box, only picked up the flyer <br/>
regarding letterboxing. After reading through it and going online to <br/>
learn more...I became hooked without even starting yet. I looked for <br/>
clues to the box I had found on the national site and didn't find <br/>
any. I'm wondering if this wonderful box is known by others?<br/>
<br/>
I went back to the letterbox I'd found and made my mark, picked up <br/>
one of the postcards from the box to send out to the Sunkids to <br/>
inform them of the condition of the box. "Still really good by the <br/>
way!!!" What I did notice is that the postcards had 33 cent stamps on <br/>
them. That tells me that the box is about 2-3 years old. Are the <br/>
Sunkids still around? Do others know about this box? It's in <br/>
Washington State in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest near a <br/>
trailhead within a Federal campground. <br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to do more LBing.<br/>
