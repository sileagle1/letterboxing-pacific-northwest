since we found Multnomah Falls on our second attempt - the first was <br>
in an out of bounds area but very similar/near the actual location. <br>
We moved ourselves out of the newbie catagory!!!<br>
<br>
We have 4 of the 6 at "Murder at Gabriel Park" and will keep going <br>
back.  It's a good excuse for walking the dog there.<br>
<br>
All 4 of Funhog's What's for Dinner" series - very cute, all in good <br>
shape.<br>
<br>
"Inuit Sun" is a beautiful stamp but needs corrected clues, its not <br>
near the Creek or Jay trails.  All finders were persistant enough to <br>
keep looking along the trails.<br>
<br>
Wahkeena Falls - alive and well - we got hailed on! <br>
<br>
Fairy Falls - nice location and in good shape<br>
<br>
Multnomah Falls - doesn't get many visitors - nice spot!!! in good   <br>
shape.<br>
<br>
The "Lucky Lemur" box is nice!  BUT the wooden log has been moved off <br>
the trail we think someone moved the rock too, and the paper log only <br>
has a few pages left.  Everyone loves your pens - where did you get <br>
them?<br>
<br>
"Octopus" Funhog - very nice!! as per Windarien's comments - same <br>
problem (HA! HA!)<br>
<br>
This puts us at P0 F27  Wahoo!<br>
