Okay... I'll be in the greater Portland/Beaverton area on MLK weekend<br>
and hope to do some boxing or maybe even meet up with fellow<br>
letterboxers, time permitting.<br>
<br>
I need some flexibility in meeting up with local letterboxers because <br>
I will be in Portland for a huge dog show that weekend (Fri-Mon)and <br>
my schedule will be dictated by our ring time each morning/early <br>
afternoon and whether or not my dog wins Best Of Breed. If she does <br>
I'm committed to staying at the Portland Metro Convention Center all <br>
day/evening. If she doesn't win then I am free for the rest of the <br>
day.<br>
<br>
I will be in my own car (since I'm driving from Tac/Seattle area) and<br>
able to drive where ever I need to. So if you are local and flexible<br>
with your times I'd love to meet up and box. Email me and we can plan<br>
offlist. I should be able to get away from everything on Friday and<br>
Sunday afternoon easiest.<br>
<br>
So...what are some good, local boxes in the Portland/Beaverton area<br>
where I can do some serious "powerboxing" aka the most boxes in the<br>
least amount of time or clusters of boxes. I am pretty good with<br>
directions/maps and have a basic working knowledge of the Metro<br>
Portland/Beaverton/Hillsboro/Banks area.<br>
<br>
In fact as I think about this...if anyone local to Portland want's to <br>
give a HH/Traveller a lift up to the Tacoma/Seattle area I'd be <br>
willing to take it along with me. If all else fails you can contact <br>
me offlist and if you are willing to come to the dogshow on any of <br>
those days and meet me ringside (could be real early) just after I <br>
get done showing we could exchange stamps and/or HH's. I think I'll <br>
carve up a stamp or two today just for the occasion! Or we could <br>
exchange letterboxes for planting. I'd take your box, plant it up <br>
here and maintain it and you could do likewise for me!! My daughter <br>
is already planning on doing this and I was going to plant a box in <br>
the Greater Banks/Hillsboro/Beaverton area that would be maintained <br>
by my aunt. The box she is doing is to commemorate her birthday which <br>
is that Saturday.<br>
<br>

It's probably true that some people on this talk list don't <br>
subscribe to the big board, but I doubt that if we here on this <br>
regional talk list can't answer any Portland area questions you <br>
have, it's almost certain that nobody on the main talk list will be <br>
able to either!  The only regional players not on this board are <br>
probably either newbies that haven't discovered it yet or those that <br>
don't want to be on any talk list at all.  (Or maybe they don't like <br>
me being the talk list owner?  *grin*  I don't know definitively <br>
that anybody has left this board solely because I'm the owner, but I <br>
suppose it could have happened.)<br>
<br>
Consequently, I'll answer your questions on this board.  Most people <br>
on the main talk list probably don't care.<br>

I headed back and replaced two of the missing boxes, although three <br>
boxes from the series are confirmed missing (by me!) and have yet to <br>
be replaced.  The details of checkup can be found at post 2600: <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW/message/2600<br>
<br>
As for where there are large clusters of letterboxes where you <br>
can "power box", I'd probably focus on Forest Park or MacIver Park.  <br>
There have been gatherings there and a LOT of boxes were placed in <br>
honor of them!  Of course, if you're looking for "quality", you can <br>
try hunting down my Portland Walking Tour letterbox, but you might <br>
not finish in time if you only have a weekend available.  ;o)<br>
