                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  What a GREAT store!  =)  Hiking trails!  Biking trails!  <br>
Interpretive trails!  A waterfall!  And then the store itself.  Very <br>
impressive!  Spent hours today looking around and causing mischief.  <br>
What a great day.  Even picked up an application.  (Put in a good <br>
work for me, Danny.  *wink*)<br>
<br>
Oh, Amanda and I also got the letterbox there to boot.  Sheeze, it's <br>
almost depressing to see Wanda and Pete beating me to west coast <br>
boxes now days.  First in California.  Now Washington.  When will the <br>
madness end?!  =)<br>
<br>
Amanda got tired of waiting for me looking around the store, so I <br>
told her to leave me and I'd walk back to West Seattle.  You know, <br>
that's kind of a lengthy walk....  *rolling eyes*<br>
<br>
Anyhow, great day!  Thanks for the box!  =)  Checkout the store too!  <br>
I bought a book on 'thru-hiking' the Wonderland Trail.  Since thru-<br>
hiking the Pacific Crest Trail isn't happening this year, I figure a <br>
couple of weeks on the 92 mile Wonderland Trail might be a good <br>
choice.  Ho ho ho!<br>
