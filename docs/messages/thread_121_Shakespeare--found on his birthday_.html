                    <div class="plaintext-content">On Wednesday, the drama teacher at the high school where I am <br>
student teaching and I took 12 kids down to Ashland to see three <br>
plays (all of which were excellent!!!)  Before leaving for the trip, <br>
I made sure to print up the Shakespeare LB hints, however, I debated <br>
printing up any other hints, thinking, "I have 12 kids to watch, <br>
I'll never have time to hunt for boxes."  The box that I especially <br>
wanted to find was the Applegate Rest Area box.  Of course, I was <br>
thinking, "There's no way the bus will be pulled over just so that I <br>
can find a box."  So then you can imagine how INCREDIBLY <br>
PSYCHOTICALLY ANGRY I was with myself when everyone on the bus <br>
needed to go to the bathroom when we got to the Applegate Rest <br>
Area!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
I walked around, looking for any places that looked "letterbox-<br>
friendly," however, without the clues, I was S.O.L!<br>
<br>
Anyway, that night at dinner, I explained to the drama teacher, her <br>
friend and 2 of the kids why I had been prowling around random trees <br>
at the rest stop and told them all about letterboxing.  <br>
Enthusiastic, they all decided that they wanted to go find the <br>
Shakespeare box with me, so we set out for adventure.  It took a bit <br>
longer to find than we had expected, so by the time we got back to <br>
the bus to meet the other kids, we were 10 minutes late.  :) The <br>
chaperones were the late ones.  Nice.  :)<br>
<br>
Although I never found the Applegate LB, one good thing sprouted <br>
from this trip (aside from finding the Shakespeare box ON <br>
SHAKESPEARE'S SUPPOSED BIRTHDAY)--once we found the box, one of the <br>
other chaperones was so excited about letterboxing that she went and <br>
bought a notebook and an eraser and carved her own stamp that very <br>
night so that she could go back to next day to put her own mark in <br>
the book!  Yay!!!  A newbie!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry you missed the Applegate, Jess!  I had the opposite experience of <br>
having the clues with me but not being able to stop due to time constraints.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that if you can find a public library in whatever town you find <br>
yourself in, you can retrieve clues (providing they have internet access, of <br>
course).  Heather & I went to the library when we found ourselves clueless in <br>
West Linn.<br>

Great recruiting job, Jess!  Sorry you couldn't get the Applegate box,<br>
but at least you got The Bard!  I have yet to get either of those boxes,<br>
but maybe someday.<br>
