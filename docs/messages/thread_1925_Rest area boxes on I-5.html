Hi everyone! There are a few good rest area boxes along I-5 between <br>
Eugene and Grants Pass but its extremely hard to locate clues for <br>
them on LBNA because the county is under the wrong name. Rambopup <br>
left several of her LBs on a northbound trip, great stamps too, but <br>
so far Sandi and I are the only ones to have found them and they have <br>
been there for quite a while, so if anyone wants directions to find <br>
these LBs, feel free to ask me! Otherwise I fear they will never be <br>
found. I tried to contact Rambopup to update the indo (county names) <br>
but I guess shes not been on the internet for awhile. <br>

Hi there,<br>
<br>
I would love to have the clues for the boxes hidden along I-5!  We will be <br>
thraveling along that way soon.<br>
<br>
Thanks for posting about them.<br>

Hey, we tried to find these four rest-stop letterboxes the other day <br>
and only were successfull with two of them.  The one at Valley of <br>
Rogue was nowhere to be found unless a burrowing animal took it to <br>
parts unknown.  Moon Goddess and Dig Dog were there and we were <br>
completely lost on Baseball Goddess as we never found the 'log' over <br>
which to climb--we tried to look for a box underneath EVERY bent <br>
tree within that stretch of woodland we could find but to no avail.  <br>
We found a spot that looked 'applicable' but no box beneath the <br>
bend. Lots of 'used' TP piles all around. Then, along the 3 hour <br>
subsequent drive home we wondered if perhaps the clues were intended <br>
for the rest stop on the Southbound side of I-5?  Not sure but that <br>
may be the case?  Otherwise, there was a bunch of 'forestry' work <br>
that had occurred on the Northbound side and we're not sure if that <br>
totally changed the environment to the point that the clues no <br>
longer work.  The stamps we did find were awesome--as usual with <br>
Rambopupp's work!!!<br>

As long as you avoided getting poison oak, I'd consider that a huge<br>
success!  =)<br>

;)  Thankfully, it didn't happen this time with the rest area <br>
boxes...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Don't speak too soon--I'm currently fighting yet another 'mother of <br>
all' cases of poison oak--no thanks to the incredible deluge <br>
inspired mass 'bloom' of poison oak on every square inch of the <br>
entire state of California.  Now I remember why I hadn't been back <br>
to CA for 2 years--it was the poison oak!!!  ;)  I guess our next <br>
trip back will be in another two years--just enough time to forget <br>
about the pain and suffering I'm currently enduring.  Yes, you can <br>
blame 3 yo trkr for this case--he just HAD to romp in the stuff!!!<br>
