                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not strictly a letterboxing issue, but this last weekend I ran into 3 <br/>
people doing trail maintenance at Fish Lake Trail in the Olallie Lake <br/>
Scenic Area.  A forest service employee (on his own time) and his son <br/>
and grandson were doing trail maintenance, an exhausting but necessary <br/>
job.  They were cutting out downed trees and diverting the creek that <br/>
insisted upon muddying up a section of the switchback.   The older man <br/>
had neat stories to tell and we swapped info about trails and <br/>
conditions over the last couple years, in the OLSA.  Since hiking has <br/>
always been my first passion (with letterboxing an enthusiastic co-<br/>
activity), this was a great treat to be able to talk to this gentleman <br/>
who is partly responsible for making my hiking in the area more <br/>
enjoyable.  And I think talking to them gave them an excuse to take a <br/>
break for a while...  So I encourage anyone who runs into a work party <br/>
to thank them.  They deserve it!<br/>

In the Olallie Lake area, proper etiquette for thanking the work <br/>
parties is to do so in your wet underwear...<br/>

In a funny coincidence I was helping maintain the Fish Lake rail trail between Spokane and Cheney the weekend before last.  I hope to help with a hiking/mountain biking trail this weekend that leads to the longest hike to a letterbox in the Spokane area (Sunrise at Beacon Hill).<br/>
