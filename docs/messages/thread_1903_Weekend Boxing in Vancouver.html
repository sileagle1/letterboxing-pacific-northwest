                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the update on the boxes, Maiden.  It feels much better to come<br/>
home from Lbing with something to show for it than skunked... especially<br/>
when it's cold out!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the last several weeks adventures in Vancouver. Ladybug, Wood-aug and<br/>
I went out several times.  We replaced some plastic bags and cleaned up some<br/>
boxes but now I can't remember what was done to which boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Found:<br/>
- Report Card - clever!<br/>
- Fort Vancouver - great hide!<br/>
- Bookworm<br/>
- Live to Ride, ride to Live<br/>
- Paradise<br/>
- Corp of Discovery - stopped by to get a color rendering of this neat<br/>
stamp.  Found the lid had a hole in it which turned it into a beetle trap,<br/>
complete with live beetles.  We didn't have a box with us (never thought of<br/>
carrying an extra).  Thankfully the oh-so-appropriate log book is dry and in<br/>
good shape.<br/>
<br/>
Attempts:<br/>
- Maiden's Birthday Series box 1 (is it there? ... maybe they took out the<br/>
tree  ...?)<br/>
- NW Wildlife Series *Bear* - spent lots of energy on this one... only found<br/>
poplars, not aspen trees.  Is it there?<br/>
- Trees where important too.<br/>
<br/>
For those that write directly please note my new email addy.  We finally<br/>
have cable... Woo Hoo, now we're part of the new century!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear about the status of more boxes.  ... and hear if the boxes we<br/>
attempted are there.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
SloMo<br/>

  Saturday the Brat Pack dragged RavynMom out for a day of boxing  . . . . .<br/>
<br/>
   . . . It's been a long time since we've heard about anyone's travels.<br/>
Let's<br/>
  hear what you've found lately.<br/>
