While out in the area I went to find Brown's Camp which according to <br>
lore is Oregon's first letterbox. (DMS - can you confirm/deny this? <br>
Its placement is listed as Oct 98, but you show some of you gorge <br>
boxes as placed in Aug 98.) <br>
<br>
I was quite happy to have finally added this box to my found list but <br>
was somewhat dissapointed that so few have found such a historical <br>
box, I think it was just six finders before me! Head on out to get <br>
this one folks. When, not if, you do, take along a few good baggies, <br>
this box needs a little TLC and my first aid supplies were <br>
unfortunately little low.<br>

<br>
Yeah, but did you find the Dairy Queen up there?! =) Man, I really<br>
wanted one after hiking over from Elks Mountain, I think it was<br>
called, and the register at the top said there was a Dairy Queen at<br>
the top, but I didn't see it. *sniffle* So I stopped at one driving<br>
back to Hillsboro instead. It just wasn't the same, though....<br>
