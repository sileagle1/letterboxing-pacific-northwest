 . . . Funhog, and Heyokahman, too! This box has been on my list to<br/>
find and as a Labor Day event we sought it out. We are fortunate to<br/>
own a canoe and launched from the Portland waterfront on the eastbank,<br/>
where Alder Creek also rents canoes. It was a fabulous day and a good<br/>
work-out for the guys. Greenmonkey and I got to sit back in style!<br/>
(It's a large canoe.)  We had to transpose the clues as we were coming<br/>
from the north, but no worries mate, it was a breeze! Thanks for the<br/>
good time Kuku!!<br/>
<br/>
If others of you are in the Puget Sound area and find this idea of<br/>
boat-boxing intriguing, please visit the box I planted last year<br/>
"Hundred Acre Island":<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=21362<br/>
I've updated the clues with a marine map. When we went there we came<br/>
from the west past Steamboat Island. Lots of jellyfish and seals in<br/>
the water. Super nice trip!!<br/>
<br/>
This is a Washington State Park, and the GoNorthwest website refers to<br/>
it as the Puget Sound's best kept secret. You can pick apples, hike<br/>
the circular trail of the island and enjoy a nice afternoon on the<br/>
beach. Kayak rentals are available at Boston Harbor, just a few miles<br/>
north of Olympia.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails(on land and in water)!! Let me know if you go.<br/>
