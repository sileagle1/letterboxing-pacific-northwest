                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, judging from the relatively few numbers (appx 10 people voting <br/>
so far) of responses to the poll about which day to schedule the <br/>
proposed Portland Gathering, we have narrowed the best weekends down <br/>
to 2:  July 12,13 or Aug 23, 24.  <br/>
<br/>
Now we need to concentrate on which of the 4 days is best.  Before we <br/>
create another poll perhaps we can have some discussion on this?<br/>
<br/>
Comments please.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since those two weekends will get the most people out, how about two<br/>
gatherings?  They both don't have to involve extravagant feasts.  When<br/>
Patrick Delavariensis was visiting, there was a spurofthemoment Super Box<br/>
Sunday gathering.  Thirteen boxers came out to meet Patrick, and a fun time<br/>
was had.  A camping weekend on the 12th and 13th, with all the trimmings,<br/>
and then on the 23rd or 24th a designated time and place to gather without<br/>
the trimmings.  That way those of us who can not make the big one can still<br/>
meet the people behind the stamps.  It's not as if letterboxing was<br/>
something we don't enjoy doing :-)<br/>
