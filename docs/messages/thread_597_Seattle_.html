We chased after the Schmitz Park 3-box series, and our results were as<br/>
follows:<br/>
<br/>
1. Box was in place and intact, but the stamp was gone :-(  It appeared that<br/>
the box had been stumbled across several times; my guess is that someone<br/>
decided it would be a nice heirloom of their trip to the park.<br/>
2. Box, stamp, book all in good shape and well hidden.  Cute squirrel!<br/>
3. We couldn't find box #3.  Time was short, so our search was rather<br/>
cursory, but we found the log that looks like it's sliding down the hill,<br/>
and a significant portion of it had slid down the hill, possibly taking the<br/>
box with it.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the complications, we had a grand day out.  The park is beautiful<br/>
and the smll children at the community centre, where we ate lunch, were<br/>
darling.  I'm not sure why, but they weren't allowed to stand up or they'd<br/>
be assigned cleanup duty.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be hitting Padilla Bay and Bayview soon-I've gotten every Skagit county<br/>
box so far, and I'm not giving up my  stranglehold on this county! :-O<br/>
