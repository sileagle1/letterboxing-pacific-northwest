Yes, folks, for those of you who missed the sadly departed Portland<br>
Walking Tour, it has been replaced and is waiting for visitors!  =) <br>
Please be sure to rehide the box well and check that it's not visible<br>
from *any* direction.  I'm thinking that might be the reason it went<br>
missing the first time.<br>
<br>
In other news....  I went to try finding ESP but came up empty handed.<br>
 I'm pretty sure I was at the right column and searched behind all the<br>
big rocks, but there's lots of nook and crannies out there.  Anyone<br>
know about it's recent status?  =)<br>
<br>
Farewell!<br>
