                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, thanks to everyone who supported me in 2008 for the Washington Trails Association hike-a-thon. We raised over $1600 for Washington Trails! Ryan and I did some trail work this year at Mt. Rainier for Earth Day and we saw first hand the amazing things that WTA accomplishes by rebuilding and repairing the trails every season.<br>
<br>
As usual, I will be hiking during the entire month of August, I hope to get in at least 50 miles. I am seeking pledges for my hiking. You can pledge a flat donation, such as $50 or an amount per mile, such as $1 per mile.  Any contributions over $35 will be eligible for Washington Trails Association Membership. (With membership you receive a Washington Trails Magazine) and all donations are tax deductible.  Every little bit helps!  Last year I had pledges as low as 10 cents per mile or a flat $3. It all adds up. Just to let you know what your dollars can accomplish, WTA sent me a breakdown of how they use the money.<br>
<br>
$25-$99 Can provide treats for a team of volunteers<br>
$100-$249 Can Outfit a crew in hardhats<br>
$250-$499 WTA can purchase 5 or more new trail tools<br>
$500-$749 WTA can lead 1 annual maintenance trip on a popular trail<br>
$750-$999 WTA can lead two rehabilitation work parties<br>
$1,000+ WTA can restore 1 mile (or more) of backcountry trail <br>
<br>
I will have a blog up on the internet detailing my hiking and pledges, as well as a web page on the WTA website.<br>

<br>
I will need to collect all money from my pledges by September 3, 2009.  If you do not want to make a pledge by credit card to the website, checks can be made out to WTA (Washington Trails Association) and mailed to me and cash is always welcome.<br>
<br>
And for those folks in the Seattle area...if you would like to come out with me and hike...I will be hiking in and around the Puget Sound area on August 3rd, 5th, 7th, 15th, 17th and 22nd. If you would like to come along to Cougar Mountain or Deception Pass or Twin Falls etc Drop me a line and let me know! The more the merrier!!<br>
<br>
Thanks so much, <br>
