firstie.  I never knew we had a set of boxes right next door to our <br/>
house.  Thanks to Bookworm and her lovely boxes planted at Orchards <br/>
Park in Vancouver we were there first.  We have our firstie prize <br/>
already pasted in our log books.  We had a bit of the Pharoh's curse <br/>
on the 3rd box though.  But with help from the Bookworm we figured <br/>
it out.  Think outside the box is all I can say.  I learned my <br/>
lesson while hunting, when you can't find it think of all possible <br/>
solutions to the puzzle.  What we think is the way is not the way <br/>
the placer thinks by no means. I love Egyptian stuff to boot also.  <br/>
Thanks to Bookworm for the challenge.  Willow,Daisy and <br/>
Heartsey.     <br/>
