<br/>
Pt Defiance has plenty of space left.  With the great vistas, and the <br/>
trail network there are several themes that can work.  There are <br/>
still places to take the visitor and certainly some chances for <br/>
diabolical hard cluesmanship and vexing series ( hint hint).<br/>
<br/>
Bridle Trails is at saturation.  I feel there is just not enough <br/>
there to support going to a different area of the park.  Done what is <br/>
there, seen what is there, you have pretty much done it all.  My aim <br/>
was to present basic boxing skills and introduce to park to non-<br/>
horsepeople.<br/>
<br/>
Rattlesnake Ridge is a real destination box.  I can't see the point <br/>
of there being another box between the road and the ultimate box as <br/>
there is only one trail option.  Why bother?  (I have to go back up <br/>
and replace the log book and stamp.)<br/>
<br/>
I did hear someone musing about using it as a start for a 10+ mile <br/>
quest for multiple boxes.  westerly toward the winery?  That would <br/>
certainly be a good venture.  It would require 2 cars or some very <br/>
sturdy legs.  i like the idea of a series that challenging.<br/>
<br/>
There are many areas of the state being neglected, such as cascade <br/>
crest and eastern WA.  I set one in eastern WA to compliment one <br/>
placed by Fudrick.  A person could visit 2 different venues within 15 <br/>
miles of each other and have 2 different experiences ( riparian vs <br/>
upland grass zone).  I am pondering a third directly in the opposite <br/>
direction.  This would give a third totally different experience, a <br/>
pine forest all within 30 miles.  <br/>
<br/>
Tiger Mountain is lonely but nearby Cougar has several and could <br/>
likely use more.<br/>
<br/>
Larabee SP could support more but those that are there are not <br/>
getting visited enough ( another hint hint)<br/>
<br/>
I like series that have a theme or try to teach me something, such as <br/>
compass exercise.<br/>
