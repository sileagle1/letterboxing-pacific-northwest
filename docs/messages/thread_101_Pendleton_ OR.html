Yippee-I'm driving from Idaho to Seattle Friday and plan to get the <br>
Pendleton Letterbox along the way.  We stopped in Pendleton over <br>
Thanksgiving to check out the fine wools, but I didn't know there was <br>
a box there til we got home.  I wanted to plant one there so I'm glad <br>
you did.  =-)  <br>
<br>
Also thanks for finding my NM box.  I'm so addicted to this sport, of <br>
course I don't think I spend as much time as my sister.  =-)<br>
<br>
Thanks again.<br>
