been trying to check up on at least one of my planted boxes each weekend...<br/>
just to make sure they were still in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
We found the Three Firs box in great shape.. wonderful site as well! Tooth<br/>
Fairy finally found it's home after I'd be wandering around for ten minutes<br/>
searching every log on the hill side.<br/>
<br/>
Then we checked up on my Felize Navidad box... we found it to be in good<br/>
shape but lonely.. only two people had been to visit it... and both of those<br/>
were in the last 3 weeks.<br/>

3... Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
We Updated the boxes -- had to "Replace" #'s 1 &amp; 3 -- Tho it's a "carved<br/>
by Twilight" rather than a "carved by Mischief" in position #1 at this<br/>
point :&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
So -- as of 5:15pm, all 3 boxes are alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
We were amused to find the only box that had made it thru the year was<br/>
my daughter's -- and the log book was full (our first one), so we<br/>
replced that, but all else was in fine condition.<br/>
<br/>
It's a very little hike, but fun none the less.  They've regraded the<br/>
path and it's almost stroller worthy -- it would be totally, but there's<br/>
one 7-stair climb that technically makes it only "almost" :).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

I have looked for this box unsuccessfully. I am far from fluent in<br/>
Spanish and I have <br/>
found that parts of this clue don't make a great deal of sense to me. In<br/>
fact, one line <br/>
has a lonely Engish adjective in the clue which has no noun to modify. I<br/>
have <br/>
consulted several online translators and a Spanish speaking friend with<br/>
no success. I <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are having the same problem with Frenchie Falls.  Even our French friend was a bit confused by one of the phrases.  Linguistics is not an exact science nor is language ever interpreted the same by any 2 people, I know, it was my BA.    <br/>
<br/>
We are giving up on Pony Tail Falls, Saturday we must have checked every rock and boulder and fern up there.  However, the Triple Falls box is is fine shape - still 3 pages left.  We will replace the log book on our next visit.  If you are planning to go up anytime soon, there are lots of new hazards on the trail.  Several mudslides took out trees and rocks and the 3rd bridge (above the trail junction with TR400) was destroyed.  There are also several major drifts still blocking the trails (about 6 feet high)  and would not be appropriate for children - there were some dogs out but several were being carried over/across them.  Most people found the trail impassible beyond Triple Falls.  They said the drifts were too deep and unstable.  We had hot soup and coffee near the bridge and didn't attempt going beyond the letterbox.  We were content to sit and hear the water roar.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it was a glorious day!  <br/>
<br/>
We finally found a perfect day at the Zoo, Sunday, no crowds and nice weather.  We were successful with all 3 boxes listed. Great hide for Packy!  Winking Eagle was almost visible, we took care of that, and Wapiti was fine.   My 3 year old nephew even gave me a ride in his wagon!<br/>
<br/>
Friday we found the 2nd Annual Thanksgiving box.  Nice stamp and great location!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone for all the fun locations!<br/>

You're absolutely right in that parts of it when translated make no sense.<br/>
It was kind of funny... I wrote out the clues, translated them via one of<br/>
the online translators, then translated it back... it was all goofed up.<br/>
BUT I figured there were enough clear details to get people there.  A friend<br/>
of mine speaks Spanish as her first language and when I had her read it..<br/>
she just shook her head at me.<br/>
<br/>
Two people have found it, I'll email them and get some feedback.  If it's<br/>
too difficult or if they had to go to huge efforts to find it, I'll make<br/>
some changes.<br/>
