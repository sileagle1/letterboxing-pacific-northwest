we traveled up to Olympia today and tried for two boxes in the pourding<br/>
rain.  The patriot box was not there.  I found the right location but no<br/>
box.  We then headed over for Hedwige's Journal.  My 4 year old son and I<br/>
had a great time playing James. Bond.  Senate was in session so there were<br/>
State Troopers crawling all over the capital.  A set in full riot gear were<br/>
going in the exact path to the box.  We stood around looking at statues<br/>
trying to look inconspicous while we waited for them to leave so we could<br/>
get down there.  We did in fact get it without being spotted andn got it<br/>
returned with no problem.  Very cute stamp. We made a few other stops and<br/>
dropped off a Candid Camera in one of them. That thing sure has a tricky<br/>
button.. it goes off at the most inopprotune moments ;)<br/>
