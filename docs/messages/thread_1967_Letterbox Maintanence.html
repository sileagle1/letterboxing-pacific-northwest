So yesterday I set out to collect several of my LB's close to home <br>
for some maintanence, They will be re-hidden today in very nice <br>
looking camoflauged rubber-maid containers, I dont know why I didnt <br>
think of the camo sooner considering how often I find LBs hiding <br>
spots and its like "Oh gee there it is, out in the open, bright blue <br>
lid, Im suprised no one has taken it yet" because I am sure in the <br>
wind and rain and such our leaves and bark and debris we put on top <br>
of the boxes gets removed,  but anyways, that wasnt my point haha I <br>
grabbed my "endangered wildlife" LB, which was the first I ever <br>
planted, and now that I look at it after 2 years of letterboxing, <br>
gee.. I am kind of embarassed to put it back out there in the wild. <br>
Its just sooo..uumm...beginner level crappy stamp haha and the log <br>
book is atrocious. I guess as I have learned to carve better and do <br>
better logbooks, this letterbox just looks ridiculously kindergarten <br>
style to me now haha :o) but dont let that stop all you treasure <br>
seekers out there from locating it :o) just dont think "Erfellie must <br>
be really lame" when you find it haha :o) <br>
