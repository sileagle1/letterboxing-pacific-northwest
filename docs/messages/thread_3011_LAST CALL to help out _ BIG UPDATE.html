                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for everyone who has bought raffle tickets already. This is more than a raffle, it's an opportunity to help us out during our financial storm - primarily medical, read full story here.<br>
<br>
In addition to helping us out, you get the opportunity to win one (or more) of my many stamps that have been sitting around.<br>
<br>
:::::::HUGE UPDATE!!!::::::::<br>
<br>
Maude, who I consider to be one of the best carvers in the nation, has graciously and generously donated 6 of her incredible stamps. To top this off, she has created a logbook for each stamp, and a note explaining why she carved the stamp.<br>
<br>
Each and every stamp/logbook combo would be wonderful to win. Thank you Maude for your kindness in helping us out.<br>
<br>
::::::ANOTHER UPDATE:::::::<br>
<br>
A couple days ago I received an Email from Seattle Bound offering a "set of LTC's and a few stamps." The set "would almost complete set of LTC's of mine. There would only be one or two missing from it."<br>
<br>
Seattle Bound has 103 LTC's listed on AQ - so the winner will receive about 100 cards!!<br>
<br>
Thank you SB for your donation!!<br>
<br>
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
In an effort to raise additional monies to pay off our medical bills, I am raffling off most of my hand carved stamps (that haven't been planted) & LTC's.<br>
<br>
16 raffles will be for individual stamps. Some older than others. Some more detailed than others. Each will be sent out with a brief description of when I carved it and why I carved it.<br>
<br>
2 more raffles will be for sets of stamps. One set is of my earliest carvings, on Pink Erasers. Another set used as a reward system for my kids when they were very little. I will send further description with the stamps to the winner.<br>
<br>
1 raffle will be of my LTC's -- a copy of many of the LTC's I've ever made.<br>
<br>
The final raffle will be of a custom stamp I will carve for the winner. The image will be chosen by the winner! I will have the winner send me a picture of what they want carved, collaborate with them, and then carve it for them.<br>
<br>
TWENTY RAFFLES!!<br>
<br>
Raffle Tickets are $5 each - or BONUS - 5 tickets for $20 (receive an extra ticket for every $20 given)!<br>
