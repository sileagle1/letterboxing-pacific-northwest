the very cool Musician Series in Forest Park, one of the Minstrel's<br>
Aphrodite boxes, Cedar Hill Twin #1 (where did this thing go all last<br>

Happy Hitch Hiker Bob left his home inside the Cedar Hills box and is<br>
now nestled in my backpack awaiting transport to parts unknown. Two<br>
new boxes found homes during our travels. Watch for their clues<br>

in our area. I just LOVE entertaining letterbox vagabonds. Funhog<br>
