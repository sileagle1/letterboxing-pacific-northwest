Ryan and I stop at often after hiking in the North Bend/Issaquah area.<br/>
It is in the shopping center off East Lake Sammamish Parkway. Take<br/>
that exit off of I-90. <br/>
<br/>
If you are driving around 405 towards Renton and the Airport, you can<br/>
get off at exit #5 Sunset Blvd, turn west onto E. Park Drive, turn<br/>
right onto Lk. Washington Blvd N., turn left at the next intersection<br/>
into Gene Coulon Memorial Beach Park in Renton. There are a couple of<br/>
letterboxes at this park and there is also an Ivar's for seafood and a<br/>
Kidd Valley for burgers Both are Pacific Northwest chains, unique to<br/>
this area! And the Kidd Valley milkshakes are terrific!!<br/>
<br/>
Bai Tong Thai on International Drive (hwy 99) near the airport is a<br/>
good place for Thai. <br/>
