Thank you for your concern but the placer of this box is active, as you know, and is aware of it's status and is in the process of reactivating it. I appreciate your concern and would appreciate even further than anyone who has questions about a box of mine contact me directly. <br>

>Glad to report that the "HISS"-ing cat we adopted this past year is <br>
>alive and well. She survived our windy, wet winter intact and has <br>
>been pretty active too. We are "camped out" nearby several weekends <br>
>each spring/summer/fall relaxing so this it is real fun checking on <br>
>it and reading the logbook.<br>
><br>
>I did go and check on the "Harry at Hogwarts" hitchhiker hostel and <br>
>see if there had been any activity or maintenece needed.This box was <br>
>placed several years ago for an event and seems to have fallen off <br>
>the radar. I have, somewhere a copy of the origianal directions but <br>
>have relied on the powers of my sometimes fading memory. With <br>
>Hogwarts being a very exlusive and magical place it has been know to <br>
>become the residence of an occasional hitchiker or two for months and <br>
>once for over a year. When I realized that two years ago I have made <br>
>a point to conduct a survey and see if anyone is ready to resume <br>
>their journey. Hogwarts survived the winter even though several <br>
>nearby patriarchs whom shielded the magical place were felled by <br>
>forces both natural and un-natural.<br>
><br>
>While visiting the school I thought..hmm...are the clues to this <br>
>magical place still active in my mind and a few others, since there <br>
>had been only one visitor in the past couple of years. So, I took the <br>
>time to really thumb through the school's "yearbook" and noticed <br>
>that  it had been adopted and that the clues were available at AQ. So <br>
>I left the newest resident of this exclusive academy for someone else <br>
>to find since I figured it was going to be easier to get directions <br>
>again. Today I searched several databases for the elusive directions <br>
>to this elite, prestigous school and didn't find any. <br>
>I am in the "area" several times a year so I always check on the box <br>
>to see if I can help hikers on their journey and make sure that there <br>
>are not any magical "tiles" missing on the roof which could reveal <br>
>the true location of Hogwart's. <br>
><br>
>I notice that Professor Dumbledore has listed that Maiden has been <br>
>offically appointed one of the caretakers of Hogwarts and I would be <br>
>honored if she would contact me regarding the status of it. I'm <br>
>willing and able to check on it periodically since I'm a frequent <br>
>visitor to the general area. I left the schools current resident <br>
>there and have decided that if the powers that be are amenable. I am <br>
>offering to become an assistant caretaker of it.  I'll even say that <br>
>if we want to bring the school back into the limelight this term I'll <br>
>find the set of orginal directions to it and publish them. If so I <br>
>would be willing to accept any new hitchikers who would like to visit <br>
>there over Mothers Day weekend if anyone wants to send them my way.<br>
