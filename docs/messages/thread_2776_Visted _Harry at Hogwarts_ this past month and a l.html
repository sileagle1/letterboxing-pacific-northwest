Thank you for your concern but the placer of this box is active, as you know, and is aware of it's status and is in the process of reactivating it. I appreciate your concern and would appreciate even further than anyone who has questions about a box of mine contact me directly. <br/>

&gt;Subject: [LbPNW] Visted "Harry at Hogwarts" this past month and a local cat too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;                  <br/>
&gt;Glad to report that the "HISS"-ing cat we adopted this past year is <br/>
&gt;alive and well. She survived our windy, wet winter intact and has <br/>
&gt;been pretty active too. We are "camped out" nearby several weekends <br/>
&gt;each spring/summer/fall relaxing so this it is real fun checking on <br/>
&gt;it and reading the logbook.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did go and check on the "Harry at Hogwarts" hitchhiker hostel and <br/>
&gt;see if there had been any activity or maintenece needed.This box was <br/>
&gt;placed several years ago for an event and seems to have fallen off <br/>
&gt;the radar. I have, somewhere a copy of the origianal directions but <br/>
&gt;have relied on the powers of my sometimes fading memory. With <br/>
&gt;Hogwarts being a very exlusive and magical place it has been know to <br/>
&gt;become the residence of an occasional hitchiker or two for months and <br/>
&gt;once for over a year. When I realized that two years ago I have made <br/>
&gt;a point to conduct a survey and see if anyone is ready to resume <br/>
&gt;their journey. Hogwarts survived the winter even though several <br/>
&gt;nearby patriarchs whom shielded the magical place were felled by <br/>
&gt;forces both natural and un-natural.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While visiting the school I thought..hmm...are the clues to this <br/>
&gt;magical place still active in my mind and a few others, since there <br/>
&gt;had been only one visitor in the past couple of years. So, I took the <br/>
&gt;time to really thumb through the school's "yearbook" and noticed <br/>
&gt;that  it had been adopted and that the clues were available at AQ. So <br/>
&gt;I left the newest resident of this exclusive academy for someone else <br/>
&gt;to find since I figured it was going to be easier to get directions <br/>
&gt;again. Today I searched several databases for the elusive directions <br/>
&gt;to this elite, prestigous school and didn't find any. <br/>
&gt;I am in the "area" several times a year so I always check on the box <br/>
&gt;to see if I can help hikers on their journey and make sure that there <br/>
&gt;are not any magical "tiles" missing on the roof which could reveal <br/>
&gt;the true location of Hogwart's. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I notice that Professor Dumbledore has listed that Maiden has been <br/>
&gt;offically appointed one of the caretakers of Hogwarts and I would be <br/>
&gt;honored if she would contact me regarding the status of it. I'm <br/>
&gt;willing and able to check on it periodically since I'm a frequent <br/>
&gt;visitor to the general area. I left the schools current resident <br/>
&gt;there and have decided that if the powers that be are amenable. I am <br/>
&gt;offering to become an assistant caretaker of it.  I'll even say that <br/>
&gt;if we want to bring the school back into the limelight this term I'll <br/>
&gt;find the set of orginal directions to it and publish them. If so I <br/>
&gt;would be willing to accept any new hitchikers who would like to visit <br/>
&gt;there over Mothers Day weekend if anyone wants to send them my way.<br/>
