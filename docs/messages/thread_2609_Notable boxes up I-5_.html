                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
We're going to be heading up to Vancouver, BC next week.  Anyone have any<br>
notable boxes from about Chehalis on up that they recommend?  We'll be along<br>
I-5 except when we detour to visit in Federal Way (camping at Dash Point<br>
SP), Shoreline, and Elma (Montesano, really).  The friend in Shoreline isn't<br>
a boxer so we'd like to make sure and go to a box that is not missing there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Can someone give us a heads up on boxes that are missing but still listed on<br>
LBNA?  That information is like gold!  Our time will be limited.   <br>
<br>
There's quite a number of boxes up there so any help is much appreciated.<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you go thru Elma during business hours there are two letterboxes at<br>
the Elma Library.  <br>
<br>
"Elma Timberland Library" and "The Ocean Voyage" both by "Donna"<br>
<br>
They are listed in the Elma Library's card catalogue which is online<br>
and you can look them up on your computer before you leave.<br>
<br>
If you go to Hoquiam their library also has a box and you follow clues<br>
throughout the library to find the box.  <br>
It is called "Hungry For Wood" by Margie2005.<br>
<br>
Have a fun trip, H-A-F<br>
