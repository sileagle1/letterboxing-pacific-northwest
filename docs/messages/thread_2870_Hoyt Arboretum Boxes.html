                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi friends - went out today (just could not stand one single more day<br>
inside) to check on the three boxes I put up at the Hoyt Arboretum a<br>
while back, and also to see if I could find the Fall Harvest series. <br>
All four of the harvest boxes are fine, dry, and have delightful<br>
stamps in them.  The hike is a wonderful trek through the arboretum<br>
area, mostly on the "west" side of the main road up from the zoo.  On<br>
the easterly side of the road the three boxes I placed (all carved by<br>
others) are also doing just fine thanks to some wonderfully kind<br>
boxers who have replaced a couple of full books.  I had no idea these<br>
would have so many visitors.  I thanked these people personally when<br>
they told me they had put new log books in but want to say again here<br>
that it's so nice to have people do that when a book gets full.  So if<br>
anyone wants seven boxes and can hike maybe 3 miles or so total, these<br>
are all available.  Hoyt Arboretum Series is listed at LBNA and AQ,<br>
but you need to look at AQ for the Fall Harvest At Hoyt Arboretum<br>
series, only listed there.  Wonderful stamps by Der Mad Stamper, Aunt<br>
Teri, Raqs Enigma, and 2 Hats and a Dog.<br>
