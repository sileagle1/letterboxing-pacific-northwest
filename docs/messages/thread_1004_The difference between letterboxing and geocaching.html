Can anyone tell me the difference between letterboxing and <br>
geocaching.  I was trying to explain it to my girlfriend and I <br>
couldn't figure out the difference.  Thanks<br>

Geocaching you are given and GPS coordinate and you locate it with a GPS <br>
device. You sign in and usually a small token is exchanged.<br>
