<br/>
I don't normally cross post -- but considering both these events <br/>
happened here locally I thought I would just in case some of you <br/>
don't read the LbNA list.<br/>
<br/>
I am utterly distressed at a couple of experiences I have had lately<br/>
and I thought I would share them with the group.<br/>
<br/>
With my being sick I recently asked another letter boxer to go out<br/>
and check some of my boxes that were reported missing. To my<br/>
disappointment she reported that indeed the boxes were missing, but<br/>
worse, the areas they were in had been torn apart in an obvious<br/>
attempt to search for the boxes. I am so disappointed to see that<br/>
there are letter boxers out there with an inclusive disregard for the<br/>
beauty of nature and the environment that these special treasures are<br/>
concealed in. I told Iron`Bear that personally I feel desecrated.<br/>
Each and every place that I hide a letterbox has some sort of special<br/>
meaning to me. It is somewhere Iron`Bear and I have been together,<br/>
it is a reminiscence of special times we have had to have someone go<br/>
in and annihilate it, you might as well walk into our home and start<br/>
ripping up pictures in my photo album. I'm hoping Iron`Bear will<br/>
write more on this topic later, as I think he could do a much better<br/>
job explaining how disconcerting this is than I can his heritage and<br/>
appreciation for nature is something we both take very seriously.<br/>
<br/>
My next disappointment was yesterday when Iron`Bear and I went out to<br/>
grab a few easy letterboxes. We found one of the boxes with a<br/>
inequitable message written on the container, telling people they<br/>
could remove the box if they wanted too, the box completely empty<br/>
except for the stamp and a piece of a notebook paper with the<br/>
signature stamp of someone that had visited the box shortly before<br/>
us. I don't know what the heck is wrong with people that they would<br/>
do something like that. Seriously, whoever did that, I just want to<br/>
know what the hell your damage is??? I will admit, though I don't<br/>
mean to slam anyone that I was a little taken back why the person<br/>
that stamped in before us chose not to do something to fix the box.<br/>
Iron`Bear and I took the box back to our car, taped an index card<br/>
over the defamatory and callous message with the generic "This is a<br/>
letterbox please do not remove, for more information please visit<br/>
www.letterboxing.org" message. We also put together a quick on the<br/>
site logbook, protected it in a zip lock bag and then replaced the<br/>
letterbox and contacted the placer to let them know what we found and<br/>
how we fixed it.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that sometimes accidents happen and things get messed<br/>
up, but to see people deliberately vandalizing letterboxes and<br/>
surround areas really agitates me. I can assure the group of one<br/>
thing, if I keep seeing this sort of thing happening to the area<br/>
around my letterboxes, they will no longer be publicized for everyone<br/>
to go get, I will find some other means of making an attempt to make<br/>
sure that responsible people are visiting these locations.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>
A very disgruntled  pandora{HIB}  "Pandy" of Team Chaos<br/>
