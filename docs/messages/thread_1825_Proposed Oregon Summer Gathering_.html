The Nail Family concurs.  The weekend after July 4 (that would be<br/>
8,9,10) would be ideal. Work prevents any activities around the 4th<br/>
but since we have family in Salem it would work for us to do a combo<br/>
family visit/letterboxing event that weekend.<br/>

Camp at Silver Falls? At one of the most scenic <br/>
parks in the state? No need to ask twice. I'm <br/>
there! The weekend of the 9th sounds good <br/>
to me, too.<br/>
<br/>
When I met with the staff at that park last year, <br/>
they actually suggested that we hold an event <br/>
there. The word was that there is an entire <br/>
network of trails away from the waterfalls that <br/>
are woefully underused. Their hopes were that <br/>
the presence of letterboxes would get hikers <br/>
into that part of the park, too. <br/>
<br/>
Trails that rarely get used, staff that welcomes <br/>
our hobby, a part of the park unlikely to be <br/>
inundated with visitors. Sounds like a win-win <br/>
situation to me. Sign me up...<br/>

We're up for a July gathering, too--the 3rd or 4th weekend would be <br/>
best for us.  The weekend after 4 July is a complete no-go with us, <br/>
though as work beckons then!  :(<br/>

Camp at Silver Falls? At one of the most scenic <br/>
parks in the state? No need to ask twice. I'm <br/>
there! The weekend of the 9th sounds good <br/>
to me, too.<br/>
<br/>
When I met with the staff at that park last year, <br/>
they actually suggested that we hold an event <br/>
there. The word was that there is an entire <br/>
network of trails away from the waterfalls that <br/>
are woefully underused. Their hopes were that <br/>
the presence of letterboxes would get hikers <br/>
into that part of the park, too. <br/>
<br/>
Trails that rarely get used, staff that welcomes <br/>
our hobby, a part of the park unlikely to be <br/>
inundated with visitors. Sounds like a win-win <br/>
situation to me. Sign me up...<br/>

I work the second weekend, but the 15-16th would be great. Maybe we <br/>
could take a vote.<br/>

this point!  Twist my arm, count us in!  Wingnut<br/>

&gt; I propose a summer gathering/campout at a group camping site at <br/>
&gt; Silver Falls this year sometime in July. I propose Silver Falls as <br/>
&gt; it is a beautiful park and thanks to our goodwill piggie <br/>
ambassador, <br/>
&gt; letterboxing is allowed there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I propose this gathering to work similar to the Milo gathering in <br/>
&gt; that it would be pretty informal and a Friday and Saturday night <br/>
&gt; (come for some or all). Just a date, location, planned time for a <br/>
&gt; potluck/stamp exchange and a consensus victim for carving the event<br/>
&gt; stamp. I'm not in charge, I'm basically just volunteering to secure <br/>
&gt; the group site and do some minor coordination like reminder posts <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; the list. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Folks are more than welcome to take upon themselves planning stamp <br/>
&gt; carving or book binding how-to sessions or even discussions on the <br/>
&gt; finer nuances of John Candy movies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what say you - want to do this? If so, respond with any <br/>
&gt; preference/bad dates on the weekend in July, I'll try to figure out <br/>
&gt; what works best and make the reservation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
