don't remember if the posts were concrete or wood. Did you find any of<br>
the other landmarks? I do know that Ryan managed to find the box using<br>
the clues as they were written. But then, he does have major letterbox<br>
radar. Let's have our gathering out there the weekend of July 10-11 so<br>
I can check on this baby. Whadya think? Funhog<br>

That's a Thurs-Fri--Did you mean July12-13 (Sat-Sun)?<br>
<br>
At any rate, Heather and I might just have to take another run at Royal <br>
Angler before then (either sans children or with more granola bars!).  Since <br>
we also want to get the Alaska Bound box before it goes north--and we hear <br>
that Dog Mountain is lovely in the spring--we'll see if Royal Angler lures us <br>
in again.<br>
