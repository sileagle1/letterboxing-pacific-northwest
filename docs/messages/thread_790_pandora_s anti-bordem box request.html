<br/>
For those of you that don't know I have been pretty sick here recently and<br/>
just underwent minor surgery a couple of days ago.  This of course has put<br/>
me out of commission for letterboxing yet again.  It is rather sad as since<br/>
I started letterboxing in February I have been "laid off" so to speak from<br/>
this wonderful sport, not once, but twice now, for long periods of time.  As<br/>
a special request I really would appreciate anyone that would be willing to<br/>
send me some traveling letterboxes or so Postal Letterboxes so that I can<br/>
have a little fun and gain a few stamps during this icky time.  If anyone<br/>
has anything they can contribute to Pandora's anti-boredom box request (or<br/>
even if you feeling especially kind and would create a letterbox that falls<br/>
into these categories) please let me know and email me privately at<br/>
hispandora@phlsystems.com for my address information.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>

Have you tried some of the virtual letterboxes?  They are time consuming and lead you into some interesting areas, there is one with cows that is a hoot!  I found them thru google: virtual letterboxing  there are several places to look (part of the challange).  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
