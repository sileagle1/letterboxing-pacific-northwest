                    <div class="plaintext-content">On such a glorious spring day I just had to play hooky from work and <br/>
head out for a hike. I meet a pig in the parking lot and proceeded to <br/>
voluntarily load 30 pounds of water, rocks, trail books, and a laptop <br/>
computer onto my back. We headed down Leif Erickson Drive (this is a <br/>
trail, not a road) in Forest Park to admire the abundance of trilliums <br/>
in bloom. Along the way we stopped by to find the latest additions to <br/>
the Musician Series by Camp Fire Lady and Maiden. These are boxes that <br/>
should not be missed by any local boxer. After nabbing the boxes we <br/>
continued down the trail, up Hardesty, back on the muddy Wildwood <br/>
trail, down Water Line and then back on Leif Erickson to the cars for <br/>
about a six mile loop, making for a nice training run for this <br/>
summer's backpacking (something I'm planning for part of my sabbatical <br/>
July/August this year). <br/>
<br/>
I encourage all to get out there to get these boxes: with the older <br/>
boxes there are now ten boxes in the series. Note that you are allowed <br/>
to hunt these without a 30 pound pack and if you just go out and back <br/>
on Leif Erickson Drive it is an flat easy stroll of less than 4 miles.<br/>

Boy, howdy, I've got to say, you carry some pretty bizarre stuff when<br/>
you go backpacking. ;o) Well, the water is logical, and even *one*<br/>
trail book might make a lot of sense, but rocks and a laptop are<br/>
entirely unnecessary. *nodding*<br/>

I vote for Little Debbies or anything chocolate!<br/>
<br/>
On another note (ha ha). I got my patch the other day and have been  <br/>
meaning to say nice job FunHog! They came out really cute!<br/>
Now I'm torn with this good weather -  letterbox or take time to sew  <br/>
this patch on!? Maybe some quick iron on stuff or glue!?<br/>
