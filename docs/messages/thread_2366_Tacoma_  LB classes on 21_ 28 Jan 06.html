I've volunteered to help out with a couple of these as has Helen who <br/>
helped teach the previous class.  <br/>
<br/>
It'd be great to see some of you there.  There are a couple of <br/>
letterboxes on the premises and they'd enjoy seeing some more, I <br/>
presume, too.  ;)  They've apparently fixed up the trails since last <br/>
time I was there and have renumbered the nature trail markers--so <br/>
the clues to the current boxes will change soon.<br/>
