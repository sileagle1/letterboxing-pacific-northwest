I've never felt badly about supporting something I use.  I have even <br>
considered purchasing Oregon's pass, because I use their parks.  There have <br>
been so many visible improvements in the 4 parks on the island, here, that <br>
are a direct result of access to these fees.  It's interesting to me to <br>
watch our state's priorities.  If the fees are repealed, I think we will pay <br>
a different price for our parks, in the form of reduced programs for our <br>
children, increased vandalism by people who just don't care (now that they <br>
don't have to pay $5 to drink beer in the backwoods), and possibly closures. <br>
The other thing that concerns me is how any possible replacements of the <br>
income, if found, will be apportioned.  I believe the current system has <br>
each park directly benefiting from at least a portion of the fees they bring <br>
in.  If the fees are repealed, some of those lovely, tiny parks that we are <br>
so fond of are likely to have to claw, scratch, and bite to obtain funding <br>
that will naturally be likely to go to larger, more popular parks like our <br>
Deception Pass.<br>
<br>
OK.  Off my soapbox, now.  :-P<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I purchased the annual pass 3 years in a row--even though a <br>
family member (with whom we often go hiking) gets it for free for <br>
being a disabled veteran.  What ticked me off about it though is <br>
that as soon as the parking fee went into place they closed the park <br>
nearest us (Tolmie SP & many others around the state) more often <br>
than it was open so it was almost a moot point for us.  That was odd-<br>
-they charge the fee then closed a bunch of parks despite it!  <br>
<br>
The ironic effect of the parking fee, though, is that folks refused <br>
to visit the parks because of the exorbitant fee, which in turn <br>
caused attendance to drop, which in turn reduced the additional <br>
funding parks received from the state (as the funding is based on <br>
attendance numbers).  It was self-defeating.  I don't mind the fee <br>
but I wish the daily fee was much lower than $5!  Since the fee went <br>
into effect we rarely saw more than 1 or 2 vehicles in the area <br>
state parks when we visited.  Not good for future funding from a <br>
budgeting perspective.  I'd support $1-$2 for parking and perhaps a <br>
$25-$30 annual pass with a discount toward camping fees for those <br>
pass holders--but they didn't take anything like that into <br>
consideration.  It was less expensive to not purchase a park pass <br>
and camp your way through the system because camping still gave you <br>
a daily pass to the parks for the same price that annual pass <br>
holders had to pay even though they'd already spent $50 on the pass. <br>
Frustrating anyway you look at it.<br>
<br>
I didn't post the info to provoke an argument.  Just to let folks <br>
know what was going on with the park pass in the event they don't <br>
read the area newspapers.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Remember, the park fees are a very recent thing and were instituted<br>
because of a deficit in the state bank account -- now that there's a<br>
surplus, the funding mechanism is back in place -- the fees (which have<br>
been HUGELY unpopular) are being removed.<br>
<br>
The amount of grief the legislature has taken over this "twice tax" (as<br>
it's been touted) is unbelievable.  The fact is, taxes are paid and<br>
state parks are to be maintained out of that fund.  The extra fee was<br>
supposed to be just for a short time to cover a deficit in the state<br>
fund.<br>
<br>
I'm not a) sure it will be a problem at all or b) sure they had a real<br>
choice in the matter, given we're coming up on mid-term elections...<br>
