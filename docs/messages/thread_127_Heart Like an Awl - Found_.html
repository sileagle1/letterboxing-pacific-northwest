Managed to get out during a break in the torrential downpours yesterday and<br/>
search for the Heart Like an Awl box - and found it!  Was a nice hike with<br/>
beautiful vistas and a wonderfully carved stamp as an additional reward.<br/>
The box was warm and dry.  One person had written a log entry before us - no<br/>
stamp though.<br/>
