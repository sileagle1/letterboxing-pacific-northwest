                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the reply!  Unfortunately this is only a county park, so no cool<br/>
Jr. Ranger stuff available.  We do have a playground on the beach and I'm<br/>
sure they'll spend a fair amount of time just throwing stones into the<br/>
water.  I picked up some Halloween group craft projects at Michaels today so<br/>
we'll have an activity in case it rains or they want a break from hiking.<br/>

Is there a Junior Ranger Program at the park? That seemed to go over<br/>
well with the kids at our Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp. We also<br/>
