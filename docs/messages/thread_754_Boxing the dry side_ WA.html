                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just made it home from a business trip to eastern WA. Instead of<br>
flying this time, I packed up the camping gear, grabbed the<br>
letterboxing backpack and started up the little red car. Along the<br>
way, I found P-Orc's lovely Maryhill stamp; struck out on Bethany's<br>
Stonhenge, my comeupance, I'm sure; whooped and hollered when I found<br>
Hanglider's Home Away From Home. Check out this clue and GO THERE!!! <br>
<br>
Knowing that Hanglider and the Gardener had never met another<br>
letteboxer, I made a point of getting together with them for an<br>
official stamp exchange and box hunt. We tried to ferret out the<br>
elusive Spokane Ghetto box, to no avail. The fact that the clues<br>
didn't match the place didn't make things any easier. These deprived<br>
folks need many more boxes to look for. Leave a box if you are<br>
anywhere near Spokane. It is your civic duty. I did leave them one to<br>
track down before the snow flies. I also added two of the three Manito<br>
Park stamps to my logbook. Number three may be missing.<br>
<br>
On the return, I tracked down Eliza B's Trees of Stone, Fudrick's<br>
Roosevelt Park and Hoopoe's Umptanum Falls. This last has an image<br>
that I will cherish, being a particular favorite. Bethany's Merci<br>
Train in Yakima was my last find of the trip. <br>
<br>
Naturally, I couldn't take a trip without leaving vinyl in my tracks.<br>
There will soon be clues for the new one in Spokane, two in the Yakima<br>
River Canyon and a box I placed for Matt the Rat as part of his 45th<br>
Parallel series in Oregon. Two of my three new stamps were carved in<br>
camp by the light of a very small campfire, a votive candle. So they<br>
are a bit on the rough side. I forgot my lantern and the batteries I<br>
bought for my flashlight were duds.<br>
<br>
This was all in all, a very successful business trip. Fun,<br>
work...50/50...or is it 60/40? Funhog<br>
