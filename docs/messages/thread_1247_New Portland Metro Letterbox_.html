the nearest letterboxing website for the clues, these clues are only <br/>
available via "word of mouth." So you'll have to either figure out <br/>
who to ask for the clues or wait for a friendly fellow boxer to <br/>
spread the word to you. You might be able to figure out who to ask <br/>
from this post, but no fair going around randomly asking everyone <br/>
you know for the clues!<br/>

I have no plans to monitor this email account. Response to email <br/>
sent to my more familiar account(s) may be slow. <br/>
