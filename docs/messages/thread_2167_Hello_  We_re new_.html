                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found out about letterboxing when I was planning a trip to Sequim <br/>
and thought we might go thru Quinalt Rain Forest.  Their website for <br/>
the rain forest has link regarding Letterboxing.  Out of curiosity, I <br/>
clicked on it and was pleasantly surprised!<br/>
We have had a blast so far and have gotten lots, and lots of excercise <br/>
without even realizing it!<br/>
And Letterboxing saved my bacon on that road trip to Sequim.  We <br/>
(myself and 2 dd 8 1/2 &amp; 6) went up there for the lavender festival.  <br/>
What was supposed to be decent weather turned out to be a down pour <br/>
and very cold.  The girls were SO not impressed!  So I decided to <br/>
swing by the Sequim library, hopped on their internet 'puter to copy <br/>
down clues while the girls dried out and looked at books.  Got some <br/>
great clues for one in Brinnon and someothers on the way back.  What <br/>
was a potentially miserable trip for all of us, turned out to be a <br/>
pleasant hike in the woods (turns out we didn't go far enough for <br/>
either one, but will be going back with hubby!)<br/>
I now have a backpack with all our lb stuff plus will always include <br/>
bugspray, gloves and a flashlight!<br/>
Thanks to all of you that have hidden such awesome handmade stamps...I <br/>
look forward to finding more and hopefully meeting some you great <br/>
people!'<br/>

We've attended the Sequim Lavendar Festival quite regularly over the <br/>
past few years--except for this past year due to some work <br/>
requirements.  Absolutely love it!  Did you find the LB near Brinnon?  <br/>
If so, that was likely ours.  I think it's been there for over 2 years <br/>
without any visitors (or anybody who's mentioned they'd found it).  <br/>
It'd be awesome to see some more boxes in and around the area.  That's <br/>
one of our favorite spots on the Earth!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing and we look forward to hearing about your <br/>
adventures in the future.<br/>

find that may need it. <br/>
