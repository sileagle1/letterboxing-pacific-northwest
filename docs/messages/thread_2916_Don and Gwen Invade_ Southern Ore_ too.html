I got my parents into letterboxing when we visited them last June. They live in Rogue River and my mom, Harthaven, has planted 40 boxes!!<br>
<br>
They're not a part of this message boards but would love for you to find some of their boxes, and/or actually meet them. I will forward this Email to my mom.<br>
