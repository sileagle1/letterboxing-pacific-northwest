Come join Cat's Meow and I for lunch and a Christmas Ornament<br/>
Exchange Gathering at Izzy's restaurant located at 7615 E. Mill Plain <br/>
Blvd. in Vancouver,WA., Saturday, December 11 at 1:00<br/>
pm. I was so inspired by a recent PLB that I received and thought it <br/>
would be a great way to get some of the many letterboxers in the <br/>
Vancouver and surrounding areas together to finally meet each other. <br/>
In order to participate in the ornament exchange, you must bring an <br/>
ornament, hand made, with the theme of letterboxing, and wrapped in <br/>
holiday wrapping paper. We will have lunch, exchange signature and <br/>
gathering stamps, play some fun games and everyone can then go find <br/>
some of the wonderful letterboxes that are planted all over the <br/>
Vancouver area. Please R.S.V.P., A.S.A.P. to tinarie at msn dot com <br/>
if you would like to come. If you cannot make it at 1:00 for lunch <br/>
then please join us at 2:00 for the exchange. See you there!<br/>
