Abso-freaking-lutely!!!  Wild Child &amp; I will be pitching a tent, and bringing <br/>
our marshmallow-roasting sticks.  (May even have the hubby along, who likes <br/>
any excuse to sleep outside...)<br/>

Good luck with your future arrival.  The good news is that I happen <br/>
to be a labor and delivery nurse and there is a hospital only 30 <br/>
minutes from McIver. So now you have no excuse:) We would really be <br/>
missing out if you don't come. Oh ya, statistics say only 10% of <br/>
babies are born on there due date:)<br/>

woman makes all the rules :)<br/>
