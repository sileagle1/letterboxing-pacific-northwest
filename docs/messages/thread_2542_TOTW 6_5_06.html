I have also found a carved stamp on a piece of wood... difficult to <br/>
get a good stamp image but I think it was one of those inspired <br/>
spontaneous ones that are fun. I found one in a remote location that <br/>
was in a clear plastic bottle that I at first thought was glass. The <br/>
most unusual hiding place I really can't describe without giving it <br/>
away. Let's just say it was fun and entertaining to the max.<br/>

What are some of the more unusual letterbox components you have<br/>
found? I'm thinking, unusual hiding places, unusual box containers,<br/>
unique log books, or even, a stamp made out of something other than<br/>
the regular materials.<br/>
<br/>
No letterbox names if it will give away any of the surprise. I'm<br/>
hoping this will inspire people with neat ideas.<br/>
<br/>
As always, looking for additional topics for TOTW.<br/>

I used to go fishing with my dad.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going fishing and searching for this box, let me know.  <br/>
I'd be interested and it's been many many years since I fished.  <br/>
<br/>
Sigh.  I miss my dad.<br/>
