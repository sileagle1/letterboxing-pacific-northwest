<br/>
Just a note about the Ft Steilacoom (6) letterbox series I placed <br/>
eons ago.  Went to replace the missing boxes today and checked on <br/>
the others.  Long story short--<br/>
<br/>
#1-insane asylum--same box moved to a slightly different location--<br/>
seems more treasure hunters were finding it than letterboxers in its <br/>
old hiding spot and it's been decimated<br/>
<br/>
#2-heath farm--no change, clues slightly amended as features in the <br/>
park have changed<br/>
<br/>
#3-RIP--missing, hiding spot decimated--not sure if we'll replace <br/>
this one--treasure hunters also in the vicinity<br/>
<br/>
#4-purple pumpkin--alive &amp; well as all odd pumpkins should be<br/>
<br/>
#5-model boat--replaced with a new letterbox in a totally different <br/>
hiding spot<br/>
<br/>
#6-leschi gallows--replaced with a new letterbox in a totally <br/>
different hiding spot<br/>
<br/>
Also, found these letterboxes placed by others--unfortunately, we <br/>
ran out of daylight to look for the others in the park:<br/>
<br/>
fledgling (amanda from seattle)--alive &amp; well<br/>
haunted house (fudrick)--alive &amp; well<br/>
pirate's treasure (ryan)--alive &amp; well<br/>
patriotic box (1 of the 7Nails)--alive &amp; well<br/>
