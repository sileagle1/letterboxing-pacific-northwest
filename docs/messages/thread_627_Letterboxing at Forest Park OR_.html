Muck's most productive day yet with 10 letterboxes in all and found <br>
every one that we set out to find! WOOHOO! We started off returning <br>
to "What's for Dinner" box #1 that was missing on our outing last <br>
week. Thanks Funhog for replacing it so promptly. We even picked up <br>
our first HH "Here's Looking At You Kid". I let out a scream that I <br>
am sure the whole park heard. It is tucked away nicely in my backpack <br>
to be placed soon. Next it was off to find the Upper Macleay Park <br>
Series. What a beautiful trail! All 4 boxes are alive and well and <br>
wonderful stamps. On the way back down the trail Willow and I were <br>
attempting the limbo under the tree when Willow who was in front did <br>
one of those forward "lose your balance" things and couldn't stop. <br>
Needless to say she hit the trail with a skid and a thump almost <br>
knocking my daughter Cat's Meow over the side of the trail. Cat's <br>
Meow who is 8 years old put out her arms to stop Willow from falling <br>
but realized at the last minute that an 8 year old can't stop a 40 <br>
something, 6 foot tall Willow from toppeling. After we made sure <br>
Willow was OK we had a huge laugh and went along our merry way. Where <br>
was the video camera when you need it? Next it was off to find "Goofy <br>
Pub Names Series". All 5 boxes are alive and well although the clues <br>
for #4 & #5 were pretty vague. There were more than one each of the <br>
holy trees, fallen logs and blue diamonds that confused us but we <br>
prevailed. Everyone on the trails had their dogs along which gave us <br>
a large variety of breeds to pet along the way. Cat's Meow was loving <br>
everyone one of them as she passed.You see, her only pet is a <br>
parakeet cuz we don't have a yard for a dog. Anyway, thank you <br>
Paisley Orca and Canada Goose for some wonderful stamps.<br>
