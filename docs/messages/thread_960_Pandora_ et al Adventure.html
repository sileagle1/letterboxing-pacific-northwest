when I saw the word MUGGED in the subject line.  I'm glad you that you<br>
were not mugged.  <br>
<br>
You're right...Sleight is a very well hidden LB.  But it is definitely<br>
there.  Carie of Lennens 3 found it the previous Saturday.  You know the<br>
'Hog.  She hides them well!  <br>
<br>
Glad you had fun letterboxing this weekend and that no serious crimes<br>
were actually  committed on your person.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

We are making plans to perhaps meet up with that silly Hog so she can <br>
get a hog belly laugh outta watching us scamper for a box that seems <br>
to be RIGHT under our nose!<br>
<br>
Thanks for the tip that it is there though.<br>
As for no serious crimes -- <br>
<br>
I guess this means you don't have sympathy for my stolen hitchhiker <br>
either???<br>

Waaa waaa waaaaa<br>
