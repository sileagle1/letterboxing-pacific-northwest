They're usually referred to as "trail names," and it evolved from a <br/>
longstanding tradition among hikers to have a unique moniker that they use <br/>
to sign in to trail logs as they hike. For letterboxers, it's all part of <br/>
the fun and mystery to come up with a unique name that reflects your <br/>
personal interests or personality. For many, their personal stamp also <br/>
reflects their trail name in some way, too.<br/>
<br/>
(Um, that's not to say that people without trail names don't have personal <br/>
interests or personality.... <g> )<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many people believe that it's safer to use nick names when in cyber space. Some just like nick names. And since this is a fun sport, some of us just get silly. It's just personal preferance. Some also use team names for families and other groups that letterbox together. For example, I have been a member of a group called the Brat Pack for over 5 years. This group has changed in membership several times, but there have always been two people that have been the same. These two people are now playing letterboxing games. So...we made a brat pack stamp and use that to stamp in when we are out together so that stamping in is faster. This is important in the rain! And who lets a little rain keep them from letterboxing? (I don't, however, I do tend to stay in more just to paint, which is another one of my passions.) Also, the brat pack has pooled some talents in order to do some boxes together. So far, one of our series, the 2X2 Series is my fav of all my boxes. My spouse and I al so<br/>
  have a team name that we have used for other sports and games. Team Nashoba is me, my spouse, and my two k-9s. I hope that is what you were asking about. If not.....I was NEVER here, you NEVER saw me, and I don't know what you are talking about. :)<br/>
