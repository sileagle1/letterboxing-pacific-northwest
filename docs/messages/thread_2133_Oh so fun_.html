                    <div class="plaintext-content">It certainly sounds like you all had a wonderful time.  Thanks for the <br/>
kind note.  I was 'overcome by events' and will continue to be out of <br/>
the LB loop until the Fall, unfortunately.  I was pretty torn that we <br/>
had to nix the event and a subsequent mini-vacation following it, at <br/>
the last minute--as I'd been looking forward to it for MONTHS.  A <br/>
project that I'm 'losing my summer to' has grown quite unwieldy and has <br/>
required more time than I predicted (it's a 3 year requirement <br/>
condensed into 3 months--yuck).  Take pleasure in knowing that I missed <br/>
the event not for 'pleasurable reasons' but rather to sit home and pore <br/>
over 600 pages of technical reading each day--been doing that for <br/>
almost three weeks straight!  :(  Hopefully, I'll reign this project in <br/>
prior to the Liberty Lake Gathering and can join in on the fun.  <br/>
Believe me, by then, I'll definitely need it!!! Times a thousand!!!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great summer everybody!  I'll live vicariously through your <br/>
comments, so post often. :)<br/>
