weekend.<br>
<br>
Box one is missing.  The stump it was hidden in has disintigrated <br>
greatly since I last visited.  Large chunks have fallen off.  I have <br>
no doubt this is normal woodpecker and weather fall out.  I did not <br>
dig in the very deep druff to look for the box, I might go back <br>
another time to do so.<br>
<br>
Box two and box three are alive and well exactly where planted.  <br>
These clues are a bit of a challenge, so if you did not find, try <br>
again!<br>
