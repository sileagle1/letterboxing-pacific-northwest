<br>
Would there be any interest out there in 'resectioning' WA's map on <br>
the letterboxing.org (LBNA) page?  I've currently been working on <br>
amending the Puget Sound map bit to more accurately reflect where <br>
Seattle, Tacoma and Olympia are located and to clean up the <br>
region 'borders' as they don't properly line up at the moment.<br>
<br>
What I've noticed in the process is that there are a couple hundred <br>
boxes in Region 2 (WA's LB megalopolis--Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, <br>
Island, King & Pierce Counties) known as "North West/Puget Sound <br>
Letterboxes" and Region 5 (Vancouver area) and then just a couple <br>
dozen or a handful scattered about the other Regions throughout the <br>
state.<br>
<br>
Would anybody object to separating out at least Pierce & King <br>
Counties from Region 2--perhaps call it (Puget Sound Region) and <br>
then merge Snohomish, Island, Skagit & Whatcom Counties into a new <br>
Region 8 (Northwest WA)?<br>
<br>
The rationale to pull these two counties out of the fold would be to <br>
reduce the size of the current list of boxes when you upload Region <br>
2.<br>
<br>
Another idea would be to list Pierce and King Counties as two <br>
individual distinct regions (Puget Sound South & Puget Sound North).<br>
<br>
I wanted to throw the ideas out there to see if there was any <br>
interest in it.  I'd be willing to work on it over the next couple <br>
of months. I may even create a poll to see where folks want to go <br>
with it.<br>
<br>
Please chime in.  I foresee that pulling out these two 'LB populous' <br>
regions may affect some of the mystery boxes as they're currently <br>
listed--so it might cause a little 'maintenance' effort for a few <br>
folks who have mystery boxes out there.  Hopefully, though the <br>
effort will make Region 2 a bit more manageable to deal with--<br>
especially for folks just 'discovering' letterboxing these days.<br>

Sounds good to me . . . it can't hurt to section it out too much, can it?  I<br>
organize the clues by area - the smaller the master list the better for us.<br>
Heck you could divide it by county and we'd be ok with it!!<br>
<br>
Thank you for sending trip updates - I learned some things.  I can't help be<br>
amazed and somewhat in awe of your adventures with the kids.  Lucky, lucky<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like a very good idea.  As a newbie I recall thinking the map<br>
seemed a bit imprecise.  I think most Western Washington people think<br>
along the lines you suggest.<br>
<br>
Another suggestion, put the break between 1 and 2 in the middle of the<br>
sound.  For me, once a ferry ride is involved, it's a totally<br>
different trip planning wise.  Bainbridge my be 5 miles from me as the<br>
crow flies, but it's much "further" psychologically than Cougar<br>
Mountain.<br>

I'd leave 1, 3-7 alone (unless there are some major problems folks <br>

reach it may make it naturally fit with the Olympic Peninsula <br>

<br>
The deal is that the boxes are listed by regions based on their <br>
counties--so that would have to be how the regions are delineated.  <br>
It's funny--Pierce County continues across the Sound into parts <br>
adjacent to Kitsap so there will always be a tad bit of confusion <br>
for the Gig Harbor area boxes, as well. <br>

<br>
I tried to send this message, but my computer crashed just as I hit <br>
send, so I don't think it went through...?<br>
<br>
I think the Olympic Peninsula is a natural place to put Kitsap <br>
County - at least it makes more sense to me than putting it with the <br>
Seattle metro area.<br>
<br>
I also like the idea of splitting up Puget Sound, but I might suggest <br>
a slightly different division.  It has always seemed a bit strange to <br>
me that Tacoma was in a different region than Olympia - but that the <br>
Olympia boxes are in with the ones from Vancouver and Longview.<br>
<br>
If it were up to me, I might propose splitting Puget Sound into:<br>
<br>
2a - South Sound - Thurston and Pierce counties<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
2b - North Sound - King and Snohomish counties<br>
<br>
You could still collect Whatcom, Skagit, Island, and San Juan <br>
counties into a new area 8 - Northwest WA.<br>
<br>
Looking at an uncluttered map of the counties might be helpful for <br>
those visual learners out there:<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Over the years, I'd been thinking about merging Pierce & Thurston <br>
Counties, too--it just seems logical.  Just wondering if, as LB <br>
grows in popularity, each of these Puget Sound area counties may <br>
eventually need their own regions--because these counties' letterbox <br>
populations could conceivably grow quite a bit (check out the <br>
geocaching site and see the 100s of caches in the area)?  <br>
<br>
I'm game for merging Pierce and Thurston, separating out King <br>
completely, possibly merging it with Snohomish.  <br>
<br>
We'll play with the map image a bit and see how it'll look.  Once we <br>
have the map image set, then I'll send it to the 'magicians' who <br>
have the software that can 'map' the hyperlinks to it.<br>
<br>
Anybody from the other regions see any major problems with their <br>
maps/regions?  Want any other cities listed?  We're trying to keep <br>
it streamlined but if there are any glaring omissions let me know <br>
and we'll fix it.<br>

<br>
The major problem with that map, though, is that it's incorrect--the <br>
county 'overlay' doesn't jive with the actual land versus water <br>
map.  Olympia is actually on the water as are Seattle and Tacoma--<br>
the census map doesn't reflect that.  In fact, it looks like this <br>
was the map that was originally used for the LBNA site. The other <br>
counties' borders seem to be alright--but the Puget Sound region is <br>
off big time--scary because that's where most of the population is <br>
located. Now, I'm curious how accurate the census info is, as <br>
well.  ;)<br>

Other than that, I don't really have any recommendations. =)<br>

***********************************<br>
<br>
This is where we're leaning on revamping the WA map regions:<br>
<br>
** Create new individual regions out of these counties (as they have <br>
the potential to 'explode' exponentially at any moment):<br>
<br>
Thurston<br>
Pierce<br>
King<br>
<br>
** Merge the remaining NW WA counties (Snohomish, Island, San Juan, <br>
Skagit and Whatcom) into their own region<br>
<br>
** Merge Kitsap County with the Olympic Peninsula region.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Questions for discussion:<br>
<br>
Should Snohomish merge with King County, individually or with the other <br>
NW WA counties?  Snohomish doesn't currently have many boxes but it <br>
does have the landmass to potentially support a plethora of them.<br>
<br>
Does anybody from the Vancouver/PDX area see a need to separate Clark <br>
County (since it too has gobs of boxes) into its own individual region?<br>
<br>
Should we break the counties out individually--Thurston, Pierce and <br>
King?  Thurston's not so big--Pierce is big but half the land is non-<br>
boxable due to NPS lands, glaciers or military installations--so <br>
merging the two is fine with me.  King's large and quite populated and <br>
much of it is potentially 'boxable'.  Snohomish is large but not as <br>
populated as King.  I don't mind merging King & Snohomish or just <br>
keeping Snohomish with the other NW counties.<br>
