                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd mount it the way i mount the white stuff, on a small block of wood.  I usually work with 1x3 or 1x4, but Mischief_Wa works in 1/2 x 3, so it's really a question of thick you want your base to be.<br/>
<br/>
I mount with Gorilla glue -- but make sure to use WAY less then you think you should and let it dry OVERNIGHT and on a *completly* flat surface (my first tries weren't and there was some SERIOUS slippage).  I use a heavy grit sandpaper to sand down the sawn edges (yea, i'm using a hand saw and a miter box) and a fine grit to smooth the surface.  I sand before I glue.<br/>
<br/>
I also stamp the image on the back of the wood (with a dark ink) and then verathane the crap out of it (i actually use a water-based polyurathane as it won't yellow that way).  I've used both a spray can and a paint brush approach -- the latter is actually unexpectedly easier (thanks, Mischief!)<br/>
<br/>
That's about it!<br/>
