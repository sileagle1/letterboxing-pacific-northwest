whatever, where you realized AFTER you got home that there had been a <br>
letterbox there?"<br>
<br>
Mine was Wauna Viewpoint.  Kitty and I took a last minute trip out there last <br>
October and hiked to the top (which was no small feat for me with my fear of <br>
heights), but had been in such a hurry to get out the door that I'd neglected to <br>
search for a LB there.  Sure enough, when I got home, I found out that Double <br>
Tree herself had one planted up there.<br>
