                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got my one and only trail exchange while going out to one of my <br/>
boxes to retrieve the Molly Looking for Ginger HH that was left there <br/>
for us to get. The people we exchanged with were looking for their <br/>
first box and got their first stamp, first HH, and first exchange all <br/>
at once!<br/>
<br/>
For those who weren't around a few years back I created the Ginger <br/>
Looking For Molly HH and Chuck in Conn. created the Molly Looking for <br/>
Ginger HH. Ginger being our dog and Molly his. The goal of each HH was <br/>
to travel across the country to reach the other. Both managed to make <br/>
it across at approximately the same time, mine making it in time for <br/>
the Molly Day gathering in Conn. and his making it in time for the <br/>
Milo McIver Gathering in Oregon. Both were then sent back and retired.<br/>
<br/>
The day I found Ryan's Crappy Stamp box, I noted that Funhog had <br/>
stamped in on the same day. I thought about roaming the trails <br/>
screaming "Funhog!" out at the tops of my lungs in case she was still <br/>
in the area but then I heard a Harley rev in the distance and knew the <br/>
opportunity had past.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My favorite trail exchange of the two that I've had, <br/>
happened in Arizona a couple of years ago. I go <br/>
to Tucson every February for business but somehow <br/>
always manage to squeeze in some letterboxing <br/>
while I'm there. Up until that time my boxing usually <br/>
consisted of hiding a letterbox since there were so<br/>
few in the area and I had long since exhausted the <br/>
supply. Well, some time in 2003 AZRoadie appeared <br/>
on the local scene and started hiding boxes right and <br/>
left. <br/>
<br/>
Having a newbie on the scene, I was pretty darned <br/>
excited to meet up. We emailed and made plans to <br/>
have coffee together on Monday morning. On Sunday, <br/>
I decided to go birding at a wonderful place about an <br/>
hour east of Tucson, San Pedro House. There also <br/>
happened to be one of AZRoadie's boxes hidden there. <br/>
It was the perfect way to kill a box and a bird with the <br/>
proverbial one stone.<br/>
<br/>
Once I figured out that this boxer's degrees given in <br/>
his clue weren't compass bearings but degrees on a <br/>
circle, I managed to track down the letterbox. As I was <br/>
walking away from the hiding place to stamp in, a <br/>
bearded fellow came up to me, looked at the letterbox <br/>
and said, "Are you a letterboxer?" I looked at him and <br/>
answered "Are you AZRoadie?" Sure nuff... we met on the <br/>
trail, a day early and far, far from town.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, he and his wife made a trip to Oregon last <br/>
year. You may recognize his Route 66 sig stamp in the <br/>
local logbooks. They created an amazing scrapbook to<br/>
commemorate their trip complete with maps, photos and<br/>
all the stamps they collected, INCLUDING the ever-elusive<br/>
Oxbow #4, the box with no clue!  Funhog<br/>
