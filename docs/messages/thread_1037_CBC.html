the area occurred.  My partner this weekend did Whidbey Island last <br>
weekend.<br>
<br>
I don't keep up on the birding news.  In our little territory we have <br>
a hard time because it is not a glamor spot.  Hard to get volunteers <br>
to help survey such glamor spots as Boeing Field, Georgetown and <br>
Allentown.<br>
<br>
We usually get a very respectable Crow, Starling and house sparrow <br>
count.  We get mini surprises like 18 Downey Woodpeckers at one spot <br>
and a Clark's Grebe on the Duwamish.  <br>
<br>
Often an article will appear in a quarter or so giving discussion of <br>
the regional and national trends.<br>
<br>
It will be a long wet day.<br>
<br>
Its all good.<br>
