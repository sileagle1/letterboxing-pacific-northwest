                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not sure anyone noticed that I was gone, but I'm back after a fun <br/>
time in Portland.  Thanks to those that came out to visit while I was <br/>
in the area!  It was a lot of fun!  =)<br/>
<br/>
As for letterboxing updates....  <br/>
<br/>
I headed out to check up on the Murder at Gabriel Park series, and <br/>
learned that two of the boxes were missing.  And a third box couldn't <br/>
be found since one of the missing boxes led to it.  Anyhow, I <br/>
replaced the missing boxes and all six are now up for grabs!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Tualatin Hills Nature Park Series: Three of the boxes were still <br/>
there.  Two of them I carved replacements for and rehid, so the first <br/>
five are now back in action.  However, due to changes in topography, <br/>
I've altered the original hiding places and will have to see about <br/>
getting the clues updated to reflect the fact.  Who's the official <br/>
owner of these clues?  The last three boxes of the series are <br/>
definitely missing.<br/>
<br/>
In case you can't wait--Box #1 is almost at the same place, but I put <br/>
the box in the stump on the right side of the trail instead of where <br/>
it used to be behind the stump on the left side of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Box #5--follow the given clues until you find yourself on the <br/>
Ponderosa Loop.  Keep walking until you reach a bench.  The box is in <br/>
the large stump behind the bench.  Of all the boxes in this park, <br/>
this is the ONLY ONE left that has my VERY FIRST, original signature <br/>
stamp.  Most of you probably know about the purple spider sig stamp <br/>
which I used for several months, but this signature stamp predates <br/>
even that one!  =)  As far as I know, it's the only box left with <br/>
this original signature stamp in it.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And, as was already reported, Pooch Place is definitely missing.  I'd <br/>
love to carve a replacement since it was such a wonderful stamp.  And <br/>
also replacements for the rest of the Tualatin Hills Nature Park <br/>
series.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, I headed out to Silver Falls for a quick check on some of <br/>
the boxes.  Two are definitely missing.  One that was reported as <br/>
missing I didn't get a chance to check up on.  And Frenchie Falls I <br/>
couldn't even look for since I didn't bring the clues in English.  <br/>
*rolling eyes*  But at least 7 of the Silver Falls Series are <br/>
definitely there as of Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
I'll still need to update the clue page for that series, though, so <br/>
you'll have to wait a day or two to find out which ones are alive and <br/>
well and which ones are really missing.<br/>
<br/>
Carpe diem!<br/>

It should be either Green Hornet or Wingnut. Pooch's Place is one of<br/>
the boxes that Ranger Kyle definitely objected to. The possibility of<br/>
replacement could be a topic of discussion at the Roadhouse Gathering<br/>
Dec. 6th. I'm sure a different hiding place would be necessary. The<br/>
other offending boxes are the ones at Fanno Creek, although I know<br/>

<br/>
&gt;And Frenchie Falls I couldn't even look for since I didn't bring the<br/>

<br/>
Quelle Domage! Anyone who goes to find this one best be sure that they<br/>
have the Nouveau version of the clue as the original hiding place is<br/>
no more. Funhog AKA Le Cochon Badine<br/>

I am the Nature Park guy...  they were originally hidden for a letterbox<br/>
class the Nature Park hired me to teach.  From there, we were given a table<br/>
at their Earth Day party and the series was expanded.  In anticipation of<br/>
this first event, Paisley Orca hid a great batch of boxes in the Park.  It<br/>
was later that the Park Ranger took exception with these boxes and asked for<br/>
them to be removed.  They thought the boxes were too far off the paths and<br/>
would encourage off-trail hiking.  I later toured the park with a ranger and<br/>
she gave her opinions on the hiding spots for all of my boxes.<br/>
Interestingly, as we walked, she showed me several trails leading off the<br/>
established routes &amp; told me that they were probably geocaches.  She said<br/>
that they didn't mind either on the property, but would like to be contacted<br/>
by the placer so they could get a nod of approval.  Their big concern is<br/>
people going off trail.<br/>

Now how could he object to it--he couldn't possibily be 100% certain <br/>
where the box was if it wasn't there to be found!  The clue is so <br/>
vague.  Unless he's the one that pulled the box....?<br/>

But still, I could see why he'd object to that box.  A new hiding <br/>
place would kind of ruin the clue, though.  I fear this box might <br/>
have to die.<br/>

It's not so much nature-protection that Kyle would have a problem <br/>
with, I think.  I'd agree on that count.  It's not creating new <br/>
trails or trampling vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
I think on this box, it's more of a safety concern.  It is an awkward <br/>
box to reach and I found myself leaning quite a ways over the rail to <br/>
reach where the box was.  Most of us are smart enough to use the tree <br/>
to support ourselves and not fall over, but I can imagine why he'd be <br/>
concerned about people falling over while trying to reach the box.<br/>

Keep in mind that his standard of acceptable hiding place is one "that<br/>
you would feel safe allowing a five year old to find by themsleves"<br/>
I'm paraphrasing what he told me. He also said that one of the hiding<br/>
places he's found and objects to is an active animal burrow. I'm not<br/>

&gt; The clues were put in my name, then Tom emailed me.... I think all<br/>
&gt; you need to do is contact the webmaster (of the clues), I emailed<br/>
&gt; them and told them you were taking it Tom, I don't believe they had<br/>
&gt; an email to switch it too for you...  :) Wingnut<br/>

I am such a dork...  I have been a webmaster for the LbNA site for just<br/>
about as long as it has been up and running.  I was transferring California<br/>
boxes onto the new database and spaced on moving all of my own!!!<br/>

&gt; Quelle Domage! Anyone who goes to find this one best be sure that they<br/>
&gt; have the Nouveau version of the clue as the original hiding place is<br/>
&gt; no more. Funhog AKA Le Cochon Badine<br/>

Recently, I have managed to check on several of my letterboxes. Bishop's Close and <br/>
Discovery Trail are both nestled in their damp homes awaiting new visitors. The book <br/>
at Discovery Trail is full but I didn't have one to fit the box with me. Take paper! The <br/>
ever elusive Hidden Dragon is very lonely but still resting in his den on Sauvie Island. <br/>
The Carty box at Ridgefield NWR is back in action with a replacement.  <br/>
<br/>
The trail at Ridgefield has changed since my original hide. The revised clue is up and <br/>
running at LbNA. This is the best time of year to hunt for this box if you have even a <br/>
passing interest in wildlife. The tundra swans and sandhill cranes are on the refuge. <br/>
Since the trees have no leaves, you have a much better chance of seeing some of the <br/>
resident bald eagles. We even spotted one with a kill in its talons on Thursday!<br/>
<br/>
Once this ice melts, get away from that computer and go find a letterbox! Maybe we'll <br/>
meet on the trail. Funhog<br/>
