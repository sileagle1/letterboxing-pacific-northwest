We are moving sight unseen, which is a bit scary to say the least, <br/>
and though we are dissatisfied with our present situation (do you <br/>
realize how RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE houses are here?), it is familiar <br/>

something, that the change will do us good.<br/>
<br/>
So why am I writing all this here you ask? Well, my husband and I<br/>
(and our 9 month old daughter) just started letterboxing about 5 <br/>
months ago. The three of us wander around on nice Saturday mornings <br/>
searching for clues and boxes and having a ball doing it. Having <br/>
Maggie with us has proven to be very useful. She's a great cover <br/>
when we stop to grab a box and greatly distacts attention away from <br/>
us with her winning smile and beguiling ways! :-)And now we are <br/>
moving right when we are starting to get the hang of this whole <br/>
Letterboxing thing. A new area. New lands. New sights. New smells. <br/>
How exciting and frightening. <br/>
<br/>
I am a firm believer in having nets in place whenever doing <br/>
something new - just in case. A net in this case would be <br/>
information of all kinds. Anyone done anything like this before? Any <br/>
advice for us? How is moving with a babe? What is the Seattle area <br/>
like? Any areas to stay away from? To buy or to rent? Anyone <br/>
interested in starting up a convo. or a giving a tour (tee-hee)?<br/>
Oh, and of course, what boxes should we look for once we are settled?<br/>
What hikes will take us on magic journeys in the area?....and on and <br/>
on.... And so I turn to you, PNW Letterboxing community, to morph <br/>
yourselves into a net of sorts for my family and me.<br/>
<br/>
Could you? Would you?<br/>
<br/>
Our thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Dear Up-rooted Family,<br/>
  My husband, daughter and I made the same decision you have 4 years <br/>
ago and have not regretted a single moment. I lived in Southern <br/>
California for 38 years, born and raised there, and had a split <br/>
second opportunity to move away from there and live in Portland Or. <br/>
We left our entire families in So. CA. and packed everthing we owned <br/>
in a UHaul truck and took off and have never looked back. I believe <br/>
it was the best decision we have ever made. We too tried to buy a <br/>
home in CA. which was impossible and the area was not suited for <br/>
raising kids. I can honestly say that you could not pay me enough to <br/>
go back and live in CA. The Pacific Northwest is a totally different <br/>
world. The people are so much nicer, the traffic better, the air is <br/>
clean, mind you it does rain more here but the scenery is beautiful <br/>
when it stops raining, and the letterboxes are unending! We have been <br/>
to the most beautiful places that I have ever seen and met some of <br/>
the greatest people on the planet (of course I mean my fellow <br/>
letterboxers). We were able to buy a brand new home in Battle Ground, <br/>
WA. so I recommend buying instead of renting, and the schools are <br/>
some of the best in the country. I live about 3 hours South of <br/>
Seattle and I am not the one to ask about letterboxes in the area but <br/>
I am sure the wonderful letterbox community where you are will <br/>
contact you soon and welcome you to the area. In my opinion you have <br/>
made the right decision and you will not regret it in the least! My <br/>
daughter is 9 years old and was not a baby when we moved so the best <br/>
advice I can give you is to take your time, enjoy the scenery and <br/>
don't look back. Good luck on your journey and think of it as <br/>
starting your life over anew. Keep your mind open to new experiences <br/>
and your eyes open to all the beauty around you and you will be <br/>
amazed by what you find. After 4 years I still feel like everything <br/>
is brand new and I am loving every minute of it! I hope to meet you <br/>
at a gathering some day to see how you and your family are faring in <br/>
this beautiful part of the world. Happy Trails!<br/>
