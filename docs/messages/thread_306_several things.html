officially the first finders, but a certain you-know-who's stamp was there ahead <br/>
of us.  (Resistance is futile.)<br/>
<br/>
Heather &amp; I are going to Milo McIver tomorrow to scope out the planting <br/>
possibilities.  Between us, we should have 10 new boxes in place in time for the <br/>
gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
Housekeeping news: I should mention that I had pulled my April Fools box from <br/>
the clue list.  Alas, as reported earlier, the only thing left in the <br/>
hidey-place was the lid!  I fear a similar fate should I replace it, so I bid the <br/>
fool goodbye and wish him well, whereever he may now be.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, if you go a-hunting for my Ap* Cave box at Mount St H*lens, also <br/>
check out TreeMan's "Where were you when the mountain blew" LB (and the lonely <br/>
"Eagle Cliff" box--altho before going for that one you might check the archives <br/>
for my e-mail about how much the area has changed since it was planted.)<br/>
<br/>
That's it, I think.<br/>
