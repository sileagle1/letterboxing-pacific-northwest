Gwendolyn was so lonesome she almost didn't let me leave, she said she had heard of a new sheriff in the wood, but hadn't seen him yet, thou' excited at the prospect.<br>

The Woodland Gnome was looking forward to Spring and time start chopping next winter's wood so it can dry.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The Forest Gnome wanted to know why he hears people going past wondering at the number of the last trail marker.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
And Jarl, well you know Jarl, always with the basket and talking about new shoulder pads.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Point Defiance # 1 was still talking about the last visitor and how well hidden and snug he felt, while # 2 lamented at the solitude.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Camp Six hadn't been able hear anything since all the Santa Train activity, but was getting better and looking forward to Spring and some new fern fronds, said the roof leaked.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Pt. D. Bear was grumpy as ever, having been wakened from hibernation. He said "cover me well and natural please!"<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The Sports Series was the hardest to catch, having had a recent visitor, the first two were running all over the place talkin' about it, except for number three who was still smiling at the confusion of the last sport to come by, he said  "I had 'em on the hook, but couldn't reel 'em in!"<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
So, if it's on the Web Site, it's in the 'wood.<br>

I take it Gwendolyn's gotten over her gallavanting Travelin' Man.  <br>
Last thing I heard, he'd made his way out to Syracuse, NY but had had <br>
a run in with the wrong crowd--sort of gave him the run around with a <br>
beating to boot!  Boy, does that man sure get around.  I figured poor <br>
Gwendolyn was still feeling stumped that he left her...  Perhaps some <br>
new perfume might suit her well?  Or was that 'odor' free she <br>
preferred???  ;) <br>
<br>
Perhaps she'll find meet some new friends who can cheer her up in a <br>
few weeks???  Hopefully, she won't miss the party.  The next one <br>
won't come around for another four years or so...<br>

Two Nails made an attempt at #1 & #2 but got frustrated (as per <br>
usual with a T&N/Evil series).  Seems we found the 2nd square broken <br>
off and thrown into the woods.  Never did locate its original <br>
position to look 70.  Oh bother, maybe next time.  <br>
<br>
Decided to cut our losses early and head down to Titlow.  Found the <br>
Humminbird nest but it was empty! :(  Someone must have disturbed <br>
its resting place.  Black box was broken and nothing inside.  <br>
Located the Bald Eagle still in great shape, dry and lonely since <br>
having some Mischief in Jan of 03.  Glad to add a couple more stamps <br>
to the log book.  <br>
<br>
Walked a little further and checked on our Titlow Beach box too.  <br>
Found it in poor shape.  Box is broken and log book is soaked <br>
(again).  We will replace the box and log book in time for the <br>
Leap.  Very surprised this one hasnt floated out to sea.  <br>
<br>
All in all not too bad a day.  Didnt get rained on and added one <br>
stamp to our book.  Better one than none.  Looking forward to a trip <br>
back to the Point soon.<br>

We found this one this past weekend. WE thought we had it found when <br>
at the viewpoint..but it was the wrong first square..I will say that <br>
there is a perfect hiding spot at this viewpoint that lines up with <br>
the coordinates given in the clue when you count the wrong type <br>
of "square" shapes!!<br>
<br>
It was a bit tough since the final trail marker was recently broken <br>
off at the ground. Some walker/jogger had leaned it against a tree. <br>
We were informed by a runner that happened to run by us which trail <br>
was the correct trail for the marker (I guess we looked lost) and <br>
that someone had broken off the marker this past few weeks.  When <br>
checking the coordinates at where the marker now rests..it is way <br>
off!! (The marker was broken off flush with the ground..we looked for <br>
remnants for 20 minutes.) But..we rooted around and found the <br>
box...MomNoTime actually stepped on the box when she was trying to be <br>
subtle looking as a hiker walked past. You should of seen her face <br>
when she did that!! Thank goodnes the ground is spongy!! The stamp <br>
had some kind of "film/particles" on it and we had to rub that off so <br>
that the ink would stay on the stamp. <br>
<br>
Well..when I replanted the box...where we found it...I took a bearing <br>
and there is a marker way, way, way yonder that lines up perfectly <br>
with the box... one must be practically lying on the ground to see <br>
the marker. THen when I hiked to the marker itself and looked towards <br>
the box I noticed that you can't see the location at all until one <br>
lies on the ground and even then...it's near impossible unless you <br>
know what you are looking for! LOL!!<br>
