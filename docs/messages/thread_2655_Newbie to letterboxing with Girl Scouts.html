<br/>
I am a Girl Scout leader and would like to take my girls on a couple <br/>
of these.  They seem like they would be fun for the kids and in <br/>
talking to the girls, they liked the idea as kind of like a treasure <br/>
hunt.  We are in the Seattle area (Capitol Hill to be exact).  So my <br/>
question to y'all would be what trips would you recommend and why?  My <br/>
girls are 3rd - 5th grade kids.  I would help them, although I want <br/>
them to really figure it out themselves.  We would prefer to do ones <br/>
that cost us little to no money and I would prefer them to be <br/>
outdoors.  We would be able to get our hands on some compasses.  I've <br/>
been to both the Atlas and the Letterboxing websites, but don't know <br/>
which ones are too easy or which ones would be most fun.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't know the boxes in Seatle, but I would suggest that you <br/>
research the hikes, where they are at, the length etc, and chose <br/>
along the guide lines of what the girls will enjoy.  I have a 3 yr <br/>
old boy and a 9yr old girl and my daughter is very good at finding <br/>
most of the boxes.  I also find that a 3 mile round trip is the max <br/>
that I can do with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Chose a box or series that will hold interest for them, like a <br/>
botanica garden where they will learn about plants as well, or a <br/>
hike to a waterfall, or something that will teach a little history.<br/>
<br/>
It is all good, just have fun, and they wont even realize that they <br/>
are getting exercise and learning.<br/>
