Wow what a day! Sandi and I packed up the 2 mutts and drove to <br/>
euegene yesterday. Along the way we got Rambopups "Dig dog" LB at the <br/>
Metzhill I-5 rest area and was alive and well. We went to find <br/>
her "Cow creek" rest are box but realized too late that according to <br/>
the exit number, it was nowhere near cow creek (there are no rest <br/>
areas there) and realized that it was actually back near Glendale. <br/>
That was a bit disspointing, but we will get it on our next trip. <br/>
  Then we traveled onto Roseburg for "easter joy". This one I <br/>
seriously reccomend, the view was amazing. Freezing cold, but hey, it <br/>
is february. What a great place though :o)  <br/>
  We then went to find the UofO LB and got to question #10 and <br/>
realized that I forgot to print up the 2nd part of the clues... darn <br/>
I felt stupid. Beutiful campus though. I felt really stupid though <br/>
when I had to ask someone how to use a parking meter. <br/>
  So from there we went to CymruWitch's Rhododenron box at Hendricks <br/>
park, what a beautiful park, I loved all the ivy :o) and a <br/>
beautifully unique logbook. The LB is alive and well but quite <br/>
visible on the trail so we tried to tuck it a littler further under <br/>
the log into the ivy. At this point I started feeling really sick, <br/>
gee who knew the flu could come on so fast? which unfortunately this <br/>
shortened our trip... <br/>
   So then we went to Skinner Butte to find, what else, but the <br/>
Skinner Butte LB and also the Sisters LB. At the bottom of the road I <br/>
was really excited to see columnar jointing, something I had studied <br/>
in geology classes but had never seen up close, that was really <br/>
awesome :o) So anyways we went up there and got the Sisters box and <br/>
fed and watered the dogs and tooks some pictures and walked to find <br/>
the Skinner butte box. At this point my dog ran down the hill and <br/>
rolled in something very dead and very rotten and when I called him <br/>
back to me I grabbed his collar to hook on his leash and put my hand <br/>
in something chunky and slimy and like an idiot, smelled my hand to <br/>
see what it was and immediatly started dry heaving violently for <br/>
about 10 minutes and Sandi, being the great friend she is, laughed so <br/>
hard she nearly wet herself (I wish she would have). Well when i <br/>
finally stopped dry heaving I sat down and stamped into Skinner butte <br/>
LB, another creative stamp and logbook by CymruWitch. <br/>
    So then we were planning to go straight to Alton Baker Park for <br/>
that series, but had to stop at the first river I found to throw <br/>
mydog in it. He had the time of his life chasing ducks (he is a <br/>
retriever after all) and through this he got off most of the chunky <br/>
slimy stinky stuff on him. So then, feeling even sicker now, we went <br/>
to Alton Baker park, another really amazing park, and went to find <br/>
this series. Box number one was MIA so much to our dissapointment we <br/>
tried to locate box #2 which was also MIA and then it was getting <br/>
dark and I was getting sicker, not too mention the smell of my dog <br/>
was quite unpleasant, and we knew that #4 was MIA as listed on the <br/>
website, and so we figured in 1 and 2 were also MIA, #3 was probably <br/>
gone too so we turned around headed back to the truck. <br/>
   From here we went to Mount Pisgah Park to locate those LB's but we <br/>
hadnt hiked very far into the woods when it got really dark really <br/>
fast and my lungs were hurting me reeeaally bad and then the flu hit <br/>
me like a bag of bricks so we turned around and headed back tot eh <br/>
truck for the long drive home.<br/>
   I have never seen so much of Euegene before and was rather <br/>
impressed, I especially loved the beautiful parks and the people were <br/>
very polite and UofO had a lot of very very good looking guys. We got <br/>
a total of 5 LBs so it was a good trip, with the exception of me <br/>
getting sick, but at least when we go back there we will be more <br/>
familiar with the area and get more LBs. It was alot of fun, had a <br/>
great day (most of it). We are looking forward to going back up <br/>
there :o)<br/>

Wow! gone are the days of one letterbox in Eugene and none between there and Grants <br/>
Pass. I do need to make a journey that direction myself. Take care of yourself and keep <br/>
on planting! Funhog<br/>
