to say the feelings are mutual, but, you'd have never known about mine, I<br/>
tend to keep unfounded perceptions of people I've never met in real life to<br/>
myself, realizing that the medium I've 'met' that person in here in<br/>
cyberspace, is less than conducive to getting to know the real person.<br/>
<br/>
I assume that I've done something horrible and really, really annoying to<br/>
you to get you so irritated at me.  I most humbly apologize to the King of<br/>
Letterboxing (As you were first introduced to me as) if my actions, words or<br/>
anything else, have upset, irritated, or bothered you in any manner.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to carry this conversation further, feel free to contact me<br/>
offlist, otherwise, put a sock in it.<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day!<br/>
