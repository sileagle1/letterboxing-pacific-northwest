These are the ones I know about:<br>
<br>
The Spirit of Dartmoor (Portland)--It's a mystery box, so I can't tell you where in Portland, but saying it's indoors probably won't spoil it.<br>
<br>
Aces of Fun (Portland)--Same story, a mystery box, so I can't tell you what type of place it's hidden in.<br>
<br>
Walking Tour (San Luis Obispo, CA)--I guess you could say it's a mystery box, but it's my box so I feel no guilt in saying that I hid it in a bookstore.  You still won't find the box without figuring out the clue first.  =)<br>
<br>
Bookstore Box (San Luis Obispo, CA)--Another one of my boxes, but as you can probably tell from the name, it's hidden in a bookstore.<br>
<br>
There's another box in Frederick, Maryland, that's cleverly hidden in a library.  (Sorry, I don't remember the name of the box off the top of my head.)<br>
<br>
I started working on a box that I was going to hide in a stamp store, and even have a clue ready for it, but I've heard rumors that somebody else beat me to it.  =(   I don't know what the box is called, though, since I haven't looked on the letterboxing website for new clues in several months.  (It's in San Luis, though.)<br>
<br>
And those are all the ones that I know about personally--either because I've found them or hid them.  There are plenty of others out there, though!  (Libraries and bookstores really seem to be a hotbed of letterboxing activities, though.)<br>

My Wallace Books letterbox is indoors at 7241 SE Milwaukie Ave., Portland (in <br>
Sellwood/Moreland).  As with other letterbooks, the book itself is the <br>
box--with a hollowed out space that holds the stamp and log.  <br>
<br>
In addition to puzzling out the clues to figure out where in the store the <br>
letterbook is located, you get the added bonus of reading my rant on the value <br>
of independent bookstores.<br>
