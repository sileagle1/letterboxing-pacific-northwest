&gt;I'm just posting in order to use this new rich text editor. I'm wondering if this will be useful to help solve some of the problems we see with certain posts having messed up formatting. I see there is a way to link to URLs too. Pretty nice. I'll bet some clever person will use this new feature to make some clues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Try this URL <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Was that cool? I hope to see you on the trails!<br/>

Didn't see anything for the URL there, was it to be a link?<br/>
