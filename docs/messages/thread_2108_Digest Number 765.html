 <br>
Hey, I'm looking for Ryan.  Does anyone know his whereabouts?  I went a-huntin' for his African Series Lion on Mt. Defiance the other day only to find that the box had been removed and its contents scattered.  Hubby-Doug was lucky enough to find the stamp... cold and homeless, but intact.  I'd like to fix the lion back up with a new logbook and lion's den, but I wanted to make sure that was alright with Ryan.  I emailed the Green Tortuga, but haven't received a response.  I just thought maybe getting the word out over the listserve might conjure up a response from the man himself.<br>
 <br>
Thanx!!!<br>

For those of you who were not aware, the Little Happiness Letterbox <br>
has been missing since 2003! I was not aware until someone emailed me <br>
just the other day that it was gone and only the crocodile box was <br>
still there. So Ryan carved a replacement stamp and I went today to <br>
replace the letterbox! And I had been recommending that one to <br>
everybody as one of the best Seattle area boxes! Wow<br>
<br>
Well, the gorgeous stamp is back and with an appropriately Asian <br>
themed logbook. <br>
Enjoy!<br>
