                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I checked out the new Daily 0 geocache, as listed in the article, one finder reported that there was a letterbox three feet away.  So looked on the New list, had to expand it to more entries, and there it was, placed the same day.  Got the clues and headed out to find it after work.  Great park (you know the kind, drive by it often, haven't been there to check it out) with good trails and information explaining what you were seeing and hearing.  Great Clues, if you believed them.  Found the box, great stamp, well done, Jess!!!<br/>
<br/>
The GC was under the other side of the log!  Some good stuff, several finders already, but none logged into the Lying Man.<br/>
<br/>
One of the finders  comments and in the log was that one group had bushwhacked in from Harrison Avenue, it was a tough go, but didn't recommend that anyone else try it, due to the damage it would cause to the wetlands.  Well, duh!!  If they were so concerned, why did they do it????<br/>
<br/>
Great clues, great stamp, interesting park, a must get!<br/>
