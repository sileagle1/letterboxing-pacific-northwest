On Saturday we tried to go find SANDY DELTA, but was unsuccessful <br/>
since we got started late and it got dark on us. WE will try again <br/>
when the kids are rested up. We wore them out with all the walking. <br/>
Then on Sunday we heade for JAYS TOOL BOX which was a fun find. We <br/>
hope to add a tool to it sometime. Then after that one we headed over <br/>
to INSTANT GRADIFICATION HOLIDAY. That was fun spinning the Dreidel. <br/>
We can't wait for the a new holiday stamp to be in there and we were <br/>
bummed we missed out on the first 2 months but hope not to miss <br/>
anymore. We are hooked once again on this sport we are heading out <br/>
after my husband gets home from work. We thought of a cool new <br/>
signature stamp for our family and hope to get it carved soon.WE keep <br/>
changing it but we hope that this one will be the one. Can't wait to <br/>
get it done. Well Happy Hunting everyone.<br/>
