me to annouce that there are still 7 Hitchhikers who are looking for <br/>
rides in the Seattle area. They are willing to go South and East in <br/>
their quest for the South Mountain Hitchhiker Hostel in Allentown PA.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining HH's are...<br/>
<br/>
Bon Jovi was last seen Rocking Out in Ravenna Park,<br/>
Poor little WWI Flying Ace is up a Creek without a Paddle in Schmitz <br/>
Park.<br/>
Captain Terror and Speed Racer struggling at a dead heat in Carkeek <br/>
Park!<br/>
By Leaps and Bounds was side tracked by a Turkey Dinner!<br/>
Dale Earnhardt had trouble in not one, but two (might they be Twin <br/>
Ponds?) Ponds.<br/>
Bon Jovi was last seen Rocking Out in Ravenna Park,<br/>
and<br/>
On the Run From Massachusetts is waiting for After the Story's End.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any help you can give these Racers to make their way across the <br/>
country is most appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
You can check their progress across the USA at:<br/>
