                    <div class="plaintext-content">YIKES!!!  I always want my clues to be easy and take people right to the<br>
letterboxes!!!  I'm sorry Cape Disappointment was such a....well,<br>
disappointment.  But then again, I do think that clue is a littler<br>
tougher than many of mine.  It's the python thing, I believe and I was<br>
lousier with a compass back when I placed it, so that could be a factor,<br>
as well.  Still, with some diligence, it apparently can be found.  North<br>
Head should be pretty easy.<br>
<br>
As for Bethany and her gushing about my stamps:  Thanks so much for the<br>
kind words.  Almost makes me feel like an artist or something.<br>
"Incredible"?  WOW!!!  What a compliment!  Thanks so much.  I was having<br>
a bad day and to read such a sweet thing posted to the list after a<br>
yucky day at work made me start to feel warm and fuzzy inside again.<br>
Thank you, thank you, thank you!<br>

Best regards,<br>
