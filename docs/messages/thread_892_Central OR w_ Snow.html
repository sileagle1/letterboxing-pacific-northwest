wouldn't be prudent to hang around 'til the afternoon to leave for<br/>
Portland. As it was, the east side of Mt Hood required chains and we<br/>
saw an upsidedown SUV down the embankment and a loaded pickup nose<br/>
down in the creek along the highway. (We stopped for both, but help<br/>
was already on its way.)<br/>

I tracked down the Fleshman's wonderful Lower Bridge letterbox Friday.<br/>
I feel as though I've won the Lb lottery. Not only are there new boxes<br/>
appearing regularly in Central OR but there are great stamps and<br/>
challenging clues to accompany them. This one is terrific.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was my day to leave a new box in the area. Most of the<br/>
stamps I have hidden there are my first attempts at carving and tend<br/>
to rank pretty high on the funk scale. Hopefully, my skills have<br/>
improved over the intervening months. Watch for the Odin Falls Angler<br/>
clue. Funhog<br/>

you didn't stick around.<br/>
