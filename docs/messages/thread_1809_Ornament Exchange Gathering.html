Hi! I wish I could have joined you all, it would have been fun to <br>
meet all of you :o) but unfortunately at my job I can't take off a <br>
weekend shift without being fired, lame, huh? but thats life I guess! <br>
Did anyone make and letterbox ornaments? or where they all just <br>
regular xmas ornaments? I was just wondering what ideas other LBers <br>
would have for making ornaments. We arent having a tree this year, <br>
our house is too small and I think it would really confuse my dog <br>
since he has never seen a christmas tree and it would be pretty awful <br>
if he "watered" the presents as a male dog might want to do! Does <br>
anyone have a funny christmas stories they would like to share? Heres <br>
mine if anyone would like to hear it, since its the christmas season <br>
and all :o)<br>
I bought my boyfriend Luke (our dogs name is also Luke) his present 2 <br>
months ago. He was desperatly wanting a pretty spendy gun (no he is <br>
not a hunter)and I was worried I wouldnt get it in time for xmas so I <br>
went ahead and ordered it from a local gunshop, well I thought it <br>
would take a few weeks to recieve like everything else you might <br>
order (4-8 weeks, 8-12, 12 to never) and it got there in 2 days. So I <br>
brought it home in the case and hid it in the house and drove to <br>
work, within 10 minutes he found it. (He saw me take the case in the <br>
house i guess and went looking as soon as I was gone.) You would <br>
think that being a letterboxer I would be good at hiding things! well <br>
my strategy was to hide it in such a horribly obvious place that he <br>
would never look there, and of course it was the first place he <br>
looked. duh. well he was so excited he stole the gun and replaced it <br>
(plastic wrapper and safety tags and all) with a plastic toy gun he <br>
spray painted that color and put it back in the too-darn-obvious <br>
hiding spot. Well he teased me later on that he took the gun out of <br>
the case and I told him he was lying and so the first chance I got I <br>
opened the case, saw a gun inside of it, and closed it and rehid it. <br>
Well I am not one who knows the first thing about guns so I didnt <br>
even bother to realize that it was a completely different (Plastic) <br>
gun in the case and figured Luke (the human) was just trying to get a <br>
rise out of me. Well the next night I came home from work and I saw a <br>
gun on the table and at first I was really dissapointed because I <br>
thought he had purchased it himself, the same gun i already bought <br>
him, and was bummed because it was expensive and non-returnable. So I <br>
asked him in a cute innocent voice "Where did you get that?" and he <br>
stuttered a bit and couldnt think of a lie fast enough I guess and <br>
admitted what he had done. Boy did i feel stupid when I opened up <br>
that gun case (for the second time) and picked up the gun inside of <br>
it and realized it didnt weigh anything (cuz its plastic!!). I <br>
couldnt believe it, he was so sneaky he put all the safety tags on <br>
the gun and re-wrapped it in the same plastic bag and everything! <br>
what a sneaky boy :o] So now i have to buy him anoooooother <br>
present.... and his shopping list isnt cheap! I better get a good <br>
present this year for putting up with him :o) Happy holidays <br>
Everyone!!!!!!!! :o)<br>

I have a mystery hidden in plain sight.  I think it is the best place<br>
to hide besides the shadows.<br>

together.  It was just the ticket to getting in the Christmas spirit!<br>
<br>
It was nice to meet Jade Cat and family as we've seen that cat stamp around<br>
for a while.  <br>
<br>
Thank you, CFL, Jade Cat and Willow for the creative ornaments.  Every time<br>
we meet with ya'all we learn something new.  That's all I'll say about<br>
that... but really, THANKS! <br>
<br>
Bye for now,<br>
