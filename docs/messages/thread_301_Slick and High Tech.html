Hey, I am sure that WE would look slick and high tech if Rubbermaid <br>
would put out small waterproof boxes just for letterboxing  AND if <br>
Master-carve and Speedball would package "letterboxing" kits and if <br>
Michaels and A.C. Moore would bankroll our website so that they could <br>
sell the stuff. <br>
Heck, I would buy it! :-)   I ENVY the geocachers and their slick <br>
stickers that they can put on their honking big boxes.  (although I <br>
think the whole decoding thing is a cop-out. What is the point of <br>
putting clues in code if all you have to do is click on the mouse to <br>
get the answer??)<br>
And I am out there buying the regalia. I appreciate the effort put <br>
into it by the Mohmers and all you guys.  But I do prefer the folk <br>
art aspect of the hobby. I prefer the homemade stamp as opposed to <br>
the store-bought stamp. I prefer the homemade book to the lined <br>
notepad. I prefer the intricate clever clues rather than the <br>
hitchhiker that is handed to me at a gathering. <br>
And this in not to say that I don't do all the easy things. I have <br>
hidden a store-bought stamp. I consistently use lined notepads and I <br>
am happy to stamp into a hitchhiker that is handed to me. :-) <br>
<br>
And geocaching might look all slick with the cool website and the <br>
gear and the stickers, but it's still a box of stuff from the dollar <br>
store. Stuff that is likely waterlogged and soggy (especially up here <br>
in the PNW). Yeah, yeah, I have heard about the boxes that have CD's <br>
and gameboy games and "expensive" stuff. But it's still just stuff. <br>
<br>
(but if you have any Letterboxing stuff to sell, I might be <br>
interested...:-)<br>
