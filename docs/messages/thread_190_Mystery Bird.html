Ok--so it's now been 2-1/2 years and I finally saw the mystery bird <br/>
again (this time a continent away from Seward Park, Seattle)!!!  <br/>
It's a Sand Hill Crane and I saw one today at the Children's Grand <br/>
Park in East Seoul!!!  Woo hoo!!!  Persistence pays off I <br/>
presume.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I'm still on the lookout for a Hoopoe in the wild.  I saw <br/>
a nature sign at the base of the Seoul Tower a couple of days ago <br/>
indicating that Hoopoe can be seen around here--now we're just <br/>
trying to keep our eyes open for one!  Til now, the only Hoopoe I've <br/>
seen in the wild has been a certain beautiful sig stamp in letterbox <br/>
logbooks around the Pacific Northwest!  ;)  See what tangents <br/>
letterboxing can take one on?<br/>

Sandhill Cranes??? You wanna see some Sandhill Cranes?!! Head for Kearney, <br/>
(pronounced car-knee) Nebraska mid March til mid April. 90% of the world's sandhills <br/>
rest there, fattening up for the long flight to their breeding grounds in the tundra. <br/>
Half a million (we're being literal here) cranes, not to mention the millions of snow <br/>
geese and assorted other waterfowl, flying out at first light is a sight to behold... Not <br/>
a hoopoe, but downright magnificent on its own. Funhog<br/>

As big as that bird was yesterday, I don't know if an ordinary <br/>
umbrella would protect against such an onslaught!!!  Maybe it should <br/>
be steel or concrete?<br/>

Sandhills are amazing birds and one of only two native North American <br/>
cranes ( whooping is the other)<br/>
<br/>
There many other crane species in pan-Asia.  Many of them are revered <br/>
for their fidelity to their mates.  The mating dances of these birds <br/>
are wonderful to see.  Ther are featured in many classic asian <br/>
artworks.<br/>
<br/>
Othello , in eastern Washington sponsors the Sandhill Crane Festival <br/>
every spring.  While numbers are not as great as the central flyway, <br/>
I had the experience of watching about 2000 birds approach up a long <br/>
vally and land on the cliff edge above us.  We could hear before we <br/>
saw them and it was an awsome sight ( and sound)<br/>
<br/>
There are no letterboxes in Othello but there are some near by ... <br/>
hint hint.<br/>
<br/>
Sandhills are rare on the west side of the Cascades in Washington.  I <br/>
did have a flock of 6 at the Kent Ponds one year.  They were in Fall <br/>
migration and pushed on after 1 day.  You can find them randomly in <br/>
the Spring on the west side of the Cascades in Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
hoopoes are more likely to be in India right now, but any place you <br/>
hang your hat<br/>
<br/>
