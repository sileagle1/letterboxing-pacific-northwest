Lantern, before he went missing.  It's a great series, and I love having the<br/>
collection.  I'm keeping an eye out for more!  And... should I go back to<br/>
some of the others, do you know?  That one surprise just made me giggle.  I<br/>
loved it!  (Being vague here in case you don't want details out.  But did<br/>
you ever find out who the culprit was?  Was that already brought up here?)<br/>
<br/>
The fallen hero will be remembered always in my logbook.<br/>
