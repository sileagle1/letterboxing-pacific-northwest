<br/>
Well now that someone else has mentioned an RV it's time to come out of the<br/>
closet!  We're RV campers.  That may be an unusual situation in the Lb<br/>
world.  I have health issues and tent camping is out of the question ....<br/>
just RV camping is hard enough!     LoL<br/>
<br/>
Sue4Stampin - when I checked a few days ago RV sites 3, 5, &amp; 7 were open.<br/>
We booked site #7 for the 1st and 2nd.  We decided to stay the 3rd and site<br/>
7 is booked so we'll move to site #17 for the last night.  Anyway 5 is right<br/>
next to 7 if you want Letterboxing for neighbors. Hopefully the site is<br/>
still available.  You can register online or by phone.<br/>
<br/>
Ladybug is planning to come and stay in our site.<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to meeting you all and seeing those folks we've previously met.<br/>
