Bald Eagle LB in Skagit County, WA <br>
(placed in honor of the last Bald Eagle Festival in Concrete, WA <br>
this past Spring)<br>
<br>
I presume at this moment this little letterbox is bobbing up and <br>
down somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, on its way to the Arctic Ocean <br>
at the moment (unless, of course, its little magnet was able to hold <br>
up to the forces of torrential rushing water!).  ;)  Fortunately, <br>
it's in a waterproof container so it will be quite interesting to <br>
possibly hear from it again sometime in the future--sort of like a <br>
message in a film canister?  Ironic, isn't it, that I carved this <br>
little fellow on a ferry ride so it's only fitting it also died in <br>
the water...  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, however, it was one of my favorite micro-stamps to <br>
date.  :(<br>
<br>
Happy bobbing little Eagle!  At least, you'll be much closer to your <br>
food source in the ocean...  ;)<br>

I waited till this summer to go, as she had pulled it last Fall for <br>
the flood season.  I am glad I went when I did.<br>

I hope she tries one more time.  It is a neat venue.<br>
