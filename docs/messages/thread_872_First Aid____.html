                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't carry a first aid kit for day hikes.  I figure things like <br/>
bandaids can wait until after I get back to my car.  At least I've <br/>
never heard of anyone dieing from not getting a bandaid on quick <br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
While backpacking on the AT I did carry a small kit of bandaids, <br/>
antisepectic stuff, moleskin, aspirin, and minor stuff like that <br/>
since it could be several days before I'd get into a town.  Also some <br/>
really small tweezers to get those blood sucking ticks off.  (Used <br/>
that a LOT in Virginia!)  I figured if the injury was more serious <br/>
than that, I'd have a bunch of rescuers carrying me out anyhow and <br/>
would probably bring lots of emergency medical supplies as well.  =)  <br/>
And if I was in even worse shape and died, well--then medical <br/>
supplies wouldn't matter much anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
I also had another theory while on the trail: A day never passed <br/>
where I didn't pass people that carried honking huge first aid kits <br/>
and if you needed a bandaid or something, there were always PLENTY of <br/>
people around that LOVED to be helpful.  Weekenders and day hikers <br/>
were famous on the trail for carrying all sorts of extra unnecessary <br/>
stuff.  (They tend to be more paranoid about outdoor dangers than <br/>
those that spend a lot of time out there.)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, for what it's worth, I think a first aid kit is totally <br/>
unnecessary for most people, but hey, if you feel safer carrying it <br/>
around, go right ahead.  Someone else that injures themselves who <br/>
doesn't have a first aid kit will welcome the fact that you brought <br/>
it!  =)<br/>
<br/>
As for cell phones--I tend to think they give people a false sense of <br/>
security.  Most of the time, out in the mountains, they don't work to <br/>
begin with.  And even when they do, you still have to know where you <br/>
are to lead rescuers to your predicament.  And even if you know where <br/>
you are, if the injury is serious enough to bring in rescuers, you're <br/>
probably unconcious anyhow and can't use the phone for that reason.  <br/>
You wouldn't believe how many stories I've heard about people with <br/>
cell phones calling for help because they got lost.  (Usually the <br/>
same people walking around with GPS's they don't know how to use.)<br/>
<br/>
No, a better idea--if you're the paranoid type, at least--is to bring <br/>
a friend that can go for help if it becomes necessary.<br/>
<br/>
But then, I've been known to drink untreated water from streams and <br/>
ponds, dare bears by using my food bag as a pillow, looking for <br/>
rattlesnakes, and anything else that flies in the face of logic and <br/>
prudent outdoor skills.  So what do I know?  =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings Everyone <br/>
<br/>
I thought I would add a little to what Ryan said.  I use to always <br/>
carry my cell phone with me. I thought it would come in handy if <br/>
someone ever got really hurt.  Back in May I learned a pretty good <br/>
lesson though I broke my ankle in three places up at the top of a <br/>
hike in Pasadena California.  I guarantee you that if a cell phone <br/>
doesn't work in the hills of California it doesn't work in the hills <br/>
of most places. <snicker> <br/>
<br/>
As for the first aid kit  I tend to disagree with Ryan.  Iron`Bear <br/>
is a long time hiker and camper and he almost always carries a small <br/>
first aid kit when we are going on any sort of hike over a mile or <br/>
two.  Now the first aid kit he carries is VERY small, it is about 3x3 <br/>
inches and about 1 inch in depth, but that little sucker holds a <br/>
lot.  Personally I've only had to delve into it once and that was for <br/>
a wet wipe in a potty stop without toilet paper, but hey.  My other <br/>
thought on the whole thing is that anyone with kids should definitely <br/>
carry something similar.  An adult that won't die without a band aid <br/>
is one thing  but a kid is a totally different story.  I've seem Sim <br/>
Kitty have to have a band aid on a cat scratch in the house, I can <br/>
just imagine if she accidentally fell and scraped her knees up on the <br/>
trail.<br/>
<br/>
That's my three cents on the topic at hand.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While I agree with Ryan that bandaids aren't going to save your life, I do <br/>
carry bandaids in my letterboxing pack -- to keep the blood of a fresh cut <br/>
from dripping onto some letterbox log!<br/>
<br/>
In what I consider my "emergency" provisions, I also have some alcohol <br/>
wipes (like bandaids, they don't take up much space), a space blanket, <br/>
water purification tablets, a waterproof windbreaker or poncho, matches in <br/>
a waterproof container and a small flashlight. I always have a bottle of <br/>
water and some snack item, too.<br/>
<br/>
I frequently hike alone, so my choices are based on surviving a worst-case <br/>
scenario: I slide or fall down a cliff in some remote area and am unable or <br/>
find it very difficult to walk. In that case, exposure, hypothermia and <br/>
dehydration are the biggest concerns, since it could be several days until <br/>
help arrives. I do usually have my cell phone, too, but I don't count on <br/>
being able to get a signal out in the wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, those snake bite kits with the suction cups? Fuggedabut them -- they <br/>
won't do you any good. In case you're bitten by any kind of poisonous <br/>
snake, get to help ASAP -- anti-venom is the only thing that's going to <br/>
save you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes dear, but some of us hike with "smalls" -- and while i might well be able to fix an injury and call for help, i might not be able to carry her out of some of the places i've been.<br/>
<br/>
as for the phone -- i check it when i'm going in -- if i'm going into an area where the reception isn't there, i simply become concious of that.<br/>
<br/>
as for the med kit -- ok, confession time -- i'm a medic (or was a million years ago), so yes, i *could* set a broken leg and carry her out of *some* of the places i've been -- but not all -- hence the phone...<br/>
<br/>
but even if one *isn't* a medic, bandaging (and i'm not talking a bandaid here, i'm talking serious bandaging for a wound of some sort or strapping an ankle so you *can* hike out) someone so they can make it out with help is still useful.<br/>
<br/>
So what's in my med kid?  ace wraps -- usually 3 or 4 -- and large squares of muslin (packaged as "slings" at most stores) -- again, usually 4 or more.  Some gauze pads, some tape (either athletic or micropore -- depending on how rich i was feeling when i last purchased...).  Bee sting ampules (yea, yea, yea -- but *you* go hiking with small children and let one of 'em get stung and see how much it was worth it to *you* (and the rest of the hiking group) for you to have been carrying them -- it's amazing what "calming down" the kid can do for enjoying the rest of the hike -- for both the child *and* the rest of the group).  Antiseptic of various forms.  And various other bits and pieces (including some "surgical" scissors (read: scissors with nubby ends so i don't cut the patient...) to cut bandages and such.<br/>
<br/>
Do i carry this kit *every* time?  nope -- the whole kit gets pulled out for hikes into places I don't know where I can't expect lots of traffic -- for a wander in Discovery Park in Seattle, i bring water bottles.  For Rattlesnake Ridge, water bottles, unless i've got kids -- then i might bring the kit (easier to grab than take apart of the bits i really want -- that's a heavily trafficked trail).  For the back side of Couger Mountain which i  *don't* know, probably the whole kit.<br/>
<br/>
If i was hiking solo or with other adults -- i probably *should* bring the aces and slings -- i couldn't carry most adults out anymore (we *all* weigh too much these days :&gt;) -- but i tend to bring just water and the phone -- lazy me -- hope it doesn't bite me in the back side one day...<br/>
<br/>
but that's me :)<br/>

I don't carry a first aid kit for day hikes.  I figure things like <br/>
bandaids can wait until after I get back to my car.  At least I've <br/>
never heard of anyone dieing from not getting a bandaid on quick <br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
While backpacking on the AT I did carry a small kit of bandaids, <br/>
antisepectic stuff, moleskin, aspirin, and minor stuff like that <br/>
since it could be several days before I'd get into a town.  Also some <br/>
really small tweezers to get those blood sucking ticks off.  (Used <br/>
that a LOT in Virginia!)  I figured if the injury was more serious <br/>
than that, I'd have a bunch of rescuers carrying me out anyhow and <br/>
would probably bring lots of emergency medical supplies as well.  =)  <br/>
And if I was in even worse shape and died, well--then medical <br/>
supplies wouldn't matter much anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
I also had another theory while on the trail: A day never passed <br/>
where I didn't pass people that carried honking huge first aid kits <br/>
and if you needed a bandaid or something, there were always PLENTY of <br/>
people around that LOVED to be helpful.  Weekenders and day hikers <br/>
were famous on the trail for carrying all sorts of extra unnecessary <br/>
stuff.  (They tend to be more paranoid about outdoor dangers than <br/>
those that spend a lot of time out there.)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, for what it's worth, I think a first aid kit is totally <br/>
unnecessary for most people, but hey, if you feel safer carrying it <br/>
around, go right ahead.  Someone else that injures themselves who <br/>
doesn't have a first aid kit will welcome the fact that you brought <br/>
it!  =)<br/>
<br/>
As for cell phones--I tend to think they give people a false sense of <br/>
security.  Most of the time, out in the mountains, they don't work to <br/>
begin with.  And even when they do, you still have to know where you <br/>
are to lead rescuers to your predicament.  And even if you know where <br/>
you are, if the injury is serious enough to bring in rescuers, you're <br/>
probably unconcious anyhow and can't use the phone for that reason.  <br/>
You wouldn't believe how many stories I've heard about people with <br/>
cell phones calling for help because they got lost.  (Usually the <br/>
same people walking around with GPS's they don't know how to use.)<br/>
<br/>
No, a better idea--if you're the paranoid type, at least--is to bring <br/>
a friend that can go for help if it becomes necessary.<br/>
<br/>
But then, I've been known to drink untreated water from streams and <br/>
ponds, dare bears by using my food bag as a pillow, looking for <br/>
rattlesnakes, and anything else that flies in the face of logic and <br/>
prudent outdoor skills.  So what do I know?  =)<br/>

<br/>
Yes dear, but some of us hike with "smalls" -- and while i might well be able to fix an injury and call for help, i might not be able to carry her out of some of the places i've been.<br/>
<br/>
as for the phone -- i check it when i'm going in -- if i'm going into an area where the reception isn't there, i simply become concious of that.<br/>
<br/>
as for the med kit -- ok, confession time -- i'm a medic (or was a million years ago), so yes, i *could* set a broken leg and carry her out of *some* of the places i've been -- but not all -- hence the phone...<br/>
<br/>
but even if one *isn't* a medic, bandaging (and i'm not talking a bandaid here, i'm talking serious bandaging for a wound of some sort or strapping an ankle so you *can* hike out) someone so they can make it out with help is still useful.<br/>
<br/>
So what's in my med kid?  ace wraps -- usually 3 or 4 -- and large squares of muslin (packaged as "slings" at most stores) -- again, usually 4 or more.  Some gauze pads, some tape (either athletic or micropore -- depending on how rich i was feeling when i last purchased...).  Bee sting ampules (yea, yea, yea -- but *you* go hiking with small children and let one of 'em get stung and see how much it was worth it to *you* (and the rest of the hiking group) for you to have been carrying them -- it's amazing what "calming down" the kid can do for enjoying the rest of the hike -- for both the child *and* the rest of the group).  Antiseptic of various forms.  And various other bits and pieces (including some "surgical" scissors (read: scissors with nubby ends so i don't cut the patient...) to cut bandages and such.<br/>
<br/>
Do i carry this kit *every* time?  nope -- the whole kit gets pulled out for hikes into places I don't know where I can't expect lots of traffic -- for a wander in Discovery Park in Seattle, i bring water bottles.  For Rattlesnake Ridge, water bottles, unless i've got kids -- then i might bring the kit (easier to grab than take apart of the bits i really want -- that's a heavily trafficked trail).  For the back side of Couger Mountain which i  *don't* know, probably the whole kit.<br/>
<br/>
If i was hiking solo or with other adults -- i probably *should* bring the aces and slings -- i couldn't carry most adults out anymore (we *all* weigh too much these days :&gt;) -- but i tend to bring just water and the phone -- lazy me -- hope it doesn't bite me in the back side one day...<br/>

<br/>
Well I thought I would be a little more detailed about how Team Chaos <br/>
hits the trails<br/>
<br/>
We almost always take walking sticks  as a matter of fact Iron`Bear <br/>
bought me a new one especially for my birthday and got two for the <br/>
price on one and they adjust so Sim Kitty can use one too, though we <br/>
always gave her a small cut broom stick to use before.<br/>
<br/>
We usually have two packs, one I carry with all the letterboxing gear <br/>
in it and one Iron`Bear carries with his fast array of "what you <br/>
might needs".  I think that usually includes some knife of some sort, <br/>
a small first aid kit, and a flashlight.  We take along plenty of <br/>
water and if we are hiking any substantial distance or plan to be <br/>
doing several short hikes in a day, we take along snacks.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally agree with taking along precautions, just because I have <br/>
gotten seriously hurt out there on the trail.  I think the idea of an <br/>
ace bandage or two in the pack is a grand idea.  It would have helped <br/>
me tremendously hiking down on that broken ankle. Of course a <br/>
flashlight since it was dark would have helped then too.  The cell <br/>
phone didn't do me any good  but I can see taking it along.  I have <br/>
done it too, sometimes just to call someone and tell him or her how <br/>
cool something I just found was.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally for me, I never hike alone.  I am always with Iron`Bear <br/>
when I hike now and that offers a very large sense of security for <br/>
me.  For those of you that have seen him you probably understand, for <br/>
those that haven't well I guarantee that Man could get Sim Kitty or <br/>
eye out of anywhere he needed too.  He could probably pick us both up <br/>
on a normal basis, let alone when adrenalin kicks in and someone you <br/>
love needs you.  In the future I am considering some letterboxing <br/>
with girlfriends I have made and I think at that time I would carry a <br/>
bit more myself, and Iron`Bear would probably insist I do so.  I do <br/>
know that our rule of thumb and I know Chuck and Trish who we met at <br/>
the gathering have the same one  is that Trish and I never go out <br/>
hiking alone. I might grab a park box, or a drive by, but never <br/>
anything that requires hitting the trails. <br/>
<br/>
In the past we have not carried a letterbox first aid kit  we are <br/>
fixing that now as a result of our experience yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
We usually also carry things like sun block, sunglasses, and always <br/>
try to wear appropriate clothing, and I tend to take a camera along <br/>
when I don't think it will be in the way if we have Sim Kitty with <br/>
us. <br/>
<br/>
That's Team Chaos on the trail in a nutshell  though pandora is <br/>
still searching for the pack that she really wants to carry it all <br/>
in  I'm quite picky about fashion and things though <grin>  I <br/>
believe it is something on my Christmas list =) Oooo I hope Iron`Bear <br/>
is reading this.<br/>

handy at times, but mostly optional.<br/>
<br/>
As for snake bite kits--most snake bites won't kill a healty adult.  <br/>
You might wish you were dead, but it's not the same as being dead.  <br/>
And since I've heard that snake bite kits are generally ineffective, <br/>
I wouldn't bother carrying it around.  If you're bitten, get off the <br/>
trail the quickest way possible and call for help.  For kids, older <br/>
people, or those in poor health to begin with, it's absolutely <br/>
critical they get help ASAP, and a snake bite kit ain't gonna cut it.<br/>

just because he is being down right ornery this morning, and chuckles <br/>
to himself]<br/>
<br/>
Good day Carie and others. <br/>
<br/>
I thought I would give some of my personal suggestions, and explain <br/>
what I bring along, in accordance to this topic. I feel that carrying <br/>
something such as a first aid kit is something that should be done. <br/>
You should have one especially if you have children or are an <br/>
inexperienced hiker/letterboxer your self. What I am not saying here <br/>
is that you should carry a Case-o-Band-Aids, a case-o-Neosporin, a <br/>
case-o-Gauze and so on. We don't need to be a walking pharmacy nor <br/>
are we a Medic in a war when we are out letterboxing. So what I <br/>
carry, as pandora has mentioned, is a very small waterproof rubber <br/>
container with just a few things in it. Some Band-Aids, clean wipes, <br/>
iodine, antibacterial cream. And then I have my personal kit that I <br/>
always carry when I am by my self hiking or fishing what have you. <br/>
This includes the main item for anyone going out; a good knife, <br/>
perhaps a locking bladed knife would be your best choice, a 3-inch <br/>
wide Ace-Bandage wrap, 3-inch wide roll of gauze, some biodegradable <br/>
hiking toilet paper, Aleve, and some breakable Iodine packs. <br/>
<br/>
Also a flashlight is highly recommended, I personally have a small <br/>
Mag-lite that is in my pack, and then I also I carry a compass. Most <br/>
letterboxers have a compasses, however if you are unfamiliar with <br/>
where you are at, perhaps it would be a good idea to just pull the <br/>
compass out before you trek off and take a quick reading while you <br/>
are at the car. That way in the worse of worst scenarios you at least <br/>
have an idea of what direction you need to maintain to get back to <br/>
your starting point. I am sure that this also goes without saying but <br/>
we also do want to keep in mind that if we ever use any of the first <br/>
aid products that the refuse material that is left over goes with us <br/>
out the trail and thrown away at the end of the hike. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly with this conversion to daylight savings time it can become <br/>
very confusing to some when the sun will actually look upon us for <br/>
the last time until the morning, and it can be very dangerous to be <br/>
out at night on the trail. I have a fairly good and painless way of <br/>
knowing when sunset will happen. Simply log onto this link: <br/>
http://weather.yahoo.com/imgindex/index.html . It takes you right to <br/>
the yahoo weather section. All you need to do then is type in the <br/>
city or zip code that you are going to be out and about in and hit <br/>
enter. Simply scroll down towards the middle of the page and it will <br/>
tell you when sunset is. However, it should probably be kept in mind <br/>
that we would want to subtract about a half hour or more from that on <br/>
when we want to be back at the car, just for personal preference and <br/>
safety for you and your fellow letterboxers. <br/>
<br/>
