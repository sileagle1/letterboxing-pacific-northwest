Sleepy Whippet & I are coming up from the Portland/Vancouver area and would like to score a few boxes on the way up to the party.  Can anyone offer suggestions for some boxes to look for that are right off of I-5 and can be found in 10-15 minutes?  We plan to leave early to grab a few before the Fest starts, but don't want to spend a lot of time on each one.<br>

Thanks!<br>

Letterbox Placed by: dvn2r ckr & trkr.  It is in Centralia.<br>
<br>
...uh don't forget to start / stop by the restrooms before you look <br>
for Buggy, at least do some exercises by the restrooms before you <br>
start...<br>
<br>
Have a great time!!<br>

We recently joined the club here at yahoo.  We were introduced to <br>
letterboxing from a fellow co-worker of mine and have since fell in love with <br>
this hobby.  We have seen a few postings on "Fright Fest".  We would love to <br>
have more information regarding this event.  We are also interested it <br>
information from others on what they use to make their hand made stamps.  <br>
We have found 3 so far and look forward to finding more.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any information.<br>
