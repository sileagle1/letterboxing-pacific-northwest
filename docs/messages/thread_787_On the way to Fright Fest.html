Sleepy Whippet &amp; I are coming up from the Portland/Vancouver area and would like to score a few boxes on the way up to the party.  Can anyone offer suggestions for some boxes to look for that are right off of I-5 and can be found in 10-15 minutes?  We plan to leave early to grab a few before the Fest starts, but don't want to spend a lot of time on each one.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

for Buggy, at least do some exercises by the restrooms before you <br/>
start...<br/>
