                    <div class="plaintext-content">I managed to get out on Saturday and look for a few boxes.  I <br/>
realized that I hadn't found a box since March.  MARCH!!!  Can you <br/>
believe it??  Anyway, here's an update:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many Happy Returns of the Day  Alive and well.  Hard to find <br/>
though ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sophia - alive and well (awesome stamp by the way)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Adele  didn't find this one.  No clue what a lemon tree looks like, <br/>
so I didn't find it.  Lots of people around, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rivervilla Park  not there.  I'm sure I was in the right place, but <br/>
no box. (Oh, look.  It says it's missing on LBNA.  That will teach <br/>
me to print out clues and not confirm them before leaving the house)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mom Mexico &amp; Me  I found part of this series a while back. While I <br/>
was at the park I checked up on it.  Here's what I found:<br/>
<br/>
            Box 1  did not find this one.  Found it before, so I <br/>
know I was in the right place.<br/>
<br/>
Box 2  did not find this one.  Found it before, but I think the <br/>
stairs have been redone since I was there last.  Possibly it is <br/>
hidden farther off to the side, but some people came along before I <br/>
could get in there and dig around.<br/>
<br/>
            Box 3  Alive and well.  A little damp inside though.<br/>
<br/>
            Box 4  Alive and well.  Very damp inside.  The log book <br/>
is starting to look a bit moldy.<br/>
<br/>
            Box 5  Not there as noted in the clues<br/>
<br/>
            Box 6  Alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
            Box 7  did not find this one, but I didn't have my <br/>
compass with me, so I could have been in the wrong place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Love Shack Wedding Memorial  found the shack but not the tree.  I <br/>
ran out of time to search some more, though.<br/>
