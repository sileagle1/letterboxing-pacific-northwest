Let's see, close to home I would never have gone up Horsetail Falls if it<br/>
wasn't for Der Mad Stampers boxes.  A little farther from home would be<br/>
Forest Park, Crystal Springs, and of course the fabulous boxes at Cape<br/>
Disappointment!  (One in particular took me to a lovely little hide away,<br/>
but I'll never tell which one!)<br/>

places I had never, or rarely, visited before. I couldn't begin to<br/>
list them. However, a very special trip was one I took to the midwest<br/>
in 2002. <br/>
<br/>
For ages and ages, I had wanted to go there to see the sandhill cranes<br/>
during spring migration. I finally made the time to do it but instead<br/>
of doing the 'normal' thing and flying into Omaha or Lincoln, I flew<br/>
into Kansas City. A girlfriend from St. Louis met me there. In the<br/>
motel room that night, she carved a sig stamp and in the morning we<br/>
set out on our adventure.<br/>
<br/>
We traveled across North Central Kansas with Der Mad Stamper as our<br/>
guide. This is home to many of his earliest letterboxes. He took us to<br/>
the geodetic center of the US, the log cabin where Home On the Range<br/>
was written, a fossil sea bed, a prairie dog colony. We traveled<br/>
hundred of miles of two lane blacktop and saw lovely rural Kansas, a<br/>
place I might never have visited if it hadn't been for letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
The cranes, incidentally, were everything I had hoped they would be.<br/>
Plus, the letterboxes I left on that trip are still alive and well.<br/>
One has even been adopted by a local Audubon Center. Some letterboxer<br/>
dropped a clue sheet on their grounds and staff found it. Amazingly<br/>
enough, they took it under their wing, even removing it when they did<br/>
a controlled burn this fall! Funhog<br/>
