Gee, I wish I could take time off work and meet you - especially since<br/>
one of my boxes is in your plans.  I was just at the cemetery on<br/>
father's day saying "hello" to my dad and checking that box.  I'm<br/>
honored that you want to see it.  I'll keep watch on the plans being<br/>
made and jump in if I think I can make it.  Enjoy your time here! <br/>
Looks like the weather will be beautiful for you.<br/>
