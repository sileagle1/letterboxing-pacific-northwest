Here is the address for the boxes that are in your area.  You may <br/>
wish to look in the "whats new" section too. There  will be boxes <br/>
that folks have added in the last few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if yu have any boxing buddies in your area,  You  may <br/>
be a pioneer.<br/>
<br/>
Use whatever stamp you want .  One will do,you can carve yourself or <br/>
pick a stamp from the store that best represents you.  I carved my <br/>
first stamp using a kit from Michaels that came with "the pink <br/>
stuff"  I currently use PZ Kut which you can find on line.  It really <br/>
holds the carving tool firmly, but is not hard to cut.  You might <br/>
like a slightly softer product to start.<br/>
<br/>
When you see others stamps you might get an idea for carving one <br/>
yourself or perhaps planting boxes in the CB area for others.<br/>
