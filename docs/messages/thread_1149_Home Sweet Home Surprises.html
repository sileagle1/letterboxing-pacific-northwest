<br/>
Recently, we made a last minute trip to Iowa, and asked Wingnut and <br/>
Kittypiller to take care of our pets.  While we were away, they <br/>
placed a box IN OUR HOUSE!  It took some time (and help) to locate <br/>
the box, since we had to move part of the structure to get at it.  We <br/>
found it above the ceiling over the deck.<br/>

The moral of this post is:<br/>
Be careful when fellow letterboxers have unfettered access to your <br/>
domicile.  Who knows what you will find <br/>
