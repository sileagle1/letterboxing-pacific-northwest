We are really sorry you couldn't make it - we were a bit concerned about you<br/>
and yours on Friday night when you didn't show up and were relieved a bit to<br/>
find out that it was just a case of someone being sick and not something too<br/>
terribly serious when Charlie informed us on Saturday.  I am terribly sorry<br/>
to hear about your husband's adventures in ER this weekend and hope all<br/>
turns out well when he sees the cardiologist tomorrow. -- I think you are<br/>
right though, sometimes things happen for a reason and it ended up being a<br/>
good thing that you stayed home and was able to be there for him. I felt the<br/>
same way when our car broke the night before going to California -- it<br/>
delayed us, made us miss a lot of boxes we would have gotten on the way<br/>
down, but saved us from being stranded when the car would have broke down on<br/>
the way there 100s of miles from home.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep us informed and we will look forward to seeing you at the next<br/>
event!<br/>
<br/>
Pandora<br/>

<br/>
You are very welcome for the help - and we were all disappopinted in not<br/>
having a chance to meet you. However- from the sounds of it you were much<br/>
better off staying home. I hope that you whole family recovers nicely - and<br/>
very soon. We completely understand your situation of not being able to make<br/>
it. No one else took you site - but then again I don't think anyone needed<br/>
it - there was plenty of room to go around.<br/>
<br/>
On a lighter note - we look forward to a time in the future that we will get<br/>
a chance to meet you at a gathering or otherwise. We only have the rest of<br/>
our lives to do it - so in the mean time may all of your letterboxes that<br/>
you go searching for be right where you think they are. -smiles-<br/>
<br/>
I bid you well. <br/>
<br/>
