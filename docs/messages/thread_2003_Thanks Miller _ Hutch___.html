sushi today!  We went over to Whitaker Ponds (a place I'm very famililar<br>
with since it is the home to an organization I have volunteered for<br>
religiously for the past 4-1/2 years).  We got one of Maiden's boxes,<br>
called Garden of Love, I think.  We didn't find any of the others.  <br>
<br>
After that we headed elsewhere for a wonderful box by the elusive<br>
twosome, Miller & Hutch.  SUCCESS!!!  We have decided that this<br>
enigmatic pair is much better at carving than singing, but we appreciate<br>
the innovative clues!!!  Not only that, but we absolutely love their<br>
wonderful stamps.  <br>
<br>
I wish I could get more of their boxes, but how to access their clues is<br>
as much a mystery to me as the placers themselves are.  In any case,<br>
thank you, Miller & Hutch for a fun hunt and another work of art in my<br>
logbook!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
