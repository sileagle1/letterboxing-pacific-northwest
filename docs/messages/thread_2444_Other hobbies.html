                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm another voracious reader, as is Miss Kitty.  I also enjoy writing and public <br>
speaking, and I follow the world of competitive ice skating - I used to be a <br>
skater myself, and spent eleven years as a skating judge before I decided the <br>
politics and the travel was more than I wanted to do (about the time Miss Kitty <br>
was a year old).<br>
<br>
Snuggle Bunny is a gymnast, and since she just turned 6, is now ready to <br>
begin competing.  Miss Kitty loves to read, ride her bike, and act (in fact, she's <br>
currently appearing as Soldier #1 in Gresham Little Theater's production of <br>
Robinhood, which is running through next weekend and is very funny!).<br>
<br>
Tractor Boy likes to wrestle, "fight," ride his Big Wheel, and play with his <br>
Thomas the Tank Engine set.<br>
<br>
We're excited about the end of the downpour/icy wind/landslide season, so <br>
we can get back to some letterboxing - we especially enjoy the hikes.<br>
<br>
Oh, and we're a homeschooling family, too.  All the better to get out on any <br>
given sunny day to find a few good letterboxes!<br>
