                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of blackberries, my grandmother used to tell me a story of<br/>
her youth that is very interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
Her father was the manager of a logging company near Clear Lake, WA<br/>
(close to Mt Vernon in the foothills of the Cascades).  The tells me<br/>
the story of when she was about 6 years old, back in 1922, that her<br/>
family was going to a company picnic, riding on one of the Clear Lake<br/>
Logging Company's steam trains along with the other employees and<br/>
their families.  On board was the owner of the company with his family<br/>
as well.  <br/>
<br/>
As they rode along, they came to a clearing where some blackberry<br/>
bushes were growing along the railroad tracks.  Some local folks were<br/>
there picking the berries.  Upon seeing these locals picking the<br/>
berries the owner of the logging company ordered the train to be<br/>
stopped. He then jumped off the train and chased the folks away<br/>
telling them, "These are my blackberries! You can't pick them! Go away!" <br/>
<br/>
It seems absurd to me, and to my grandmother, that this man could<br/>
actually claim to own all of the blackberries and would not allow<br/>
common folks to pick them as they ripened.  There is no way that this<br/>
man could have harvested all the blackberries that grew along the<br/>
close to 100 miles of track that his company owned.  <br/>
<br/>
But still, it was in 1922 and the Himalayan invasion was not fully<br/>
involved yet.  At that time, so she tells me, Himalayans were the<br/>
minority among blackberry bushes.  And, being the larger of the<br/>
varieties, the Himalayans were more desired by pickers.  The berries<br/>
that the folks were picking, she says, were indeed the Himalayans.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting<br/>

&gt; They're tasty, but if I were you I wouldn't attempt transplanting our<br/>
&gt; blackberries home with you. ;) The most pernicious ones we've got (and<br/>
&gt; therefore, the most plentiful) are actually what're called Himalayan<br/>
&gt; blackberries- they're not native and they're *very* invasive...<br/>
which you<br/>
&gt; could no doubt see!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ah, well, at least they're good to eat. Unlike some other non-native,<br/>
&gt; invasive plants. (Scotch broom, ugh!)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok don't ask me why, it is really early for me to be getting creative<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I tried!!!!  I cannot draw like my brother, but I added an idea I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had..........something other than a round shape!!!  Please keep in<br/>
&gt; &gt; mind that I can make cakes look pretty but I cannot not draw!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Check out the photos in the patch idea section!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  ==================I like that you incorporated a mountain and<br/>
water, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; especially like the<br/>
&gt; &gt; raindrop shape!  (I've heard you're getting a lot of rain lately...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometime within the last week or so, someone mentioned the blackberry<br/>
&gt; &gt; vines<br/>
&gt; &gt; in one of the posts about images for a patch design.   I know they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; very<br/>
&gt; &gt; invasive and definitely viciously SCRATCHY, but I must admit that<br/>
Martini<br/>
&gt; &gt; Man and I were in 7th Heaven stuffing our faces with those sweet juicy<br/>
&gt; &gt; berries last August - YUM!  We couldn't believe how many there<br/>
were and<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone hadn't already beat us to them all.  Those things sell for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fortune<br/>
&gt; &gt; around here, but you had them all over the place just for the picking.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to ordering one of the PNW patches after a design is<br/>
&gt; &gt; selected.<br/>
