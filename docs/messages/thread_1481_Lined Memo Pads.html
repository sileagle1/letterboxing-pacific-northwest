love to find them, I have to admit) -- I *do* prefer the unlined.<br/>

Solved this by getting small notepads that are lined on one side and not<br/>
on the other.  Cheaper than the fancy art pads, but unlined if I turn<br/>
the book over and mark it clearly :&gt;.<br/>

Just call me Chaotic Good...<br/>
