Well Sandi and I have been our very own letterboxing team for almost <br>
2 years now, we just leaving our men at home who dont understand this <br>
profound sport and head out for the trails. Well last april we had a <br>
four-legged join our team named Luke (golden-mastiff mix) and thus we <br>
became a trio! Well after going to the pound weekly for the last 6 <br>
months, Sandi has finally brought home her very own four-legged, tail-<br>
waggin, sniffin happy pup! He is a rott-collie mix she named <br>
Sprocket. We are so excited about the new addition we are going to <br>
take him out on the trail tomorrow :o) Hopefully he will be as good <br>
of a trail dog as Luke is :o) and if he is not, well maybe Luke will <br>
teach him :o) Hope to see you all out there on the trails, or maybe <br>
not...  Have you ever wondered how many people you pass on trails, <br>
assumingly everyone is pretending to be JUST hikers, how many of <br>
those other "hikers" are letterboxers too? I maybe have walked right <br>
past Funhog, Don and Gwen, Ryan, Amanda, and so many others and had <br>
no idea who they were....  :o) kind of a fun thought  :o) <br>
