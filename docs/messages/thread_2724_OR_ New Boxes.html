                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just couldn't help myself. I just had to put those two letterboxes<br>
into my backpack as I sauntered down into the Deschutes Canyon last<br>
weekend. It was mighty blustery but just as awe inspiring as ever.<br>
Somehow both boxes jumped out of my pack somewhere along the trail.<br>
The clue is called Rock Garden and can be found on LbNA, along with<br>
the clues for the eleven others I've sprinkled about the ranch over<br>
the last five years. <br>
<br>
In the process of excavating the pile of papers on my desk, I also<br>
discovered my notes for another box that I hid last September. The<br>
clue isn't doing much good sitting in my room, so I finally posted it,<br>
too. This one's called Drop Me a Line. It may well be under a foot of<br>
snow right now but it'll be waiting patiently for the next lucky<br>
letterboxer who gets to go to Camp Sherman, one of the most beautiful<br>
places on earth. <br>
<br>
Finally, the latest shipment of PNW Patches arrived yesterday. If you<br>
need information on how to get one, go here: <br>
