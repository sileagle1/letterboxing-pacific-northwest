Subject: a newbie question -<br>
<br>
Ok I'm a newbie and I've seen the name Der Mad stamper, but with all <br>
the talk about him lately I've got to ask... who is he?  I'm assuming <br>
he isn't from around here if others are adopting his boxes.  Just <br>
curious<br>

The Lacamas Creek letterbox is in Vancouver, WA but many of his are <br>
in Oregon or scattered about the US.  I've found one of his in Idaho <br>
and even think he has some in Kansas or Nebraska.<br>
