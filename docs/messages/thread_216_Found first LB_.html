plain sight!   We parked ourselves on a bench, I handed over a much coveted teething cookie and<br>
unpacked my stamp.  Sigh, my inkpad had been hauled out of the bag by a pixie who shall go<br>
nameless!  Best laid plans of mice & mommies......<br>
But, we shall return for the lovely Vashon Ferry LB!  If I work my timing a bit better, we may be<br>
