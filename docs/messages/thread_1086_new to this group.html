I am new to this group. I have been part of the LBNA group for about <br>
3 months now. I am so happy that there is a group for just this area. <br>
I live in Aloha, Or. Which is just west of Portland. My husband and I <br>
have really enjoyed finding the 4 boxes we have so far. My son(20 <br>
months old) enjoys getting ink all over himself. Well everyone have <br>
fun and hopefully the rain won't stop to many people.<br>
