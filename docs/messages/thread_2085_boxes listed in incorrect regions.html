                    <div class="plaintext-content">The boxes only show up in the counties under which the planters placed <br>
them when they originally posted the clues.  There are several boxes in <br>
incorrect counties in WA--it's up to the planters themselves to correct <br>
this--if that's their intention.  Some folks intentionally hide their <br>
letterbox clues in different regions for various regions.  Other times <br>
it's generally an oversight or folks just don't know in which counties <br>
the box resides. Not sure what the case is with these and the other <br>
letterboxes that are listed in incorrect counties. Perhaps contact the <br>
planter directly to let them know about the problem? Hope this helps,<br>
