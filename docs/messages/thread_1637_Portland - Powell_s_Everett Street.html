literature. The evil creator ran you all over the store, but this box was<br>
one of the very first boxes I ever found! (Before it went missing again).<br>
BUT I happened to know the author.. so I could bypass a good portion of the<br>
clues.<br>

  Hey Hey, thanks a bunch!<br>
  Not sure I can make Washington Park....but then<br>
  again...maybe I'll give it a shot.  I've read through<br>
  a few...sounded like fun....if I can remember where<br>
  Washington Park is. TEE HEE<br>
<br>
  Hey, I've only lived here two years...I'm not a<br>
  walking roadmap. :0)<br>
<br>
  Thanks!<br>
  I read the Powells clues even though it's missing and<br>
  I think I would have had to be carried out of the<br>
  bookstore in a strait jacket.....INSANE....for a<br>
  newby. :0)<br>
