Do you have a way to hide a letterbox that prevents it from becoming<br/>
damp, moldy or damaged by animals?<br/>
<br/>
BTW if anyone would like to take over posting the topics from time to<br/>
time, please let me know. I was hoping that this forum would be shared<br/>
by everyone. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One of the ways we make sure a box in a potentially snowy or wet location  <br/>
has a chance of staying dry is to dig a little hole and line it with  stones or <br/>
a rock the proper size so when we place the box on top of it  (them), the top <br/>
of the box is even with the original ground level.  Then we place a rock or <br/>
other items native to the location on top of the box.  This way, it would <br/>
probably not ever be sitting in a pool of water or wetness. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, 'digging the hole' needs to be done with care so no harm  will be <br/>
done and little will be disturbed.<br/>
