                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just placed a letterbox in Vance Park (between Portland and Gresham).  <br>
I'm going to be taking some new letterboxers there next Saturday as part <br>
of a Dog Scouts information sesson (see below for more info, everyone is <br>
welcome!)<br>
<br>
I'd really appreciate it if one or two local boxers could try to find it <br>
sometime this week so that the new boxers can see some log entries.<br>
<br>
Clue at http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=130058<br>
<br>
Also, there is a special First Dog Finder gift in the box.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
