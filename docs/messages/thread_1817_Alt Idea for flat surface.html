I like the 'elephant' idea for compactness and had made the following <br/>
for my Baker's Dozen trip to Dartmoor - thought it would be rainy <br/>
everyday.<br/>
<br/>
At craft store get a wood 'cigar box' that they show for making a <br/>
purse -- forget the handle and other do dads.<br/>
I did paint it up (actually I printed all the LBNA site logos and <br/>
decoupage them on).  In side I added a divided lengthwise on the <br/>
bottom half.  A compartment holds 4x6 cards or log book, to the right <br/>
a compartment holds my stamp and prestamped labels for speed <br/>
stamping. The top half holds several color pens and two small ink <br/>
pads.  For the inside top half I made a divider with an <br/>
acetate/plastic sheet across the front to hold the 4x6 cards after <br/>
they were stamped -- but the gorrilla glue didn't hold and I was too <br/>
rushed to get packed to do it up right.  So scotch tape came into <br/>
play for a temp hold.<br/>
<br/>
I can stamp either on the outside of the box, or if it is rainy, I <br/>
use one of the color pens to support the lid (like the bar for the <br/>
car hood?) and stamp inside the box, keeping everything dry.  Of <br/>
course if it is a driving rain, adding some side vinyl panels to drop <br/>
down would be another feature.<br/>
<br/>
If I get a chance I'll post a pic --- after the Xmas letters are <br/>
printed!!<br/>
<br/>
Have a Happy Holiday, and may you all get your letterboxing wishes.<br/>

Oohh! I like your idea too :o) seems even better than mine :o) I came <br/>
up with mine because I wanted something small and compact, I carry a <br/>
regular size backpack which would easily fit a cigar case, but I <br/>
originally came up with the idea for a gift for my LB sidekick and <br/>
she carries a miniature backpack, so it fits great for her. I might <br/>
have to try your cigar box idea though :o)And I didnt meant the "Pre-<br/>
school version" as an insult to your intelligence at all, it was just <br/>
a funny thing to say at the time because I was talking about <br/>
elephants and big ears :o)  and thats something alot of kids (and me) <br/>
can relate too :o) hope you didnt take it personally :o) And speaking <br/>
of elephants, the Oregon zoo has a 4 part series of LBs and one <br/>
involves an elephants foot and is called "packys place" and I wont <br/>
say where it is so as to not spoil the fun, but that was the most <br/>
interesting way to hide an LB I've seen yet, I really enjoyed it :o)<br/>
Happy holidays Everyone!<br/>

The Oregon Zoo series is actually only 3 parts.. the 4th box is separate.<br/>

Oohh i am very sorry to hear it is gone :o( that was such a great <br/>
hiding place. I was a little stumpd by the clue and when we walked in <br/>
there I was thinking, "Where on earth could it be hidden in here?" <br/>
and checked the spot, hoping but surely not expecting, and there it <br/>
was! I was very suprised and excited :o) what a fun one! :o) I hope <br/>
it returns soon and isnt gone permanently. Happy holidays!<br/>
