improvement over the original!  We'll try to be there then.  We're <br/>
in the process of moving at the moment so things are a bit chaotic <br/>
right now.  Of course, we could always use a little break in the <br/>

&gt;&gt; made stamp and looked like those I've seen in the few letterboxes<br/>
&gt;I've<br/>
&gt;&gt; found (sizewise/carving medium/ink bits/plastic bag it was in/blah<br/>
&gt;blah<br/>
&gt;&gt; blah).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The stamp has the name Byrd Square on it... and another marking<br/>
&gt;(shhh).<br/>
&gt;&gt; There was no notation of it being left in this particular box by<br/>
&gt;anyone,<br/>
&gt;&gt; but...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Is there something in Westport that might go WITH the stamp, or<br/>
&gt;does anyone<br/>
&gt;&gt; know if it belongs somewhere else?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, it's a shot in the dark, but hey, I figured I'd<br/>
&gt;start here.<br/>

Was at the Business  Expo Wednesday.  A local travel agency has a flyer for<br/>
a 7 day Exotic Western Caribbean Cruise entitled "Geocaching with Roger". <br/>
The only other comment, other than itenerary and price is "free:<br/>
one-of-a-kind custom designed T-shirt for Geocaching in the Caribbean 2004'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait for the Letterboxing Cruise.  They can repair the damage done!<br/>
