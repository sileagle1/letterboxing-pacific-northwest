Darn.  I just checked the online reservation page, and it seems the<br>
individual sites are taken.  :(  Well, we will have to see if we can<br>
work something out.  According to mapquest, Silver Falls is about an<br>
hour and a half from Portland.  Does that sound about right?<br>
<br>
I also realized that that last post was my first post to this list,<br>
and I hadn't introduced myself.  Sorry to be so rude.  My name is<br>
Samantha, I live in Aloha, Oregon.  I'm very new to letterboxing.  I<br>
heard about it several years ago, and always meant to learn more about<br>
it and get involved.  Life got in the way, however, until recently a<br>
bout of insomnia had me surfing the internet, and out of sheer<br>
boredom, I vaguely remembered that this hobby was something I wanted<br>
to learn about.  I couldn't remember what it was called, but Google is<br>
a wonderful thing and I finally hit on it.  I carved my own stamp,<br>
hijacked my partner and daughter, and we went out for our first<br>
letterbox!  They're hooked now too.<br>
<br>
I've been a member of this and several other lists since around that<br>
time, but I've been a bit hesitant to post.  The big list got pretty<br>
crazy with some very angry (and some downright mean) posts within the<br>
first few days after I'd signed up, and I wasn't sure what to think. <br>
I'm still leery of posting even an introduction there, but this list<br>
seems nicer.  :-)  I'm also going to introduce myself on the<br>
newboxers' list, so please forgive me if you are members there and see<br>
a similar message.<br>
<br>
This is a great hobby, and it's nice to have a place to share thoughts<br>
on it.  I hope you don't mind this post by such a newbie.<br>
