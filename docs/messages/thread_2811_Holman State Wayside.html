If there's anyone reading this who has a letterbox at Holman State Wayside<br>
(west of Salem on highway 22), you might be interested to know that the<br>
Wayside will be closing for awhile due to illegal activity. Its ultimate<br>
fate is still uncertain. No traffic will be allowed in, restrooms will be<br>
closed. They're going to try and keep the bike path through it open, so<br>
perhaps walking in on foot would also be allowed, but I don't know for<br>
sure (ie, will leaving the path be allowed?).<br>
