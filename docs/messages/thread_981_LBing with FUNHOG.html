Just a note to let you know that I had the rare pleasure of going out Lbing with <br>
Funhog. We actually went to one of her boxes that I had not yet gotten, but we <br>
had a great time, great conversation and beautiful scenery. I was the second <br>
to stamp in a box that has been there for almost 2 years!<br>
Thanks again Funhog and hopefully we can do it again really soon.<br>
