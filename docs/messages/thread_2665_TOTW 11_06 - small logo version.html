talk on AQ on 'got slogans.' There are some really fun ideas!<br>
<br>
Kurious Jo has some good points about the logo having a <br>
feminine appeal and appearance. Also, like her I think that it is <br>
terrifically adorable and a fun image. With that consideration and the <br>
fact that many logos have a smaller version, or one that reads better <br>
in black and white, etc. (I've had a little graphic design experience) <br>
I have tinkered around with Funhog's image, simplifying it, my thinking <br>
is that the logo could be small, and sbove the "breast pocket" area.  <br>
Then the slogan would be the big image on the shirt or bumper sticker. <br>
I uploaded a file as a visual of what I mean: sm lb <br>
