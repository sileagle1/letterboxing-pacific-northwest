three "scouts" that will be knocking on your letterbox door soon to <br/>
sell you some Camp Fire candy, Girl Scout cookies or Boy Scout <br/>
Christmas wreaths. "Girl Scout" &amp; "Boy Scout" Hitch Hikers will be <br/>
joining her soon in the Portland area. She was placed near a museum <br/>
that all of these youth groups have met together at one time or <br/>
another and is a tribute to that museum. Lets see if you can join <br/>
them all together on one page of your notebook.<br/>
Ding Dong. Would you like to buy some Camp Fire candy?<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
