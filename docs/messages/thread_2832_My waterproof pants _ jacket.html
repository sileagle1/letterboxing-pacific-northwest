                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I give up... I've apparently lost my waterproof hiking pants and <br/>
shell jacket.  The jacket was a darker blue and the pants were black --<br/>
 they are the "packable" kind, they each scrunch down into a small <br/>
packsacks for easy carrying in a backpack.  I use them often in the <br/>
winter &amp; spring.  Any chance that someone came across them at the <br/>
recent gatherings sometime this spring/maybe early summer, such as the <br/>
Rainbow Falls gathering?  Someone please tell me I left them in the <br/>
trunk of their car.<br/>
