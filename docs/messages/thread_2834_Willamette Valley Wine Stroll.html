Oregon has made a name for itself with its wines. Join your hostesses as we<br/>
"stroll" through the beautiful Willamette Valley touring vineyards, tasting<br/>
wine, and hunting letterboxes. In teams, you will visit pre-designated<br/>
wineries armed with a map and clues to gather stamps and information, all<br/>
worth points. The task becomes more difficult as you sample the wines,<br/>
trusting your designated driver to deliver you safe and sound. Which team<br/>
will arrive at the after party with the most points? <br/>
<br/>
Your hostesses have started the process of choosing wineries and have found<br/>
some BEAUTIFUL locations full of charm and character. It is going to be a<br/>
fantastic event. We also found that the majority of the locations have a<br/>
nominal tasting fee. These ranged from $3.00 to $10.00 (for 4 pours). Most<br/>
of these could be applied towards the purchase of a bottle if you choose to<br/>
go that route. With that in mind, we have decided that the rules will not<br/>
require EVERYONE (minus the DD of course) to taste at every winery. It is<br/>
perfectly acceptable for only one member of each team to taste at a winery<br/>
if you so choose. We did want to remind everyone that these wonderful<br/>
vintners are opening their locations to us, and that we can thank them by<br/>
being customers if we find something we like, and being gracious no matter<br/>
what :) <br/>
<br/>
Start forming your teams now! Each team is made up of four to six people;<br/>
one designated driver and three to five designated tasters. Once you have<br/>
your team, choose a team name and let the organizers know who you are. Jump<br/>
in with both feet, carve a team stamp, decorate your team vehicle, etc. You<br/>
just never know what points might be awarded for.<br/>
<br/>
****Send Marmalade a copy of your individual signature stamp by email or<br/>
snail mail by September 15th. (No you don't need to know what for) ******<br/>
<br/>
Don't have a team but want to be in on the fun? If you see someone signed up<br/>
that is not listed as a member of a team already, go ahead and contact them!<br/>
If you still need a team, or even part of a team, the event organizers will<br/>
match up smaller groups on September 30. This will allow your new team two<br/>
weeks to bond and plan. <br/>
<br/>
Sign ups close September 15th. If your plans change after that and you would<br/>
like to participate, contact the hostesses and we will see if there is still<br/>
space available. <br/>
<br/>
Please remember that this event is adults only and alcohol will be consumed.<br/>

Gwen and I just recieved a great record of all of the stamps used for <br/>
this shindig. Not only were there tons of stamps from across the <br/>
country, but the quality of all of those stamps were pretty neat. <br/>
Maiden and Marmalade are due much thanks for sending out this book. It <br/>
is as professionally done as I would imagine the event was. Thanks for <br/>
including us.<br/>
