Buenos dias, La Senora de Fuegos! <br>
<br>
Okay, that roughly translates to "Hello, Fire Lady", but that's close<br>
enough, right? =)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, if you use the Trip Planner at<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/trip/ you'll be able to search for<br>
all boxes listed on Atlas Quest that match your request. Change the<br>
maximum search distance to 5 miles, set the start of the search to<br>
Portland, and the end of the search to Bellingham, check the box to<br>
only return "drive-bys", and search. It'll list 23 different sets of<br>
boxes that might be what you're looking for. =)<br>
<br>
If you don't check the "drive-by" option, it'll return over a hundred<br>
possible boxes you might look for. Not all boxes that are drive-bys<br>
are actually listed as drive-bys, so many of those boxes will fit what<br>
you're looking for, but you will have to weed through them a bit to<br>
make sure it's actually a drive by.<br>
<br>
Happy trails! =)<br>

on my trip. It is so nice to be able to use a site like this and to <br>
have such a great response from such wonderful letterboxers. Also, I <br>
would like to add, a great way to plug your own site Mr. Turtle. (wink)<br>
Maybe if time permits, I might even leave a little treasure of my own.<br>
