I could have sworn there was an LB series based on Frost's poem "Whose Woods <br>
These Are," and the boxes were hidden seasonally in the Arboretum.   Since <br>
"Woods" has long been one of Wild Child's favorite poems, we were looking forward <br>
to nabbing them if we ever found ourselves in Seattle in winter.   We're <br>
heading north tomorrow, but alas--I can't seem to find the clues to these boxes.   <br>
Has the series been retired?<br>

Arboretum last year.  I , unfortunately did not keep a copy of <br>
thepoem, but it was very Frost - like.  You might see if it is <br>
archived from back then.  It was pulled after Christmas.<br>
