<br>
Over the weekend, I planted boxes 7-9 of my ongoing Superhero Series<br>
in the Beaverton area.  Clues are posted in the usual places, so head<br>
on out and let me know what you think.  <br>
<br>
A couple updates on this series:<br>
<br>
#2 (Bruce Wayne): It has been reported that the neighbors have been<br>
alerted to the existance of this box.  Therefore, I will be moving it<br>
to a different area of the park this week.  Clues will be updated when<br>
the box is in its new home.<br>
<br>
#4 (Hal Jordan): As previously reported, this box has gone missing and<br>
has been retired.  Clues have been removed but the box is still listed<br>
on LB and AQ as it shares an entry with box #3.<br>
<br>
#10 (???): This will be the final box in the series.  This stamp is<br>
carved and the box is ready.  Look for it to be placed within the next<br>
week.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all who have let me know that they have enjoyed this series.<br>
 I certainly have had a blast carving and hiding these stamps!<br>
