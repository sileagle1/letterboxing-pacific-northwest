                    <div class="plaintext-content">Happy to report that "In The Chimney" is still sticking it out at <br/>
Luther Burbank.  The Cranium HH set loose by the 7 Nails was supposed <br/>
to be there (left by DVN2R SKR) but it was not in the box and there <br/>
was no stamp showing who might have taken it.  They may have <br/>
forgotten to stamp into In the Chimney.  <br/>
<br/>
Replacing was a challenge as a family rolled in and parked with two <br/>
observant kids a short distance from the junction, in full view of <br/>
the placement location.  Luckily a mother duck with two peeping gawky <br/>
stage ducklings chugged by. I waited for them to distract the family <br/>
and scuttled in for the replacement.<br/>
<br/>
The fenceposts here are worth the trip for this and the other park <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I also found the Dolphin Mystery after a minor bit of trouble.  I <br/>
went right to the spot, but fought the absolute location of the box <br/>
until I read between the lines.  I could not believe that I was <br/>
required to go for it in that fashion but go I did.<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful location with tons of bird song, bug buzzing ( take bug <br/>
juice) and butterflies doing their thing.  September should present <br/>
plenty of opportunity to see Berry Drunk Robins in squabbling action.<br/>
<br/>
Happy sultry summer boxing, next weekend Bellingham!<br/>
