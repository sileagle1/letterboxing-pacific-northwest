                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings fellow letterboxers!!  Just wanted to check in with Funhog <br>
to let her know that Jess and I visited the four boxes you planted <br>
out there and found them in great shape, happy and healthy.  Went up <br>
on Saturday, April 10th with absolutely "gorge"ous weather.  The <br>
poison oak is sprouting up and Jess got a little concerned about her <br>
epidural well-being!!  We found the Trekkin' Llama just fine, though, <br>
away from the Poison Oak and with a most incredible view to enjoy!!<br>
<br>
Thanks for placing these for Jess.  We had a blast hunting for <br>
them!!  We really enjoyed the containers you entertained us with!!  <br>
How original!!<br>
<br>
You should come to Hood River soon and hunt out either the Fruit Loop <br>
series I just posted or the Mosier Twin Tunnels trilogy planted last <br>
week.  Jess is inching her way up to her "100 found" mark and I'm in <br>
for the ride!!  Thanks to her, I'm hooked!!<br>
<br>
Y'all get out there and enjoy this awesome weather while it lasts!!<br>
<br>
