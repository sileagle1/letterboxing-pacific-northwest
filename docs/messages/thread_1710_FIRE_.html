Hi all,<br/>
We went up to Fall Creek Res to plant a box for our Campin with JR <br/>
Series,(clues will be up shortly). Any ways there was a storm through the area <br/>
on Saturday night and when we got up there on Sunday morning we found a <br/>
tree that had fallen and was leaning on some power lines and the tree was on <br/>
fire! We called 911 and they sent the Fire Department up. It was pretty wild, <br/>
we have never prevented a forest fire before!  There were several fires in the <br/>
area and it prevented us from getting where we wanted to place our box, but <br/>
we found a good place and all is well. <br/>

Wow!  Any yahoo can start a forest fire, but only a lucky few can brag<br/>
about preventing one!  =)  (Not that I think there's a lot of people<br/>
bragging about starting forest fires--my point being that anyone can<br/>
start one, so it's nothing special to brag about.  Not that it's a<br/>
bragging event, of course!  Oh, I'll just shut up.  I'm just getting<br/>
my foot in my mouth even deeper....)<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had a great story like preventing a forest fire to brag<br/>
about, though.  I'm jealous!  =)<br/>
