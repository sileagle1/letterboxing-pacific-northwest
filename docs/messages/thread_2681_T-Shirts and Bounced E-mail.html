I haven't made a firm decision on the color of the logo and print. I<br>
was originally thinking of dark brown or black, but I'm afraid they<br>
won't show up well on dark shirts. So I've got it down to white, grey<br>
or goldenrod. What are your opinions? Keep in mind that the shirt<br>
colors are forest green, royal blue and maroon.<br>
<br>
I would love to credit Tolkien for the first half of the "wander"<br>
verse but I don't know how to do that gracefully. <br>
<br>
Part of the t-shirt team is consulting today to work out some details<br>
of the logo. Despite some differences of opinion, I'm confident that<br>
they will have a fantastic logo for us shortly. Then we'll take it to<br>
the printers!<br>

This is such a cool idea!   Please add these shirts to your order:<br>
(1) Forest Green, medium<br>
(1) Forest Green, small<br>
(1) Maroon, Medium<br>
(1) Maroon, XL<br>
<br>
The saying is a good one.  So . . .  I guess you guys decided that<br>
advertising letterboxing is ok?  I've had several people on the trail ask<br>
about the LbNA logo on my pack.  There's been a few times where I felt it<br>
was in the best interest of the hobby (like when we're in the vicinity of a<br>
letterbox) to tell them it stands for "Little Birds of North America".<br>
Ha-Ha!  afterwards, Wood-aug pulls my leg - asking "where's your<br>
binoculars?"  Guess answering it with "Little Birds of the Pacific NW" is<br>
out with the word "letterboxing" on the back, huh?  Have to get more<br>
creative . . . or maybe wear a shirt over it.<br>
<br>
Sounds like things are getting firmed up!  I'm anxious to see what they come<br>
out looking like.<br>
Thank you so much for the kind generosity of your time and effort for this<br>
cool project.<br>
<br>
Hope your Thanksgiving is filled with blessings!<br>
Kurious Jo<br>

Pilgrims & Angela, I just got your requests and you are on the list.<br>
Pilgrims, the sizes are average men's sizes, but we do have children's sizes<br>
S, M, and L, if that helps. Let me know what you decide.<br>
