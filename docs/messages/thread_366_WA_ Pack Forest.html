decided NOT to place boxes here.<br>
<br>
It is a lovely venue with over 4000 acres of potential.  However <br>
there is ongoing logging and timber work, hunting in season and road <br>
and trail closure as these activities require.<br>
<br>
It is far enough away from the mainstream of boxland in the region <br>
that I thought it unfair to send someone out to this venue only to be <br>
greeted by closed roads and /  or trails that would require much <br>
longer hikes, ( if at all) or totally closed access.  I know I would <br>
not appreciate spending the time and gas to go so far only to be <br>
turned back. <br>
<br>
I now have three boxes ready to go ( humble I know, don't snicker <br>
Bethany).  Perhaps this coming weekend there will be a likely spot.<br>
