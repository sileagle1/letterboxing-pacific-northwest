<br>
I've received updates on the following boxes:<br>
<br>
Timberline - as of 6/15 is officially destroyed.  The<br>
box was destroyed, the logbook in a baggie with a<br>
pencil inside left hanging on a tree, and the stamp is<br>
missing.  Two people had found this box - one was<br>
Maiden and the other was a LBer that found it "2<br>
HOURS" before the most recent boxer reported the<br>
damage.  The 6/15 LBer placed the box back where they<br>
thought it should be but there isn't a stamp to go<br>
with the remains.<br>
<br>
Beacon Rock - there is no evidence of a box being<br>
there any longer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LILY<br>
<br>
If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br>
