all.  Being fairly new at it, so many are a challenge that I can't decide.<br>

favorite hikes, favorite clues... However, there are a few that I<br>
consider "top drawer." In this category, I include Pungent Bob's<br>
wonderfully challenging $100 Bill. This one is amongst the finest<br>
around. This guy is evil, evil, evil and I thank him for it. Then<br>
there are the enigmatic duo, Miller and Hutch. Finding one of their<br>
clues is a real treasure. The wonderful Yellow Rose of Suffrage is a<br>
special gift hidden in a lovely spot, as well. I just can't pick a<br>
favorite but these are three of my local faves.  Funhog<br>

to do a bit of thinking to figure that one out. The one that was most <br>
challenging to find was funhog's Waterfowl Highway. It took five or six <br>
trips to find it, but that was just because I had tempory blindness when I <br>
was looking for it. ;)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our favorite box to this day is "Pooch Place" in Beaverton.  This was <br>
one of our first boxes and we had so much fun on our little walk.  Our <br>
son, who was about 5 at the time, reached in and found the box and he <br>
thought that was the coolest thing.  Cute stamp and a beautiful <br>
walk, but most of all, which is true with all the boxes we find, it<br>
is just good family time spent together!!!!  Thanks DMS!!<br>
