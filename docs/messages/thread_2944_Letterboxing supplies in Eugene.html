Hello.<br>
A tradegy happened during a move. My backpack with ALL my letterboxing <br>
stuff, log book, carving tools,etc. came up missing. I will be in <br>
Eugene tomorrow. Any hints on where I can find some speedball lino-<br>
cutters? And what about that pink stuff, I can't remember the brand <br>
name... I'm hoping someone can recommend a place to shop for it in <br>
Eugene. I live in Coos Bay and can't find anything around here. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Coyote - That is a sad loss.  I get my carving tools at Oregon Art Supply.<br>
<br>
http://www.oregonartsupply.com/<br>
<br>
I know for sure that they have the individual Speedball Cutters in the<br>
different sizes and the caligraphy type handles.  They may also have<br>
the rounded wood handles, some kits and or carving medium but I am not<br>
positive about those.<br>
<br>
Also try the U of O bookstore<br>
<br>
http://literary.uoduckstore.com/StoreAbout.aspx<br>
<br>
Michaels, located in Springfield near Gateway Mall, is the last<br>
resort.  The cutters that they carry are really large and not what you<br>
would want to carve a stamp with.  I think they carry Mastercarve but<br>
again I am not sure about the "Pink Stuff"<br>
<br>
We have a little scrapbooking shop here in Florence and I think she<br>
carries 1 or 2 beginner kits with basic carving set and pink stuff.<br>
<br>
Hope you can find what you are looking for and get back in the game soon.<br>

Maybe not the best quality, but have a look. I picked up a Speedball<br>
kit at Michael's craft store, next to Best Buy near Gateway. Ask<br>
around if you don't know where that is.<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>
