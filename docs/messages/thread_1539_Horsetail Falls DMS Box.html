As far as DMS boxes in general - ah, I've made my own<br/>
mind up that he left boxes behind for all types of<br/>
LBers.....those who enjoy hiking, those who enjoy<br/>
difficult puzzles, those who enjoy sightseeing, etc. <br/>
I wanted to attempt each DMS box in the area but I<br/>
can't - because all of his letterbox clues do not fit<br/>
with my  ability to "solve" so I have to forego those<br/>
because you will find that LBers aren't generally open<br/>
to "divulging" precious info about where boxes are<br/>
located.  Takes the fun out of the hunt....however, it<br/>
adds frustration to the person who searches for one<br/>
and it's NOT THERE and the placer won't confirm or<br/>
deny it.  YIKES! LOL <br/>

It's a pretty easy hike to get the box.  Not like Beacon Rock!  <br/>
That's for sure!  =)<br/>
<br/>
But the Multnomah Falls box is a tough one to find, even when you're <br/>
in the right spot.  It was my inspiration for the Beacon Rock hiding <br/>
place.  Easy to get to the right area, but wickedly difficult to <br/>
actually find.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you finally found it, though!<br/>

You will find Der Mad Stamper's clues for all of his boxes in the Gorge on<br/>
the LbNA <br/>
site under the Columbia River Gorge Waterfalls series. Also look at Ryan<br/>
Carpenter's <br/>
site for the clue to his replica of the Wahkeena Falls box. It has an<br/>
entirely different <br/>
hiding spot from the original...<br/>
<br/>
The DMS clues can be maddening but are always fun when the 'ah ha' moment<br/>
