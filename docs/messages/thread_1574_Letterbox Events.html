Which bridge DO you take to come to Washington?  Is it one we should <br/>
avoid?  Perhaps the Puget Island ferry is less dangerous???  Of <br/>
course, that would only work in the summer.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, it was great seeing you again at the gathering last <br/>
week.  Can't wait until the next one!<br/>
