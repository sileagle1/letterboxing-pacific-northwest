Milo McIver Rubber Stamp Camp Out<br>
Estacada, Oregon<br>
July 11 - 13, 2003<br>
<br>
This is a reminder that the Portland Oregon area gathering will soon<br>
take place at Milo McIver State Park in Estacada, Oregon.<br>
<br>
We'll be at Group Camp H2 and, per Funhog, the name it's under is<br>
"Rubber Stamp Camp Out". We've got the group camp for Friday, July<br>
11th from 4:00 pm that day to Sunday, July 13th at 1:00 pm, I<br>
believe. This is a tent area that can take 25 campers. For those<br>
not camping there is a Day Use Fee of, I believe $3.00. Campers can<br>
just tell them at the booth that they are part of the Rubber Stamp Camp<br>
Out at H2 and you shouldn't have to pay to get in at all.<br>
<br>
Events planned so far are Friday Night Potluck at 6:00 pm and into the<br>
evening.<br>
<br>
Saturday the Paisley Orca will have a carving demo at 1:00pm.  <br>
<br>
There may be pinatas.  One for kids and one for adults, but this is just<br>
a fantasy so far and not quite written in stone just yet.  My brother<br>
suggested it since his kids love whacking papier mache at birthday<br>
parties, apparently.  Also, anything else you can think of...We can have<br>
a goody swap, if you would like, as well.  Bring erasers, or<br>
letterboxing accessories to trade/giveaway.<br>
<br>
ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO DO SOMETHING OR HAS SUGGESTIONS, PLEASE LET ME<br>
KNOW.  <br>
<br>
MILO MCIVER STATE PARK GENERAL DRIVING DIRECTIONS FROM I-205 <br>
<br>
Take I-205.  <br>
<br>
Get off at the  OR-212 E/OR-224 E exit towards CLACKAMAS/ESTACADA.<br>
<br>
Turn RIGHT onto OR-224/OR-212 3.3 miles.<br>
<br>
Turn SLIGHT RIGHT onto OR-224 1.1 miles.<br>
<br>
Stay straight to go onto S SPRINGWATER RD. 9.5 miles.<br>
<br>
You're in the vicinity of the state park. Look for Milo McIver state<br>
park shield or name on a sign along the roadway.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much.  I'm looking forward to a great time with those of you<br>
who can make it.  Just feel free to show up!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>

Like around noon?  I'm just coming for the day and was hoping to meet up with <br>
everyone!  Maybe we can assume everyone will be around for the Carving Workshop?  <br>
Its gonna be fun!<br>

come "see how it's done."<br>
<br>
One thought I had when reading your message.  If you're trying to <br>
entertain the kids with the pinata.  You have a three day weekend, <br>
why don't you have the kids make their own pinata, then play the game <br>
on the last day before going home?<br>
<br>
You could even teach the kids how to carve their own stamps.<br>
<br>
And you could play all the typical yard games as a group.  <br>
Volleyball, Croquet, Ultimate, horse shoes, etc.<br>
<br>
I hope you all have a great time!<br>
