will be doing the same for Mt Tabor probably this coming weekend, just<br/>
to let folks who print and save clues know.  These were boxes I placed<br/>
for other people, and both series required too much maintenance for me<br/>
to just leave them in place.  So if you want Mt Tabor, get up there<br/>
before the weekend.  Hope to see everyone at McMenamin's on the 28th<br/>
so I can say goodbye, but I'm not going very far.  Sorry you can't<br/>
make it LadyB - I'm sure we'll be seeing one another in September at<br/>
the BIG EVENT.  Der Mad, Raqs, and Aunt Teri, I will be either giving<br/>
you the stamps and log books back on the 28th or leaving them with<br/>
someone local to give to you.  Lots of people enjoyed the stamps while<br/>
they were in place.<br/>
