Now that the letter has gone out, I'd like to say something else....<br/>
<br/>
I actually know Pandora in real life, she's the one that made mention of Letterboxing to Kris and that's what got us started.  I just wanted to show that it is so very easy for others to take what is said out of context others to react to them.  Those types of words are read in the frame<br/>
of mind that the recipient is in, not in the frame of mind the sender is in as we are missing two very vital aspects of  human communications, Tonal qualities and Body language.  With those missing, perception is reality. In other words, no matter how I meant what I typed, you'll read it in your frame of reference.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that ar to often, people are getting their (insert appropriate form of undergarment here) in a wad over things that really are not that important. I mean, come on, a war in Iraq still going on, troops perhaps heading to Liberia, The national Debt, the jobless rate, layoffs without warning, the crime rate climbing, near drought conditions in 3/4 of the world and water shortages only over the horizon, starving people all over the world, crude oil prices rising meaning higher pump prices, etc, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I do letterboxing because it's fun, I do it for relaxation, I do it because it allows me to complete with the one person I can compete with and not get angry if they win.... Myself. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My hope is that we'll all go back to what this once was, according to those that have been here the longest... A place where we can all have fun, and were we can exercise our right to delete that which we don't want to read. As simple as that.  I know I do and I receive this list in individual emails. Not a digest.  I'm a masochist guess.<br/>

I'm confused here, are you saying that Newbies, that is to say, those that are new to letterboxing and or this list are a pain in the butt?<br/>
<br/>
If so, than I guess I'm a pain in the butt twice over as a newbie to letterboxing and a newbie to this list.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies, pandora, for being a pain in the butt.<br/>

<br/>
  Hey can I be considered a newbie too please? Then I have a great excuse to<br/>
  ask for help and be a little pain in the butt all the time.  Just because I<br/>
  am new and all.  As a matter of fact can I be like a honorary newbie<br/>
  forever? That way I never have to be an oldie and never have to worry about<br/>
  stinky socks?  I really like this idea!<br/>

But seriously, yes, he is... I can personally attest to that...  Who else would continue to search for a letterbox well after the sun has gone down in a well-treed forest to the point of not even being able to read the words on the clue page he brought with us??? It was all I could do to keep from falling flat on my face from tripping over a silly tree root that decided it was going to hide in my path of walking, all because he just HAD to find one last box!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Masochist?  yes... PITA?  No doubt about it!  Wait..... don't these two go hand in hand?????<br/>
