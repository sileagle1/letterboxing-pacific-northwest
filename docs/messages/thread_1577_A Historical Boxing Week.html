                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay this has hands down been one of the most memorable letterboxing weeks I<br/>
have ever had.  - Monday and Tuesday Camp Fire Lady, Iron`Bear and I took on<br/>
a phenomenal Mystery Series.  This left a taste for Mystery in our mouths<br/>
and we set out on some other Mystery Box adventures.  Friday night we picked<br/>
up Sim Kitty and had dinner with Heather and Wild Woman, what a treat!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday we decided to hit the trails with Camp Fire Lady and Cats Meow, we<br/>
hit the Brat Packs new 2 x 2 series.  I have to say that the fact that it<br/>
was raining while we were doing this incredibly cute serious was quite<br/>
ironic,  Iron`Bear found a big stick to carry around with him while we were<br/>
hiking and looked a lot like Moses getting ready to part the red seas! -<br/>
After completing this series, and missing the bonus box (Iron`Bear should<br/>
really be whipped with a licorice string for this) we headed out to find<br/>
Team Nashoba's Mr. Potato Head series, and then to Ridgefield for a few more<br/>
Team Nashoba boxes. <br/>
<br/>
This morning we met with Camp Fire Lady, Cats Meow and Der Mad Stamp for a<br/>
day filled with what I consider historical boxing.<br/>
<br/>
First we hit DMS's Pooch Place Letterbox.  We knew this box was missing, but<br/>
DMS had a replacement, and we made sure to show him where we figured the<br/>
original box was to make sure we earned this one! <br/>
<br/>
Next we headed off to Rock Creek where we found one of Green Hornet's boxes.<br/>
(#2 in the series I believe)  We were headed for #3 when DMS told us that<br/>
the tree it was hidden in was gone and told us to wait there while he<br/>
scouted ahead for #4.  He came running back telling us #4 was missing, but<br/>
he thought we could find #3 again if we kept looking, the tree was just a<br/>
little farther up than he had remembered.  Iron`Bear quickly retrieved box<br/>
#3 and was helping DMS put it back when he decided to dig the hole DMS had<br/>
there just a little bit bigger to compensate for the next box.  Suddenly we<br/>
hear DMS and Iron`Bear cheering and laughing.  What is it? We asked them.<br/>
"Bear found the original" DMS exclaimed! DMS had replaced it when he scouted<br/>
ahead, but it ends up the original was still there! We were the only ones<br/>
signed into that box in 5 years!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We hit a few more boxes in the Beaverton/Tigard area as well. We are happy<br/>
to report that Hyland Forest is alive and well, as well as The Troll in the<br/>
Rock Creek Park Series.  Everything is Nonsense still seems to be eluding<br/>
everyone, though it is alive and well. DMS and Sim Kitty were able to find<br/>
it, what a team they are!  We ran into some Munchkins today and they just<br/>
all happened to be huddled around a munchkin size Christmas tree, who would<br/>
have thought! - Word of mouth is that that we found some seriously cool<br/>
boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
We are sad to report that Rock Creek #1 and #4 are officially missing, and<br/>
despite our efforts to yell and scream his name from the fence outside his<br/>
back yard, Green Hornet just would not come out and replace them! <br/>
<br/>
We are also sad to say it seems like Lily has gone on vacation and the Hamby<br/>
Park Letterbox seems as though it is no where to be found.  <br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful day, being with friends, boxing with one of the Pioneers of<br/>
Letterboxing in North America and just watching our daughter smile.<br/>
Everyone went home with new stamps in their journals and new memories that<br/>
they will cherish forever! I just love letterboxing.<br/>
