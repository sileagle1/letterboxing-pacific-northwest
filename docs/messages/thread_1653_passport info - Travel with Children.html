Customs and Border Patrol.  There info is below - they might not <br>
even ask to see it, but it is better to have it then to be stopped <br>
and questioned for hours. :)<br>

Adults traveling in or out of the U.S. with children under the age <br>
of 18 should be aware of the following: because of increasing <br>
incidents of child abductions in disputed custody cases and as <br>
possible victims of child pornography, Customs and Border Protection <br>
strongly recommends that unless the child is accompanied by both <br>
parents, the adult have a note from the child's other parent (or, in <br>
the case of a child traveling with grandparents, uncles or aunts, <br>
sisters or brothers, or friends, a note signed by both parents) <br>
stating "I acknowledge that my wife/husband/etc. is travelling out <br>
of the country with my son/daughter. He/She/They has my permission <br>
to do so." CBP also suggests that this note be notarized. While CBP <br>
may not ask to see this documentation, if we do ask, and you do not <br>
have it, you may be detained until the circumstances of the child <br>
traveling without both parents can be fully assessed. If there is no <br>
second parent with legal claims to the child (deceased, sole <br>
custody, etc.) any other relevant paperwork, such as a court <br>
decision, death certificate, etc., would be useful. Adults traveling <br>
with children should also be aware that, while the U.S. does not <br>
require this documentation, many other countries do, and failure to <br>
produce notarized permission letters and/or birth certificates could <br>
result in travelers being refused entry. (Canada has very strict <br>
requirements in this regard.) All children who are U.S. citizens <br>
should also have a certified copy of their birth certificate or <br>
baptism record for ID. Children over the age of 14 are also required <br>
to have a photo ID.<br>
