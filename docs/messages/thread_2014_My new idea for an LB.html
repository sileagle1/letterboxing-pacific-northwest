Thanks for all the responses guys :) I was a bit nervous about<br/>
posting <br/>
my idea because I didnt want anyone thinking I was begging for <br/>
donations or anything, so I am really glad to know you guys think its<br/>
a <br/>
good idea :) "Twilight" mentioned doing something liek this at the <br/>
animal refuge near her/him and I think that is a great idea too, dont <br/>
worry a bit about "copying" me, in fact I would encourage it if<br/>
anyone <br/>
decides to do so. Thanks alot everyone :) And just in case you are <br/>
curious of what rehabilitation center I was talking about, it is <br/>
Wildlife Images in Merlin, Oregon (southern oregon) and here is there <br/>
website adress in case you want to check it out. Thanks again <br/>
everyone! :)<br/>

P.S. I have decided to randomly add new stamps to this letterbox too, <br/>
all of them fashioned after one of the animals at the rehab center,<br/>
so <br/>
instead of just one stamp, there will periodically be more, and if <br/>
someone decides to leave an animal stamp they are more than welcome<br/>
too!<br/>
