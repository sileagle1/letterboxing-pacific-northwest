had our baby. We are aching to get back out there and find some more <br>
great letterboxes. We are excited to see so many new ones especially <br>
out here in Gresham where we live. Our little one is 6 months old now <br>
and ready to be introduced to letterboxing. Not to mention our other <br>
3 boys are ready to get back to it. We are going to work on new <br>
stamps this weekend and be ready to start heading out. We look <br>
forward to meeting the new people here and jumping back into it. See <br>
you around.         The Nikanders<br>

friends and family and know that they're still alive and well.<br>
