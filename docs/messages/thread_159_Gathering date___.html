<br>
We should setup a poll for the Portland Gathering and rather <br>
than vote for dates we CAN attend, vote for the dates we <br>
definately CANT ATTEND.  That way we can eliminate the worst <br>
dates and concentrate only on dates that the maximum number <br>
of people could make.  Once we have a small list of dates then <br>
we can have another poll to see which one is best of all.  This <br>
process could be done for all three proposed NW gatherings.  <br>

Heather & I couldn't find Funhog's Royal Angler in McIver after two hours of <br>
DELIBERATELY SEARCHING for it!  LOL!  I'd hate to be outdone by some <br>
musket-toting Civil War buffs! <br>
<br>
I thought those folks just stood in an open field and "fired" at each other & <br>
pretended to fall down dead.  ("No, it's your turn to fall down dead first; I <br>
fell down fell first last time!")  So do they also creep thru the forest in <br>
an attempt to surprise the enemy?  Or is it that their wives and <br>
children--who have probably already watched the North defeat the South for <br>
the umpteenth time--go wandering off in desperate search of absolutely <br>
anything else to do???<br>
<br>
(Not that I want to cast aspersions on someone else's hobby--not when I'm <br>
spending hours & hours looking for hidden plastic boxes and carving rubber s<br>
tamps! ;o)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, during the reenactment, the north doesn't always win the battle.  Since they aren't reenacting any particular battle (there weren't any, really, out west), they just go at it without any predetermined plan for which side 'wins' the battle.  At least that's that they claim before the battle begins.  Whatever happens just 'happens' and the outcome is not known in advance.<br>
