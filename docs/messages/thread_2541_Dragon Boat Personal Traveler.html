                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those of you in the Portland, Oregon area or for those of you who <br>
will be in Portland this weekend, June 10 & 11, there is a personal <br>
traveler waiting for you.<br>
<br>
I am on a dragon boat and the races are all day long, June 10 & 11.  <br>
All the teams have their spot under a huge tent ringing the lawn by <br>
the race finish line.<br>
<br>
You need to come to my team's booth and ask for me to get this <br>
personal traveler.  My team's name is Draggin' Butts.  (By the way, <br>
ask for Susan, as my team doesn't know me by KuKu.)<br>
<br>
I was going to make you do our rally cry ("Who's got the best <br>
Butts?" "DRAGGIN' BUTTS!"--response by whole team) but I figured my <br>
team would get tired of that.  So, just ask for me.  If no one is at <br>
our tent, it means we are lining up and about to race, so go cheer us <br>
on as we wing across the water.  I sit on the 3rd bench on the left <br>
in a yellow lifejacket.  Then, just hang around our booth until we <br>
come back!<br>
<br>
The lawn is right next to the roundabout with flags, the Riverplace <br>
hotel & its restaurant, Three Degrees.  For googling purposes, the <br>
address for the hotel/restaurant is 1510 SW Harbor Way.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you there!  I'm looking forward to greeting old and new <br>
friends.<br>

<br>
I will be cheering on Aquatect MG2 and I will look for you!  My booth <br>
is #26, Draggin' Butts.  We're over on the edge next to the <br>
hotel/restaurant.<br>
<br>
For those who haven't exchanged with Wildhair, do!  The carving is <br>
astounding.  Someday, I will carve better . . .<br>
<br>
And, those who haven't exchanged with me, we can do that too, if you <br>
stop by the booth.  Of course!<br>
