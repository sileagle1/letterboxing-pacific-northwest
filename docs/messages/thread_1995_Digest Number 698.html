hard time when I was first looking for them.  I let him know that they<br>
may be missing, so hopefully he'll be able to check on them next time<br>
he's up there.<br>
<br>
As for the Wonderful Tour, I'm not sure which of those boxes are<br>
alive.  I'm going to try to check on them on my next Portland visit.<br>
<br>
It's good to hear that the Mini Cooper is still around.<br>
