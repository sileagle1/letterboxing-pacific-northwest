hard time when I was first looking for them.  I let him know that they<br/>
may be missing, so hopefully he'll be able to check on them next time<br/>
he's up there.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Wonderful Tour, I'm not sure which of those boxes are<br/>
alive.  I'm going to try to check on them on my next Portland visit.<br/>
<br/>
It's good to hear that the Mini Cooper is still around.<br/>

&gt; Windairen and her boyfriend, Wizbang, make particularly difficult<br/>
&gt; clues.  A friend and I attempted three of his in one day and found<br/>
&gt; nothing.  We tried it again the second and still had no luck.  We even<br/>
&gt; got help from him while in the field and couldn't find them.  I think<br/>
&gt; all three of those in Mount Vernon, WA are actually missing, though<br/>
&gt; that status has not been posted on letterboxing.org.  I did manage to<br/>
&gt; find his Mini Cooper box in Estacada, OR, though!  Very exciting,<br/>
&gt; indeed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; These clues are particularly evil. I haven't found all of them<br/>
&gt; &gt; either and haven't been by to check on the ones whose<br/>
&gt; &gt; locations do I know. When the rest of the Traveling Circus<br/>
&gt; &gt; get back to town this summer, we'll have to make a point<br/>
&gt; &gt; of checking up on them. I do know that the final one by<br/>
&gt; &gt; Windairen is long gone, it's hiding place is toast but I'd be<br/>
&gt; &gt; surprised if the first one is gone. Funhog<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone found these boxes lately? I'm curious if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they're still in place.<br/>
