through Schmitz Park. The efforts at restoration and daylighting are <br>
nothing short of amazing!<br>
<br>
Found all three, however, number 2 was an empty box (it looked fairly <br>
new--no tell-tale grub or moss), and we could find no traces of stamp <br>
or logbook anywhere. Since Amanda has no contact information on her <br>
pages, I thought I'd post it here and hope it gets to her.<br>
<br>
The questions beckon though: We tucked the empty box back in its <br>
hiding place--should we have tried to restore some of it? This <br>
certainly doesn't count as a find, right?<br>
