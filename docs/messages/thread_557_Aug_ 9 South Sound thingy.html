We had a GREAT time today and thank all of you for the wonderful food and conversation!  We learned a lot and hope to do this again in the VERY near future!!!<br/>
<br/>
BTW....<br/>
<br/>
Fudrick.... how the heck did you get away without my exchanging YOUR stamp into our book?????  You got ours!  *pouts*<br/>
<br/>
After we departed from the event, Team Rayvenhaus and Wingnut &amp; crew went out on yet another huge adventure to find the Tumwater Falls stamps as well as the newly placed Tacklebox Series...  I will only say this.... Look out, Wingnut and RayvenMom are forces to be reckoned with!!!  *grins and winks at Wingnut*...  (I'll let Steve tell the true stories when he writes his SITREP...)  <br/>
<br/>
Hey Steve... don't forget to tell the story of the HHHD and the IWFD *insert really hysterical laughter here*<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a day that I shall not forget and can only hope that the next "frenzy", as dvn2rckr put it, happens again really soon!!!<br/>
<br/>
Kris of Rayvenhaus<br/>
P(See Steve's)F(See Steve's)X(See Steve's)... Ok, ok... I'm sure you get the point...<br/>

My apologies.  Didn't mean to do that, but with the stamping frenzy going<br/>
on, must have missed out.  Will make up for it at the RavenHausWarming Fest<br/>
coming up this fall :-)<br/>
<br/>
Possibly you will be there when we look for some lost snow dogs, right where<br/>
the clues say you will be?  OK, probably not :-(<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, was a great day!!!  Great company, great stories, even<br/>
greater stamps, the best was the great lunch!<br/>
<br/>
Meet you on the trails.<br/>
