                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well...some are missing and a couple that were reported to be missing <br>
aren't! But overall the letterboxes in the park have done some <br>
languishing. It seems to me that the boxes that are "out in the open" <br>
are all fine yet the ones that are really hidden back in the <br>
trails/forested areas have suffered the greatest! I don't know if its <br>
because they are in "secluded" areas that the local "ner-do-wells" <br>
hang out at or what. <br>
<br>
But here is an update..we tracked down every box in the park. There <br>
were only two that we haven't found before but I didn't have all the <br>
stamps in my logbook so that's why we "powerboxed" the whole shebang. <br>
<br>
FUDRICK'S:<br>
Red Squirrel is completely missing! Along with the hitchiker we <br>
deposited there back in December. So unless anyone has visited the <br>
box since December they both are gone. No traces of anything and we <br>
searched all around the general area.<br>
<br>
Dive On In is alive and well there was even a visitor there earlier <br>
this month! Some names I didn't recognize and I saw that Amanda from <br>
Seattle had visited just recently.<br>
<br>
El Gaucho has departed to whom knows where. The entire area has been <br>
recently "camped" in from what it looks like. IT may of been cleaned <br>
out when the "transient" that apparently camped there was "evicted" <br>
by the parks dept and Tacoma Police Dept. I know that on Jan 2nd it <br>
was alive and well as we launched a hitchhiker there. <br>
<br>
SCOUT DOGS:<br>
Evil Yoda has been kidnapped! He was there on Jan 2nd but was not to <br>
be found anywhere. We went round and round the three trees digging <br>
and looking and scoured the general area. Alas this one really "chaps <br>
my hide" as it was a wonderfully carved stamp! One would of sworn <br>
that it was machine made because the detail work on it was awesome!!!<br>
<br>
CHUCK STRAUB:<br>
Wolfman was reported as missing a couple of months ago when Silver <br>
Eagle was here. He is most definetly gone but the string that he was <br>
hanging by still remains!! We said a breif prayer for his safety and <br>
hope that whomever captured him appreciates him and had better hope <br>
that the Wolfman doesn't rise and bite him/her.<br>
<br>
RAYVENHAUS:<br>
Casper's Cousin Carl was pillaged earlier this winter and to my <br>
knowledge hasn't been replaced.<br>
<br>
Trace Bats: ALIVE AND WELL...the fourth time was a charm. I found it <br>
today after three previous attempts. I actually had to abandon my <br>
attempt around 11am this morning since some kids were fishing right <br>
by where we thought the box may be. So we came back around 1pm and <br>
after two trips to the "twins" and back to the bench to consult the <br>
compass I found the proper set of "tombstones". THis box is in great <br>
shape ...albeit...a little lonely ...most likely the result of <br>
several "missing" reports.<br>
<br>
Grim Reaper: Alive and well...has been found by more "Geocachers" <br>
than "Letterboxers". We pulled our "Snow Daze 2004" HH out of it <br>
since there hasn't been a visitor there since Jan. 2nd when we <br>
launched it. The HH was carved to celebrate the "Week of Snow" we had <br>
at the beginning of 2004!<br>
<br>
Evil Jack O. Lanturn:  I think that he has probably ended up <br>
somewhere with ElGaucho. Since they were in the same "glade". This <br>
was another one of the ones we had found back in Nov/Dec so we knew <br>
exactly where it was.<br>
<br>
Mummy Dearest: Been missing for a long time! Wierd thing is that it <br>
is probably in the most remote area of all!! Heck I grew up playing <br>
in this park and I didn't even know this trail existed.<br>
<br>
Singing for my Supper: Was reported missing but is ALIVE!! In fact I <br>
had to carry the box around for 30 minutes because a family had <br>
settled in at the picnic table and volleyball court nearby as we were <br>
at the bench stamping.<br>
<br>
Finally...I had heard a rumor of another box hidden in the park but <br>
couldn't find any clues to it. So...dvn2r skr...decided after we had <br>
met up and she stamped in the "Hearts Across America" PLB that she <br>
needed to check on a certain "Scaredy Cat" to see if it was still <br>
hiding..sure enough! The kitty was still there all snug behind the <br>
rock!<br>
<br>
All in all it was a fun afternoon of boxing and I am happy to report <br>
that all is not lost int he park and if you talk to the right person <br>
you can get a clue to a "secret" box aka a "Scaredy Cat".<br>

<br>
I am sad to hear that so many of the stamps that were planted for the <br>
event formerly known as Fright Fest '03 are missing.  According to <br>
your scorecard 7 out of 12 boxes are missing.  Yikes!  Evil Yoda and <br>
Wolfman were two of the most elaborately carved stamps I have ever <br>
seen and I'm proud to have them in my book.  All the stamps listed <br>
are great and it is a big loss to the letterboxing community to have <br>
them gone.<br>
<br>
You didn't mention one box that is hidden up there...Jack-O-Lantern <br>
Whippet.  Do you have a status update on it?<br>

Jack-O-Lantern Whippet is still snuggled cozily in it's den! Cute as <br>
a button as usual and asked if mom and I knew anything about a new <br>
round of letterboxing this year sometime around Halloween? Hmm..I <br>
think this Whippet needs a MiniBull companion for those hot summer <br>
nights!! ;)<br>
