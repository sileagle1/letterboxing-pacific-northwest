                    <div class="plaintext-content">Salmon are found in many different locations beyond the Northwest--<br/>
so it isn't as indicative of the region as some other things are.  <br/>
(I harp on the orca simply because it's the 'Pacific' group--the <br/>
only other US regions that could use that image would really be <br/>
Alaska and possibly coastal California if they're lucky enough to <br/>
see them during migration--Puget Sound has the resident orca <br/>
population--of course, BC Canada could run with the orca since <br/>
they've got most of em visible from land!!!).  <br/>
<br/>
For a stamp or a logo for that matter, less is usually more--it's <br/>
easier on the eye. More intricacy usually creates problems.  Love <br/>
the Native designs, though--there are some that don't have as much <br/>
intricacy but still incorporate that 'native culture' feel to them.  <br/>
One route to incorporate many things into one patch is to use a <br/>
primary image--salmon, orca, sun and use the inner design to <br/>
incorporate different regional elements (mountains, animals, hiking <br/>
boot, tree, banana slug, etc).  <br/>
<br/>
Many of the other regional patches incorporate the similar LB <br/>
font/colors--which tie them into the parent entity.  Deviating from <br/>
that segregates the regional group from the parent.  If you spell <br/>
out the lettering, what about using the original LBNA font/colors <br/>
for the letters that correspond to the parent.  Also, the little 'A' <br/>
arrow-like image I think is an orienteering graphic (not certain) <br/>
but I have a feeling it's tied to that hobby in some way--perhaps <br/>
it's simply an arrow pointing north?  I presume Randy Hall would <br/>
know--or whoever designed the LBNA graphic (might be DMS?).  Who <br/>
knows? I figure there's a specific reason why LBNA used that to <br/>
begin with.<br/>
<br/>
East &amp; West sides of the Cascades from both states share the <br/>
mountains--so perhaps a mountain with green/tropical on the left <br/>
(West) base and brown/arid on the (East) right base would <br/>
incorporate both?<br/>
<br/>
Just some things to think about.<br/>
<br/>
The ideas so far are really cool!<br/>

I've got a couple of ideas. How 'bout  incorporating the rolling wheat fields of eastern Washington and Oregon?  One thing that both halves share is, of course, the Columbia River.  The eastern halves have (??) beautiful basalt slabs and spires, the  Frenchman's Coolie Climbing area is stark and awesome.  There's also an excellent letterbox to be had.  I also think of miles of orchards, vineyards, and crops, stunning rocky outcroppings, and painted hills.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I think each design submitted so far is excellent, and each has elements that are common to both sides of the states.  Can't go wrong with trees, mountains, water, or boot prints!  My admiration to all who have submitted ideas...me, I can't even figure out how to post a copy of my signature stamp!<br/>

  A very good point was made to me today that while many of us live in the <br/>

<br/>
I agree with you here, something too busy wold certainly take away<br/>
from the abience of the psort too..<br/>
<br/>
All the ideas and designs are so cool.<br/>
and thanks for sorrecting me about the rain equation, I do forget that<br/>
not ALL the pacific 'north' west (Southwest in BC), is not rainy.<br/>
