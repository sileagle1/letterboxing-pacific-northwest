<br>
Thanks for your note.  I am looking forward to heading up in your area<br>
since I've never been there in my life.  I think I can be persuaded to<br>
leave some letterboxes in my wake!  I plan on bringing my carving stuff<br>
and my letterboxing supplies (i.e., ziplocks, contaners, little memo<br>
pads.  You've planted some that I'm hoping to hunt for and it would be<br>
nice to give you something to look for, as well.  I'm really looking<br>
forward to our trip.  Thanks for placing all your letterboxes so we have<br>
more reasons to go up that way.  <br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>

see that there are some boxes on the way but they are dated.  Does <br>
anyone know if the box hidden at Vantage, WA still exist?  <br>
<br>
Also if you happen to know of any boxes hidden in the Panhandle of <br>
Idaho, let me know.  The ones that I see listed are so old, I don't <br>
know if they are still there.  I don't want to turn my boys off <br>
before we even get started!  <br>
<br>
Also, if I hide boxes in places I won't get back to at least in long <br>
period of time like when I"m on travel trips and such, is that <br>
acceptable?  Or is is something I have to have access often to to do <br>
the upkeep?<br>

Yes there was a forest fire down from Chinook Pass along 123, which <br>
was closed yesterday.<br>
<br>
I am glad you enjoyed The Mountain.  It sounds like the hike up <br>
from "5" was well worth the effort.  I saw a family at Chinook Pass <br>
with 1 quart plastic bucket on strings around their necks for the <br>
very same reason.  Berries everywhere.<br>
<br>
I made blackberry pie Saturday, so all you boxers, take your buckets <br>
next weekend.  The Blackberries should peak on Labor Day Weekend.<br>

Yup. I've only done a short leg, from Juneau to Skagway, Alaska, and it<br>
was GORGEOUS, but it rained quite a bit in the hours we were on, so the<br>
inside glassed in place was seeing a lot of use from everyone. ;)<br>
<br>
Also, you'd want to know that if you're taking your car with you, you<br>
won't have access to it except at ports. They don't let people down onto<br>
the car deck while the ferry's in motion, for safety reasons.<br>

I'm taking my son to Enchanted Forest and it seemed like a fun place  <br>
to plant but don't want to step on anyone's toes if there are some  <br>
there already.<br>
I didn't find any listed. Does anyone know of any there or of any  <br>
near there that we should try for. If not I'll try to find a good  <br>
place for at least one for now.<br>
