Love, love, love figuring out letterbox clues. Unfortunately, when one is traveling and has little free time (but still wants to bag a few boxes), this becomes a challenge. I'm staying near the Portland Airport this week for a meeting. Would love to get some letterboxes during down time, but I'm finding that mapping the letterboxes is not very helpful. I did stumble on the clue for a box that is pretty near-by ("Johnny Baby") that I will try to get. But would love to hear of others in the area that would be doable.<br/>

Thanks for the "cheats"<br/>

I hope you are successful in finding nearby letterboxes.  I had the same 'issue' when visiting my granddaughter in Colorado.  It can be VERY difficult to figure out what letterboxes are near where you are (within the specific area of a city) and this is the only benefit that I can think of for geocaching over letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I live more than two hours south of PDX so I won't be much help in your quest, but I wanted to respond none the less.<br/>

Happy hunting,<br/>
