Whitaker Ponds, marveling at the number of Brown Creepers cruising up the <br>
cottonwoods, I spied a fellow with tell-tale sheets of white paper in his hands and a <br>
knapsack on his back. Shy thing that I am, I naturally asked him if he was looking at <br>
clues. He nodded and I identified myself. I had made the acquaintance of Tony and <br>
his son Edan! While Edan watched the avian show with my binocular, Papa and I <br>
swapped signature stamps.... a red letter day for the Funhog for sure.<br>
