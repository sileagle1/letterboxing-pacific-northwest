                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, in Philadelphia, I picked up 9 hitchhikers bound for <br/>
Seattle and the start of the GREAT HITCHHIKER RACE! Today, Sunday <br/>
September 19th the hitchhikers "caught" rides with 9 letterboxes in <br/>
the Seattle area. None of these are mystery boxes, and I think the<br/>
longest hike is about 3 miles round-trip (if you do<br/>
the whole series). They are all on the Western side of Lake <br/>
Washington and they range from the Shoreline neighborhood in the <br/>
North to Des Moines in the South. All of these hitchhikers are in a <br/>
RACE to reach the East Coast, specifically the South Mountain <br/>
Hitchhiker Hostel, in the South Mountain Nature Preserve in Allentown <br/>
PA.<br/>
<br/>
First out of the gate was LANCE ARMSTRONG! at 8:32am<br/>
PST <br/>
<br/>
Second was BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS at 9:38am PST <br/>
<br/>
Third in the lineup TURBO SLUG at 10:05am PST <br/>
<br/>
Fourth was CAPTAIN TERROR 10:29am PST <br/>
<br/>
Fifth and following closely was SPEED RACER 10:32am PST <br/>
<br/>
Sixth was DALE EARNHARDT 11:24am PST <br/>
<br/>
Seventh, BON JOVI 11:57am PST <br/>
<br/>
Eighth and breathing hard was ON THE RUN FROM MASSACHUSETTS 12:36pm <br/>
PST<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and bringing up the rear in <br/>
<br/>
Ninth place, WWI FLYING ACE at 1:11pm PST <br/>
<br/>
If and when you find any of these Hitchhikers PLEASE contact the <br/>
placer in the log book, notify the Yahoo groups for letterbox <br/>
travellers OR you can contact me, Amanda from Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be tracking the progress of the Hitchhikers across the country <br/>
at:<br/>
<br/>
http://greathhrace.blogspot.com<br/>
<br/>
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT! Do not put these Hitchhikers into Postal <br/>
Letterboxes! We also frown upon mailing the hitchhikers to your <br/>
friends. They should be carried bodily from place to place.<br/>
Thanks so much. These hitchhikers represent some really great <br/>
carvings from East Coast letterboxers! <br/>
