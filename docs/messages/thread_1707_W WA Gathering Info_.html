found at this url: <br>

For those that don;t want to visit yet another web page, I'll post it <br>
here as well:<br>

FF2: Booooo-gie in the Park - Echoes of Times Past<br>
Come and share in the greatest traditions of All Hallows Eve as we <br>
celebrate a northwest tradition, The second annual Halloween Gathering. <br>
This year, we are holding this event at Millersylvania State Park, just <br>
outside Olympia. From I5, take exit #95 and follow the signs to the <br>
entrance. It looks like we'll be in Kitchen #5, right next to the Camper <br>
check in booth, shouldn't be to hard to find is.<br>
<br>
This years event, aptly named FF2: Booooo-gie in the Park - Echoes of <br>
Times Past plans on being much larger than last year's event. Team Chaos <br>
and Team Rayvenhaus are jointly hosting this event and are each planting <br>
a series of boxes for this event.<br>
<br>
What we would like to also offer is for anyone who can not make it to <br>
this gathering but would still like to participate in some way, to go <br>
ahead and carve up a themed stamp, make a box and ship it to us and we <br>
would be happy to plant and maintain it, listing you as the creator of <br>
that box. If you'd like to take us up on this, contact RayvenMom at <br>
rayvenmom 'at' lbworld.org and she'll give you the snail mail address to <br>
send it to.<br>
<br>
We invite everyone that can make it to come and join us and meet some of <br>
the people behind the posts. There will be a potluck so please bring a <br>
covered dish, a salad, something to eat, enough for your group and share <br>
with your friends. Bring your own sodas or other assorted drinks, (minus <br>
alcohol of course, this is a dry park). Team Chaos, Team Rayvenhaus and <br>
CampFireLady are providing burgers and hot dogs with all the fixings for <br>
40 people.<br>
<br>
Although this is a Halloween themed gathering, this is not a costume <br>
party of any sort.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br>
<br>
