Late Breaking News: The Wizard of Oz originally debuted in 1939. <br/>
Just recently in honor of the 65th anniversary of the Independence <br/>
of Munchkins, these darling little people were presented with the <br/>
deed to their name sake park in somewhere in Oregon.  In honor of <br/>
this event the Coroner of Munchkin City was presented with the <br/>
deed.  The event took place on a munchkin sized bridge and the <br/>
ceremony afterwards was held in a field just north west of the <br/>
bridge. The Mayor of Munchkin City, who was also present, but evaded <br/>
photographers, was overheard saying. "I hate all this political <br/>
correctness; they should have just called it Munchkin Park." <br/>
Photographs of the Coroner and the deed were taken near a munchkin <br/>
sized Christmas tree and will be preserved for historical purposes.<br/>
