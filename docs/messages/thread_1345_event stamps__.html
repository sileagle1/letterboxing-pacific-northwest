                    <div class="plaintext-content">Anybody know about any roving event stamps floating around the <br/>
Pacific Northwest region?  Unfortunately, when I surrendered a bunch <br/>
of them at a gathering in the Northeast this past Winter, I think I <br/>
may have seen the last of them as they appear to be caught in the <br/>
cyclical North Atlantic tidal wave of letterboxing events.  Not sure <br/>
how to secure any of these roving event stamps for the 29 May event <br/>
given the limited amount of time I've got remaining in the area <br/>
between now &amp; the event (knowing that I'll be internet-less for the <br/>
next 5 days).<br/>
<br/>
If anybody in this region will be able to track a couple of these <br/>
down, that would be awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anybody have a burning desire to carve an official event <br/>
stamp for the 29 May gathering?  Let me know if you're interested.  <br/>
Otherwise, the alternative will be another one of my miscreants.  Of <br/>
course, I'm always open to the idea of as many event stamps as folks <br/>
want to create for the event.  It turned out really well for the <br/>
VA/MD/DC event in January as the multiple interpretations of the <br/>
event theme proved spectacular!!!<br/>
<br/>
See you in 9 days,<br/>
