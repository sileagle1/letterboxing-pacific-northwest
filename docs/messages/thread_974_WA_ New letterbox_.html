                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, at long last, I have struck again!  But rather than torture your <br/>
poor feet anymore, I hid this letterbox in what may be the easiest <br/>
location yet to reach.  Even easier than my famed Pirate's Treasure <br/>
letterbox--and you all know how easy THAT box is to hike to.  Well, <br/>
this one is even EASIER!  Yes, EASIER!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, as everyone knows, the difficulty of a hike must always be <br/>
inversely proportional to the difficulty of the clue.  Therefore, I <br/>
have made what might be--for some, at least--the most difficult clue <br/>
EVER created!  Mapsurfer, you've met your match!  Legerdemaine, your <br/>
days are numbered.  I, the Green Turtle, have trumped you all!  <br/>
MUHAHAHaHahahaha!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon, while out on a stroll and driving the wonderfully <br/>
deserted freeways of Seattle, I found myself goofing around in <br/>
Redmond and planted a letterbox.  The clue?  There isn't one.  Not <br/>
even the title of the letterbox will help you out this time.  But it <br/>
is findable!<br/>
<br/>
I still created a webpage for it--even a letterbox without a clue <br/>
still needs to be recognized for its existance, I always say, and the <br/>
webpage is at http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/WA/Clueless<br/>
<br/>
But then, I don't know why you'd bother to look at it, since it is a <br/>
clueless letterbox and you won't see a clue there.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Sheeze, I don't know what your problem is.  I hid the letterbox in <br/>
Redmond.  When are you ever out there to hunt down boxes?!  =)<br/>

PS. Clever way to plug your Turtle Soup letterbox.  ;o)<br/>

Hey I've gotten boxes in Tacoma, Longview and Seattle, what makes you <br/>
think I don't ever go out that way... <br/>
<br/>
There is just alot of stuff in Oregon to keep me busy. =)<br/>
<br/>
As for plugging the Turtle Soup box... nah ... it was just a good way <br/>
to swipe a paw at you and give you a hard time. Thinking you out did <br/>
DerMadStamper and Legerdemain .... thats a big claim Ryan... just <br/>
thought I would roast you a litte... and Turtle Soup roasts you well <br/>

<br/>
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong!  I didn't say I outdid Der Mad <br/>
Stamper, but rather Mapsurfer!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Although now that you mention it, I've outdone him too.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it's a pretty tough clue, I think, and I doubt most people <br/>
will figure out the clue.  I just wanted to drum up interest--a <br/>
challenge, if you will--to see if ANYONE can figure out the clue.  <br/>
That's what all the boasting was for.  Doesn't mean I really believe <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
If nobody ever does figure out the clue, though, that's okay.  Most <br/>
of my boxes are very neglected by the large majority of the <br/>
letterboxing community.  (Usually because of the long hike or drive <br/>
required to reach them, or else I've made the clues so annoyingly <br/>
difficult, nobody wants to hunt it down.)  So I expect my boxes to be <br/>
neglected.  It makes the find that much more special for the people <br/>
that do hunt down one of my boxes.  =)<br/>
