   <br>
  Would there be anyone out there who might have any clues to any of the letterboxes at the Portland zoo?  I was planning to take my niece, Baby Deer, there to do some hunting tomorrow (8/9/06), but can't get to any of the clues.  Funhog, I'm sure you have one planted there, huh?  Any chance anyone might be able to help this sad group out?<br>
   <br>
  Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer.<br>

and then click on "view cache..." Wapiti is most likely there. Packy's<br>
missing but I carved a replacement stamp and made a new book yesterday<br>
and it will be replaced soon. Windairen's Winking Eagle may be<br>
missing. Last time I looked it was there but grounds keepers had moved<br>
it into a nearby cluster of cedars. Good Luck.<br>
