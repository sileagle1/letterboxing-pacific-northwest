is offering their world-famous letterboxing class. <br/>
The world-famous teacher is, once again, moi. If <br/>
you have any interest in gaining world-fame of <br/>
your own as a student, sign up for this session. I <br/>
have been told by past attendees who were <br/>
experienced letterboxers that this class was <br/>
enjoyable for them, that I should be sure that <br/>
people don't think it's for beginners only. The <br/>
dates for this session are July 7, 14 and 16 and <br/>
further information can be found on the web at: <br/>
http://www.ci.longview.wa.us/parks_rec/family.html   <br/>
Check it out. Funhog<br/>
