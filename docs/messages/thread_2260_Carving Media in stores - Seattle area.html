<br>
For those of you in the Seattle area, one of my favorite places for <br>
boxing supplies is the UW Bookstore.  You can park in their parking <br>
lot (I think it's on 15th Ave and 43rd St?).  They will validate <br>
parking - so I think you can get up to an hour free, even if you're <br>
just browsing, and up to 2 hours free if you buy something.<br>
<br>
If you go downstairs, they have the "cuts like butter" Staedtler <br>
Mastercarve (my favorite) in lots of different sizes (I like <br>
4x4x0.5), Speedball carving tools, lots of cool little notebooks <br>
(lined & unlined), ink pads of all sizes & colors, etc.  I'm not sure <br>
this is the cheapest place to buy everything, but most things are <br>
competitively priced - and they have a large selection compared to <br>
most Michael's I've been to.<br>
<br>
Check it out if you're in the area.  I understand there's also at <br>
least one box within easy walking distance, too!  =)<br>
