Looks as if SWSP sustained major damage from this winter's storms.  <br/>
The upper and most of the lower parking lot is open, as is the beach <br/>
and the trail above from the upper lot.<br/>
However, the majority of the park is completly closed includeing the <br/>
trails, picnic shelters on the lower level and the campground.<br/>
The bridge that goes over the ravine (Marine View Drive) is blocked <br/>
off to all car and foot traffic.  The ranger said that the wind <br/>
snapped support cables and the water damage eroded the earth under the <br/>
south side of the bridge.<br/>
This means the larger portion of the boxes are blocked to <br/>
access...BUT...SHH's "Flowers For Mom" is perfectly accessable, <br/>
provides stunning views of the Puget Sound and is an excellent carve!<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
