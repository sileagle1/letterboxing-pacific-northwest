                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep, I heard you're coming out this way.  I just don't know if 'we'll' <br/>
be here then which is why I've hesitated to plan something yet.  Do you <br/>
have your dates yet?  You'll be in Seattle?  If so, what side of town?  <br/>
I've got a few 'ideas' up my sleeve already but I'll need some more <br/>
time to see if I can coordinate anything.<br/>
<br/>
We could do a dinner/or late afternoon thing (depending on when you're <br/>
in town).  Based on our recently affirmed La Nina affliction, I'd lean <br/>
toward doing something indoors now as anything outdoors is sure to be <br/>
waterlogged.<br/>
<br/>
I do have an idea about a train/brunch outing for the near future but <br/>
not sure if anybody else would be interested in that.  It'd run about <br/>
$45-65 per adult (depending upon brunch or dinner) and 2 children are <br/>
free per adult--at least through April that is, then they gotta pay, <br/>
too.  It'd be an entire afternoon or evening event that'd end with wine <br/>
tasting though and wouldn't involve much letterboxing unless folks <br/>
brought 'personal travelers' for which we must solve clues.  So that <br/>
might be an option for your visit or we could do something <br/>
less 'involved'.<br/>
<br/>
dlphinus of the Adventure Seekers<br/>
<br/>
(by the way, here's the deal with the name change--dvn2r ckr <br/>
<adventures seeker=""> had always been our group name until I could come <br/>
up with a personal trail name--I'd had the name Delphinus in mind for <br/>
ages but yahoo ids are difficult to come by since every country on this <br/>
planet can create accounts there.  Finally, after 3-1/2 years, decided <br/>
to go with D<a umlaut="">lphinus instead so I could have my own Yahoo <br/>
userid without the 5 digit extension required for 'popular' names.  'A <br/>
umlaut' in German is the same sound as e in Latin so it works.  Since <br/>
most yahoo things don't allow umlauts I just spell it out 'ae' <br/>
instead.  So that's the deal with that.  I'll transition over to the <br/>
new email account in time.  Otherwise, same 'bat' dolphin, same bat <br/>
channel--that is, of course, until we move across the country and then <br/>
the frequency will change, too).  ;)<br/>

ME too!  Guitarzan and I are leaving for Vancouver on Feb 14 and hope<br/>
to meet up with CSB ( a boxer in BC) on Feb 19, likey near Vanc.  At<br/>
some point in March we hope to visit the Seattle area and would be<br/>
thrilled to meet some PNW boxers.  Or if you would like to travel<br/>
northward we will be in or near Vancouver (city) until Feb 20th and<br/>
then off to Vancouver Island and Salt Spring Island.  Sorry we can't<br/>
join you for the Spring Flinger - maybe something earlier?   Norasta<br/>
