Last night I dreamed that a crazed letterboxer got upset because no one was<br>
visiting their boxes. So they planted a bomb and carved the location of the<br>
bomb into a stamp and left it in "a box somewhere in Oregon". They issued an<br>
email to the LbPNW list and gave the letterboxing community 24 hours to find<br>
the stamp that told the location of the bomb so it could be disarmed. I am<br>
happy to say that the fast acting PNW community all jumped right on it,<br>
organized themselves and managed to stamp into every box in Oregon in just<br>
under 14 hours. Pretty cool huh?<br>
<br>
Anyone else have strange letterboxing dreams?<br>

But what's wrong with that?!?<br>
 <br>
Also, should the world ever be plauged with such a dastardly villain as that, we will certainly be prepared to help mankind with our unique abilities, and quite prepared now that you have gotten us thinking outside the "box."  (teehee...I didn't even realize that was going to be a pun...)<br>

Every box in Oregon in half a day?  Wow.  Now that would be a challenge.<br>
