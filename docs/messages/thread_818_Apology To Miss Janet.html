<br>
I do not know what overcame me this morning or what lead me to slap <br>
your so delicately gloved hand and say that you were a figment of <br>
Ryan's imagination, as well all well know that Ryan is not that <br>
creative that he could conjure up someone as divine and well mannered <br>
as yourself.   I meant no offense to you, and I do hope that you will <br>
accept my apology.  I shall never ever say such things again; instead <br>
I will only say that you and Ryan have a very personal relationship. <br>
(Almost as if you were one in the same) (But I didn't really say that <br>
I only thought it, hence the brackets, and therefore won't have to <br>
apologize for it later)<br>
<br>
I do hope that you will accept my most humbled apologies.<br>

<br>
That's okay, deary, I understand.  I've been teaching etiquette <br>
posting techniques for many years, and I've seen it all.  Oh, if you <br>
could have only seen some of the stupid things Ryan has said and <br>
posted before he went through my course.  He really is quite an <br>
embarassment to himself sometimes.<br>
<br>
So no hard feelings, dear, and no apologies necessary.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Miss Janet<br>
<br>
