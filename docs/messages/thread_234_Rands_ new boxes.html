City boxes hidden by the newest carver on the block. I am pleased to<br/>
say that they are both cute little hand carved stamps. The Fun Guy<br/>
looks downright psychedelic with the purple and orange color combo I<br/>
used for him in my log. Thanks for the fun. Funhog<br/>

Paisley &amp; her husband &amp; my group would have had better timing, we'd have been able <br/>
to party--we all visited Atkinson Park at different times today!<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo for the Rands!  I brought along a friend who was so inspired by the <br/>
idea of boxing that she had to carve her personal stamp before we'd left my <br/>
house...from her reaction to these first two boxes, I'd say we've brought another <br/>
PNWer into the club.  Watch for Ladybug and Babybug in the logs.<br/>
