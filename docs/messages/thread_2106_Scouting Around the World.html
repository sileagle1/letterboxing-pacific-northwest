Park.  This is NOT a difficult series to find.  Stamp<br>
size must be no more than 2.5 inches x 2.5 inches. <br>
Feel free to find this series - it's kid friendly<br>
because it's aimed at Girl Scout troops.  <br>
<br>
The clues are up and running at LBNA.....<br>

If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br>
