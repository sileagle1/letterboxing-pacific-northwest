  You can get there from the 'Search for boxes' link.  I'm not going to post a<br/>
link in this message because who knows where the DNS has reached and hasn't (my<br/>
DNS servers haven't been propagated to yet).<br/>
<br/>
You can search by:<br/>
State<br/>
Word / phrase in the box title<br/>
Starting and/or ending placement dates<br/>
Box owner (current maintainer)<br/>
<br/>
  All combinations are valid.  If you wanted to find boxes placed during the<br/>
first week of the year, you could put a start date of 1/1/03 and an end date of<br/>
1/8/03.  Or . . . maybe you'd like to know all boxes in Connecticut that have<br/>
the word "HILL" in the box name (there are 18, in case you're curious.) <br/>
<br/>
  Unfortunately, I did not require users to create a unique name, so we have six<br/>
Amy accounts, five Marks, and a plethora of names with four users registered.<br/>
Don't forget that you can always change your account name in Member Services,<br/>
via the 'Edit your Membership Details' link. There will be no email addresses<br/>
attached to user names, so don't ask "If I could search by email address that<br/>
would really help..."  You can find one of said persons boxes and search on its<br/>
name to find their username.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, if you've created two accounts, they'll both show up there, so you'll<br/>
probably want all your boxes moved to one account before you delete the extra<br/>
account. I'll be happy to help people out with mass transferring their boxes<br/>
between accounts like that.  Just tell me what email address should be deleted<br/>
and which should be left.  Please send your request to me off-list or to the<br/>
webmasters (webmasters at letterboxing.org ) so we don't clog this list with<br/>
service requests.  <br/>
<br/>
  Comments on the search functionality appreciated. <br/>
