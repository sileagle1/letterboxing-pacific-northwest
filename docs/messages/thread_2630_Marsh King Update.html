<br>
This is to let you all know that I have retired my first letterbox, the <br>
Marsh King (Spokane, WA) so if you are holding clues, please discard them.<br>
<br>
I have had a few missing reports, so we checked on it this weekend.  It was <br>
right where it should be.  We originally planted it off a small side trail <br>
in Liberty Lake County Park.  Since then, it appears the park has placed <br>
some logs and brush in an effort to prevent use of the side trail. <br>
Therefore, I have pulled the box so that I don't contribute to the further <br>
damage they are apparently trying to prevent.  I may or may not find a new <br>
home for it sometime in the future.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

  God, make me brave for life; oh, braver than this. Let me straighten after pain, as a tree straightens after rain, shining and lovely again. God, make me brave for life; much braver than this. As the blown grass lifts, let me rise, from sorrow with quiet eyes, knowing Your way is wise. God, make me brave, life brings such blinding things. Help me to keep my sight; help me to see aright that out of dark comes light. ~ Author Unknown<br>
