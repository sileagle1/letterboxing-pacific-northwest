No brainer--DC Pagans, Unite!  I think it was planted by Rev Aloysius <br/>
Holden (sp?).  Some runners-up in the PNW area would include Funhog's <br/>
Ace of Fun, just about all of Der Mad Stamper's boxes and many of Trial <br/>
N Error &amp; Evil Glenn's boxes (just cuz they made ya think).  Many of <br/>
those took several months of 'backoffice' pondering (thinking about <br/>
them when working on other things/sleeping &amp; ultimately solving them in <br/>
the middle of the night several months after first looking at the <br/>
clue).  And you can never forget Legerdemaine--that character's boxes <br/>
are incredible works of genius--especially loved The Big Apple series!  <br/>
Green Tortuga's got a bunch that take a while to solve, as well--<br/>
keeping those brain cells active and all.<br/>

Green Tortuga's Buffalo Warrior.  I kept clueing into the wrong words.  When<br/>
I finally figured it out though it was a "duh!" moment.  I was so excited to<br/>
find it, but then I couldn't get out to it for various reasons--seasons,<br/>
travel time, trail closures.  It took me over two years to get it.  Then<br/>
when I finally got out there, I kept seeing the wrong things thinking "it<br/>
might be that."  I went miles off-track before I found it right where the<br/>
clue said it should have been.  Boy did I ever do a happy dance when I<br/>
finally found that one.  It was a great feeling!<br/>
