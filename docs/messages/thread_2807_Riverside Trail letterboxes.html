                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd recently been alerted that box #2 on Riverside Trail near <br>
Ripplebrook, was missing.  I checked on them this last Tuesday, and <br>
sure enough, it was.  There were also numerous downed trees hiding the <br>
side-trail to #2.  So I've removed it from the clues, and you now have <br>
the option of making the hike somewhat less than the original 8.2 <br>
miles, since you need not go all the way to Riverside Campground for <br>
that box.  Now the hike is around a mere 6.5 miles around trip!  Easy <br>
cheesy.  Thank you Dogglesnoffer for the heads-up.<br>

There are a few ups and downs but nothing too demanding. This would be<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Indeed it is an incredibly beautiful trail!<br>
There's some big ol' trees out there! Lot's of trillium (purple!) and orchid's in may / june as <br>
well.<br>
<br>
We did a little rockhounding on the side of the river along the way and found lot's of <br>
petrified wood and one really big chunk (as big as my fist) of agate! <br>
If you get sore from all the hiking you can drive over to Bagby hot springs and soothe <br>
those weary muscles.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the great quest.<br>
