                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too got out letterboxing yesterday.  I had the distinct pleasure to meet<br/>
up with Bookworm and Sleepy Whippet.  They are fantastic people.  They even<br/>
helped my daughter come up with her letterboxing name.  But all being said,<br/>
I have to say that the 30 minute chat I had with them before heading into<br/>
the hills was the best part of the day.  After chatting with them and<br/>
stamping into Protection, (Where Bookworm found a hitchhiker but let me move<br/>
it, Thank you Bookworm, I didn't realize JUST how nice you were being!) we<br/>
headed onto the trail of the Jurassic Park series.  WELLL, 1.5 hours later<br/>
we had found only box 3 and were hopelessly lost.  It took us a good long<br/>
time to find our way back to the parking lot.  We finally did and found the<br/>
Clackamas River stamp before calling it a night.<br/>
<br/>
I'm now headed out to plant some more boxes AND to get the Turtle Soup box.<br/>
My husband and I spent an hour breaking pandora's clue last night, so I'll<br/>
be danged if I'm not getting it today!<br/>

4 boxes in one day would be like hitting a gold mine.... We are lucky<br/>
to get one or two  box in a day.  We are running out of boxes to get over here.<br/>
We spend most of our LBing time plating boxes unless we come to the<br/>
valley.<br/>
