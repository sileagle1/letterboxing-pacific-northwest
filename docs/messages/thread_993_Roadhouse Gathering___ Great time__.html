great time I had!  It was sure nice to hear that Kyle Spinks isn't <br/>
against us placing boxes, glad to hear that they fully support us.  <br/>
It was also soooo nice to see everyone again, and meet some new <br/>
faces!!!! Thanks to Funhog for planning this event, wish we could <br/>
have stayed till closing!  Thank you also to the person who paid for <br/>
my Ruby Red Beer!!  I got caught up in stamping and it crossed my <br/>
mind as I pulled into the driveway that I didn't pay for it, so <br/>
whoever it was, I owe you one at the next gathering!! ( sorry, I <br/>
feel really bad!)<br/>
Looking forward to the next time, this was just too fun, I only wish <br/>
that my brother could have been there to meet all of you!<br/>
Talk later<br/>

earlier, or I could have squeaked out a few more minutes to talk to <br/>
him and Amanda!  Maybe next time!  It was great to finally meet so <br/>
many of you!  Hope to see you all on the trails!  Wingnut<br/>
