<br/>
Yesterday John and I were down in Lincoln City for SOLV's bi-annual<br/>
beach clean up.  While there I thought I would check on the Devil's Lake<br/>
Letterbox.  I've had reports that it had gone missing.  Each time I<br/>
checked on it previously, those reports were just rumors and the box was<br/>
safely tucked in where it was placed.<br/>
<br/>
However, now the rumors have become true.  The Devil's Lake State Park<br/>
Letterbox is truly gone.  BOO HOO.  I lament the demise of this<br/>
letterbox.  I will remove the clues when I am able to get on an actual<br/>
computer.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those of you who made me aware of its current state.  I'm<br/>
sorry you went looking for a box that wasn't there.  I hate to<br/>
disappoint people.  I always liked that stamp.  I placed it in my early<br/>
years of letterboxing when I was very eager and excited about the sport.<br/>
Perhaps sometime I will replace it, but for now it remains only as an<br/>
image in some of our logbooks.  Thanks to those who have sought it out.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, that was one of your best stamps, I think.  :)  Not that you <br/>
don't always make great stamps, but if there was ever a "bad side" <br/>
to the Great Pailsey Orca, that's the only time I ever saw you let <br/>
it out.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
That's a pity it's missing, though.  It's one of the oldest boxes <br/>
I've found!<br/>
