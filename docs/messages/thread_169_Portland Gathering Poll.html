Northwesterners to vote in to determine the best day for the proposed <br/>
Portland Gathering this Summer.  Make sure you indicate all of the <br/>
weekends that would NOT work for you.  This way we can eliminate all <br/>
the bad dates and concentrate on only the ones that most people could <br/>
attend.  <br/>
<br/>
Currently it is looking like July 11 or 12,  Aug 9 or 10, and Aug 23 <br/>
or 24 are the best dates.  This is with only 7 people casting their <br/>
votes however, so I know that there are alot of you out there who <br/>
still need to put in your dates.  Please log in and cast your votes <br/>
today.  The poll is setup to close in about 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and looking forwart to meeting all you OR boxers soon,<br/>
