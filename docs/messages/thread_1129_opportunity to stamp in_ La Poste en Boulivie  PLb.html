Camp Fire Lady, this means you get to stamp in "out of turn" right <br>
along with me! <br>
<br>
Anyone else who wants to stamp in, is welcome to as well.  Even if <br>
you don't stamp in, you should see this stamp! It's an amazing work <br>
of art.  Even after two days, I'm still stunned by the skill it took <br>
to carve.<br>
<br>
BTW:  I promised to send it back to Mark & Sue Peppe ASAP so they'll <br>
have it in time for their event on Leap Day. So I'm sending it out <br>
via Priority mail to them on Sat (2/21) morning ... if that doesn't <br>
work, I'll upgrade to FedEx.<br>
<br>
Bindle Bum and I are going to check on our Kent Trails box this <br>
weekend.  Last time we looked there was a hitch hiker in there.  If <br>
it's still there, I'm planning to bring that with me as well.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing all of you soon!<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

that I'm going to send on it's way with you.<br>
<br>
And I carved a box to go home with you.<br>

Don't forget everyone, if you're planning on getting together with us on<br>
Friday evening at The Spaghetti Factory in Vancouver you need to let Willow<br>
know!<br>
