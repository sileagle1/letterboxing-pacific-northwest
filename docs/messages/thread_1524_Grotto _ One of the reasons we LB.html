                    <div class="plaintext-content">My in-laws were in town from Sacramento and I thought they would like <br>
to see The Grotto (they are Catholic & I know they would like some of <br>
the symbolism.)  Besides, it's just a beautiful garden!<br>
<br>
I wanted to mention something that has been mentioned before.  One of <br>
the reasons we letterbox is to see new wonderful places -- sometimes <br>
gardens, views, little known trails, etc.<br>
<br>
Because Grotto LB was the second box my husband & I had done, I had <br>
FINALLY come to the Grotto other than Christmas Lights time.<br>
<br>
Every December I would vow to go to the Grotto during the spring or <br>
summer.  Because of this wonderful LB, we did last year in June!<br>
<br>
I was able to tell my in-laws how beautiful the garden was instead of <br>
just having heard of it.<br>
<br>
While we were there, I grabbed the box and my husband & I looked at <br>
the loggings since we had been there.  What fun!  It was the first <br>
time we had ever visited a box a second time.<br>
<br>
Hope any Portland people or visitors catch this box.  It's beautiful <br>
& find to find.<br>

The fact that no one understands you doesn't make you an artist.<br>
