<br>
Many owners of hitchhikers love to hear reports of their travels, but <br>
relatively few letterboxers ever report them (I'd be surprised if one in <br>
ten finders ever reported back to me about the travels of my hitchhikers). <br>
If the owner of the hitchhiker asks for reports in the hitchhiker log, then <br>
it's common courtesy to provide them; if the owner doesn't provide any <br>
means for reports (like an email address) or doesn't ask for reports, then <br>
you're off the hook.<br>
