                    <div class="plaintext-content">...to have a fantastic collection of Double Tree stamp impressions! I<br>
just returned home from three days at Olallie Lake where I<br>
rendezvoused with the prolific stamp carver/enthusiastic hiker Double<br>
Tree. Since she first joined our wacky hobby, she has been seeding the<br>
Olallie Lake Scenic area with letterboxes, many of which still await a<br>
finder! Every one is a treasure and they show her progression as a<br>
carver from her earliest efforts to those she created just this year. <br>
<br>
This part of the Mount Hood National Forest is gorgeous, with many<br>
trails to discover. Most are easy to moderate in difficulty and would<br>
be just great to enjoy with kids. The views of Mount Jefferson are<br>
everywhere with peekaboos at Mount Hood here and there. Lakes both<br>
small and large sparkle through the trees on every trail. <br>
<br>
There are yurts and cabins for rent, both free and paid forest service<br>
campgrounds and plenty of great backpacking sites. The drive is about<br>
two and half hours from Portland but well worth every minute. If you<br>
make the  journey you will return home with lots of wonderful stamps<br>
by Double Tree, Logos, Mudstumpers and Pandora. I certainly did. Funhog<br>

in the area, I've added one more for those who love a scenic hike to <br>
the top of a butte for breathtaking views.  Potato Butte now has a <br>
box at the top of it.  The views of Mt. Hood, Mt. Jefferson, Olallie <br>
Butte and the surrounding hills are outstanding.  You can also <br>
examine the fascinating red soil, red & orange volcanic rocks, and <br>
of course the POTATOES! <br>
