                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a sad, funny story for you about this ethereal 'place'.  Back in <br/>
Aug/Sep 2000, we rerouted a cross-country trip about 1,000 miles of our <br/>
way just to go to this spot--TRKEE's idea as it's right up his Star <br/>
Trek fanatic ally.  We show up to the area early one morning and the <br/>
place is closed for 'maintenance' for 2 days--something they said that <br/>
occurs once every decade or so.  Talk about a big bummer.  Ever since I <br/>
saw these and Green Tortuga's clues explode into space I knew we just <br/>
had to return to the spot.  It's just not all that easy to get to--and <br/>
after our first 'frustrating attempt' I fear that we'll pick the <br/>
next '2 day maintenance' period they choose for the day we reattempt a <br/>
visit.  ;)  They sound like wonderful boxes!  Can't wait to seek them <br/>
out!<br/>
