                    <div class="plaintext-content">Question for you Seattle Area folk (and former Sea-folk).<br>
 <br>
Now that my baby boy Kasey is 8 weeks, we're starting to settle into a<br>
pattern. dare I say it. even a "schedule".  *gasp*  <br>
 <br>
As a new momma, I'm getting confident enough (or would that be stir-crazy<br>
enough?) to leave the house with the baby. for things *other* then doctor's<br>
appointments.  ;-)<br>
 <br>
The weather is finally taking a turn for the better, and my body is ready to<br>
get moving once again.  So I'm looking to go on stroller-walks.<br>
 <br>
I'm looking for nice places in the area to walk with my stroller.  I have a<br>
nice cadillac-like stroller.  It's not a jogging stroller, nor would it be<br>
suited for (dirt) trail walking.  <br>
 <br>
The Burk-Gilman Trail is practically in my front yard, so that will get<br>
used.  Greenlake is an option, and maybe Alki?<br>
 <br>
What other suitable places might I go?<br>
 <br>
I'm looking for the following:<br>
~ Paved path<br>
~ Relatively level<br>
~ Shade/Partial Shade is a bonus<br>
 <br>
Thanks everyone in advance!<br>
 <br>
 ~ Mischief ~<br>
 <br>
PS.  I've done the Redmond-Woodinville portion of the Burk-Gilman Trail, and<br>
will shortly be exploring the Woodinville-Bothell portion.  Do you have a<br>
favorite stretch of this trail you'd recommend?<br>

Try Gene Coulon Park in Renton.  Great, flat and paved walking path <br>
along the shore of Lake Washington--so water activity as well as <br>
birds.  Even a letterbox (if it's still there) that isn't too far <br>
off the beaten path.  ;)<br>
<br>
http://www.ci.renton.wa.us/commserv/parks/coulon.htm<br>
<br>
I was also thinking (this is more Amanda's territory here) of the <br>
stroll along Alki Beach (with lunch at Alki Bakery--one of our must <br>
dos when we're in the area) and the paved path along the Sound at <br>
Lincoln Park (also West Seattle area).  Somehow there's a way to <br>
park and take a fairly flat path to the trail along the water--I'm <br>
thinking you have to park further South sort of near the Fauntleroy <br>
ferry terminal? <br>
<br>
Cedar River bike trail--not far from Gene Coulon Park--also in <br>
Renton on the way to Maple Valley.  Find the clues to my 'Ouch!' <br>
letterbox and it'll lead you to the parking area for the trail <br>
there. It's also a Rails to Trails trail so it's guaranteed to be <br>
flat.  ;)<br>
<br>
I'll keep thinking of other places...<br>
<br>
Congratulations on Kasey!!!  That's so exciting!<br>

Being the walker that I am, I've walked quite a few of the urban<br>
trails around Seattle. =) Berke-Gilman is probably my favorite because<br>
much of it is shaded. The Sammamish River Trail has practically no<br>
shade at all--it's pretty miserable on a hot, sunny day! Might be a<br>
nice place on a cool, overcast day, though.<br>
<br>
The Alki Trail is beautiful and nice because it doesn't cross any<br>
streets where you have to dodge cars, but it's EXTREMELY crowded on<br>
weekends. It's a great weekday walk, though, which I do often. =)<br>
There's not much shade, either.<br>
<br>
The Duwamish River Trail has a couple of nice spots, but most of it is<br>
unshaded and not especially scenic since it follows along the<br>
industrial section of town. I like it only because I'm just fascinated<br>
by that port stuff. Dreaming of all the exotic places those containers<br>
may have come from and watching the machinery that moves it all around.<br>
<br>
There's also my Seattle Walking Tour letterbox that stroller<br>
accessible. ;o) Give you a reason to walk around downtown for awhile!<br>
I'm kind of fond of walking along the waterfront late at night when<br>
the streets and sidewalks aren't very crowded, though if you read in<br>
an earlier post, there's one particular plaque that I wouldn't<br>
recommend getting late at night when the homeless people are trying to<br>
get some shut eye.<br>
<br>
The Lakes to Lakes trail system has some stroller friendly areas, but<br>
it's NOT very well marked. I left from near Lake Sammamish and tried<br>
to walk to Lake Washington. Imagine my embarrassment when, after a<br>
half hour of walking, I found myself in the exact spot I started at!<br>
And that happened not once, but TWICE! *shaking head* I did eventually<br>
make it to Lake Washington, but it took a couple of hours longer than<br>
it should have. =) Take a map of the area with you if you try that<br>
one. It would have helped me out a lot!<br>

<br>
Hey, it just occurred to me--that sounds more like where the Sammamish<br>
River Trail is supposed to be? I thought Burk-Gilman ended near<br>
Bothell then the trail became the Samanish River Trail at that point.<br>
The rest of the Burk-Gilman trail is quite nice, though! Most of it is<br>
well-shaded and largely avoids busy street crossings.<br>
<br>
Especially if you do the Alki Trail, let me know and maybe I can walk<br>
with you for a bit. =) I do that one probably once or twice a week! I<br>
know it very well. *nodding*<br>
<br>
Happy stroller-friendly trails!<br>

Ya, you're right.  I tend to just call the whole thing the  Burk-Gilman<br>
trail.  In truth I guess I've only walked the Sammish River portion... and<br>
ya, it's hot on days like today!  =P<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Had another idea--the Ballard Locks.  Park on either the south <br>
(Magnolia) or north (Ballard) side and then walk to the opposite side.  <br>
It's mostly flat, great flower garden, good food on the northern side <br>
if you're into fish n' chips type food, interesting to see the fish <br>
ladder activity and the kingfishers and great blue herons looking for <br>
their next meals--not to mention the boat activity through the locks <br>
themselves.  It's a place where I spend many of my lunchtimes when I'm <br>
working up that way.  Shade may be a bit more difficult to find on the <br>
locks themselves but there's great shady parts throughout the garden on <br>
the north and the park areas on the south.<br>
