<br/>
After a visit with my folks in Montana, I'll be heading back to Oregon<br/>
around Aug 13 via I-90 to Seattle and south to Portland on I-5, if anyone<br/>
along that route would care to meet up. I'll be camping and taking my time,<br/>
so would anyone like to do a mini-meet or two? I love meeting up with other<br/>
letterboxers, and this seems to be a great opportunity. The 13th is a Monday<br/>
so I imagine evening will be work best for most, but if the weekend works<br/>
better, I can leave a day or so early. I'm on vacation, so I'm flexible.<br/>
<br/>
Also, are there any boxes I should not miss along that route?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
