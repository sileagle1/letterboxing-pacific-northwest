<br/>
John and I went out for a beautiful end-of-summer stroll in a beautiful<br/>
city park.  We took the clues for Taste of Central Oregon with us and<br/>
found this incredible letterbox placed by 4DToes.  I do believe we will<br/>
have to get over the mountain to get more of the letterboxes placed by<br/>
this artistically-inclined clan.  I just love John Fleshman's carving<br/>
style!!!<br/>
<br/>
As for trailhead break-ins, it's really hit or miss and not necessarily<br/>
the destiny of one particular spot.  <br/>
<br/>
We've never been broken into while letterboxing since we started back in<br/>
2000.  However, John's Jeep was broken into at Lolo Pass in Zig Zag<br/>
while we were off hiking.  And my entire truck was physically stolen<br/>
right from the driveway of my apartment next to my neighbor's window in<br/>
my "safe" Laurelhurst  neighborhood a few years after I first moved back<br/>
to Portland.  It doesn't matter.  <br/>
<br/>
You can cry and be an alarmist and pout "Why me?" and what it will get<br/>
you is tons of sympathy because then you find out what a common<br/>
occurrence it is.  Everyone will come up to you and say, "Dang!  That's<br/>
terrible!  When my car got broke into they took this and this and this"<br/>
And "They screwed up the lock so bad I couldn't even open the trunk till<br/>
I got it repaired when mine got vandalized" or "When it happened to me<br/>
they busted out the window to the extent..." etc. etc. etc.  It is a<br/>
complete affront and violation of your private space when your vehicle<br/>
is busted into or stolen, but at the same time it's more a matter of<br/>
when, not if it will happen to your vehicle.  If it hasn't happened to<br/>
you so far, then count your blessings!  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing you may want to consider...at least you have a car that<br/>
can be broken into.  Some people are not so well off and don't even have<br/>
that much.  We should count ourselves lucky to have material goods and<br/>
have our basic needs met, I think.  Just something to think about.<br/>
There are lots who are way less fortunate.  The things that really count<br/>
in life are the intangibles.  We shouldn't get too bent out of shape<br/>
when money and things go fleeting out of our hands sometimes.  At least<br/>
we had that money and those things at some point in our lives and if we<br/>
really want to it to be, it can be replaced.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think we should concentrate on what we can give rather than<br/>
what is taken from us.  It can give us a sense of humility, empathy, and<br/>
an opportunity to be good and share with others.  It comes back to us in<br/>
different ways and instead of our feeling sorry for ourselves over what<br/>
we've lost, we can give ourselves a chance to be empowered and<br/>
enlightened by the uplifting act of giving.  Giving can negate what's<br/>
taken and replace a bad feeling with a good one.<br/>

<br/>
Your car can be broken into anywhere--not just the dinky trail <br/>
heads.  I've seen cars that had been broken into in the parking lot <br/>
of an apartment complex in good neighborhoods.  It's like the Paisley <br/>
Orca said--if you own a car, eventually, someone, somewhere, is going <br/>
to want to break into it.  There are things you can do to help reduce <br/>
that risk including where you choose to park it, but in the end, <br/>
everything you can do may not be enough.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, even as 'common' as break-ins are, they're still <br/>
relatively uncommon.  I've parked at trailheads hundreds of times and <br/>
my car has never been broken into, including the trailhead where your <br/>
car was hit.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions about not leaving valuables in plain view in a car isn't <br/>
a condemnation against you, but rather a suggestion for how you and <br/>
other on this board might reduce risk of break-ins in the future.  <br/>
You're solution (i.e. Don't go!) may not be an acceptable solution <br/>
for others on this board that still want to get the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I'm willing to pay the price of a break-in for many years of happy <br/>
hiking on beautiful, wonderful trails.  =)  But I certainly try not <br/>
to make my car or anything into too appealing to thieves, either....<br/>

I think you will quickly find on letterboxing lists that things you least<br/>
expect to cause a stir will cause a Stir. The other thing you will probably<br/>
find is that being the type that just has to have the last word will<br/>
probably get you no where fast. Not that you are, just an observation.  I<br/>
don't think Paisly Orca meant any offense, in fact, having met her, I know<br/>
she didn't she is a very kind hearted and soft spoken individual. <br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day Lily I think where you are sensing the argument from<br/>
is that a lot of us on the list feel that asking the place to be accountable<br/>
for your personal responsibility is a bit outlandish.  Things like this<br/>
happen in life, they happen to everyone, when I lived in California I had my<br/>
house broken into 5 times. <br/>
<br/>
I think the other point that people are trying to make that you are<br/>
overlooking, is that regardless of what the officer on the scene may have<br/>
told you... LOTS and LOTS of letter boxers have parked in the very same<br/>
place that you did, got the very same box you got, and not had their car<br/>
broken into.  So asking a placer to change their clues to include a warning<br/>
because your car got broken into when 75 other people (that is a guess) had<br/>
no problems there is statistically invalid. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with you absolutely that you are a free citizen who has a right not<br/>
to be violated, but you're preaching to the choir here. Nobody said what<br/>
happened to you was right, just that it could have happened anywhere,<br/>
anytime, anyplace.  Everyone tried to give some suggestions on how to<br/>
prevent such things from happening in the future.  No harm there, I would<br/>
personally rather have experienced hikers tell me what precautions they<br/>
take, then to have one incident scare me from a location and a letterbox,<br/>
doing that is a large injustice to the placer, and future finders... if you<br/>
know what I mean.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lily, I could not agree more with Pandora's assessment of the <br/>
situation.  I understand that you are rattled right now, and you feel <br/>
violated.  That's understandable.  But, there really did seem to be <br/>
an undercurrent in your messages suggesting that Funhog is somehow <br/>
partially responsible for what happened to you because she should <br/>
have warned you of the possibility of a break-in.<br/>
<br/>
Just because the cops told you that break-ins had occurred there in <br/>
the past, doesn't mean Funhog was aware of this info.  Nor does it <br/>
neccessarily mean that you are at a greater risk at that trailhead <br/>
than anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
We feel for you, because most of us have had similar things happen to <br/>
us... but we also feel for Funhog, and feel the need to jump to her <br/>
defense.  That's why everyone is leaping onto this thread.<br/>
<br/>
We all try to place our boxes responsibly, but please don't point a <br/>
finger at us if you manage to get hurt, scared, or ripped-off in the <br/>
process of looking for them.  We should all take responsibility for <br/>
the risks we take.<br/>
<br/>
I work at a college where parking lot break-ins occur several times <br/>
every semester.  But I would never tell students that they shouldn't <br/>
attend college because of it.  Sure, it's nice if instructors want to <br/>
remind students of the possibility, but it's not their responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Any time you leave your car unattended in a public place, you are <br/>
taking a risk.  Any time you walk around by yourself in a secluded <br/>
area, you are taking a risk.  This should be obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Just to be on the safe side, maybe we should all put the following <br/>
notice at the end of our clues... Warning: The world is a dangerous <br/>
place!<br/>

Just to reiterate what Ryan said here about having your car broken into can<br/>
happen anywhere. I thought I would give you one of my own experiences. Quite<br/>
some time ago I was in downtown Portland with a friend of mine. We were<br/>
around the Pioneer Square area around lunch time. I drove a 1972 Chevy<br/>
stepside pick-up that was well  - lets say built - and a very nice truck. We<br/>
were right around the corner from where I had parked my car when I thought I<br/>
heard my truck alarm going off. I turned and ran back and check it - where<br/>
to my amazement a man had the hood up trying to disconnect the alarm. The<br/>
police and ambulance had to be called - because for some strange reason he<br/>
decided that me yelling at him to leave my truck alone was something he was<br/>
actually going to be offended over. I must have really rattled him or<br/>
something because it certainly looked like he fell and broke both his knee<br/>
caps. [smiles slightly] My point to this little story is that tribulations<br/>
can occur anywhere - even in middle of the day on a busy street. Everyone<br/>
should always be as careful as possible - but at the same time not overly<br/>
careful that they are not able to live their life to their up most<br/>
happiness. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well. <br/>

&gt; honestly, had I known this...I would have picked<br/>
&gt; public areas or areas where there are large public<br/>
&gt; parking lots....not dinky trail heads....like<br/>
&gt; yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Your car can be broken into anywhere--not just the dinky trail <br/>
heads.  I've seen cars that had been broken into in the parking lot <br/>
of an apartment complex in good neighborhoods.  It's like the Paisley <br/>
Orca said--if you own a car, eventually, someone, somewhere, is going <br/>
to want to break into it.  There are things you can do to help reduce <br/>
that risk including where you choose to park it, but in the end, <br/>
everything you can do may not be enough.<br/>

- Paisley.....no hard feelings on my part and I was<br/>
not deliberately pointing fingers at FunHog....how was<br/>
she to know that there were break-ins there?  Heck,<br/>
she's famous...was in TIME magazine...um...I digress. <br/>
Anyway, who's to say the break-in's happened to<br/>
LBers...probably not. The COPS knew, though, and hubby<br/>
said that if break-in's are COMMON in a particular<br/>
area it would be nice to know that....maybe a sign<br/>
posted or something by the city police.  Then again,<br/>
LOL, the SIGN would probably get stolen, eh? and show<br/>
up in someone's garage for decoration.<br/>

Hasn't anyone ever heard of Pier 1?<br/>
