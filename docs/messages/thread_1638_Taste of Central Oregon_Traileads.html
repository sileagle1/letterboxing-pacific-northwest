                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey All!<br>
<br>
John and I went out for a beautiful end-of-summer stroll in a beautiful<br>
city park.  We took the clues for Taste of Central Oregon with us and<br>
found this incredible letterbox placed by 4DToes.  I do believe we will<br>
have to get over the mountain to get more of the letterboxes placed by<br>
this artistically-inclined clan.  I just love John Fleshman's carving<br>
style!!!<br>
<br>
As for trailhead break-ins, it's really hit or miss and not necessarily<br>
the destiny of one particular spot.  <br>
<br>
We've never been broken into while letterboxing since we started back in<br>
2000.  However, John's Jeep was broken into at Lolo Pass in Zig Zag<br>
while we were off hiking.  And my entire truck was physically stolen<br>
right from the driveway of my apartment next to my neighbor's window in<br>
my "safe" Laurelhurst  neighborhood a few years after I first moved back<br>
to Portland.  It doesn't matter.  <br>
<br>
You can cry and be an alarmist and pout "Why me?" and what it will get<br>
you is tons of sympathy because then you find out what a common<br>
occurrence it is.  Everyone will come up to you and say, "Dang!  That's<br>
terrible!  When my car got broke into they took this and this and this"<br>
And "They screwed up the lock so bad I couldn't even open the trunk till<br>
I got it repaired when mine got vandalized" or "When it happened to me<br>
they busted out the window to the extent..." etc. etc. etc.  It is a<br>
complete affront and violation of your private space when your vehicle<br>
is busted into or stolen, but at the same time it's more a matter of<br>
when, not if it will happen to your vehicle.  If it hasn't happened to<br>
you so far, then count your blessings!  <br>
<br>
Another thing you may want to consider...at least you have a car that<br>
can be broken into.  Some people are not so well off and don't even have<br>
that much.  We should count ourselves lucky to have material goods and<br>
have our basic needs met, I think.  Just something to think about.<br>
There are lots who are way less fortunate.  The things that really count<br>
in life are the intangibles.  We shouldn't get too bent out of shape<br>
when money and things go fleeting out of our hands sometimes.  At least<br>
we had that money and those things at some point in our lives and if we<br>
really want to it to be, it can be replaced.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes I think we should concentrate on what we can give rather than<br>
what is taken from us.  It can give us a sense of humility, empathy, and<br>
an opportunity to be good and share with others.  It comes back to us in<br>
different ways and instead of our feeling sorry for ourselves over what<br>
we've lost, we can give ourselves a chance to be empowered and<br>
enlightened by the uplifting act of giving.  Giving can negate what's<br>
taken and replace a bad feeling with a good one.<br>

<br>
Your car can be broken into anywhere--not just the dinky trail <br>
heads.  I've seen cars that had been broken into in the parking lot <br>
of an apartment complex in good neighborhoods.  It's like the Paisley <br>
Orca said--if you own a car, eventually, someone, somewhere, is going <br>
to want to break into it.  There are things you can do to help reduce <br>
that risk including where you choose to park it, but in the end, <br>
everything you can do may not be enough.<br>
<br>
On the bright side, even as 'common' as break-ins are, they're still <br>
relatively uncommon.  I've parked at trailheads hundreds of times and <br>
my car has never been broken into, including the trailhead where your <br>
car was hit.<br>
<br>
Suggestions about not leaving valuables in plain view in a car isn't <br>
a condemnation against you, but rather a suggestion for how you and <br>
other on this board might reduce risk of break-ins in the future.  <br>
You're solution (i.e. Don't go!) may not be an acceptable solution <br>
for others on this board that still want to get the letterbox.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to pay the price of a break-in for many years of happy <br>
hiking on beautiful, wonderful trails.  =)  But I certainly try not <br>
to make my car or anything into too appealing to thieves, either....<br>

Lily,<br>
<br>
I think you will quickly find on letterboxing lists that things you least<br>
expect to cause a stir will cause a Stir. The other thing you will probably<br>
find is that being the type that just has to have the last word will<br>
probably get you no where fast. Not that you are, just an observation.  I<br>
don't think Paisly Orca meant any offense, in fact, having met her, I know<br>
she didn't she is a very kind hearted and soft spoken individual. <br>
<br>
At the end of the day Lily I think where you are sensing the argument from<br>
is that a lot of us on the list feel that asking the place to be accountable<br>
for your personal responsibility is a bit outlandish.  Things like this<br>
happen in life, they happen to everyone, when I lived in California I had my<br>
house broken into 5 times. <br>
<br>
I think the other point that people are trying to make that you are<br>
overlooking, is that regardless of what the officer on the scene may have<br>
told you... LOTS and LOTS of letter boxers have parked in the very same<br>
place that you did, got the very same box you got, and not had their car<br>
broken into.  So asking a placer to change their clues to include a warning<br>
because your car got broken into when 75 other people (that is a guess) had<br>
no problems there is statistically invalid. <br>
<br>
I agree with you absolutely that you are a free citizen who has a right not<br>
to be violated, but you're preaching to the choir here. Nobody said what<br>
happened to you was right, just that it could have happened anywhere,<br>
anytime, anyplace.  Everyone tried to give some suggestions on how to<br>
prevent such things from happening in the future.  No harm there, I would<br>
personally rather have experienced hikers tell me what precautions they<br>
take, then to have one incident scare me from a location and a letterbox,<br>
doing that is a large injustice to the placer, and future finders... if you<br>
know what I mean.<br>

violated.  That's understandable.  But, there really did seem to be <br>
an undercurrent in your messages suggesting that Funhog is somehow <br>
partially responsible for what happened to you because she should <br>
have warned you of the possibility of a break-in.<br>
<br>
Just because the cops told you that break-ins had occurred there in <br>
the past, doesn't mean Funhog was aware of this info.  Nor does it <br>
neccessarily mean that you are at a greater risk at that trailhead <br>
than anywhere else.<br>
<br>
We feel for you, because most of us have had similar things happen to <br>
us... but we also feel for Funhog, and feel the need to jump to her <br>
defense.  That's why everyone is leaping onto this thread.<br>
<br>
We all try to place our boxes responsibly, but please don't point a <br>
finger at us if you manage to get hurt, scared, or ripped-off in the <br>
process of looking for them.  We should all take responsibility for <br>
the risks we take.<br>
<br>
I work at a college where parking lot break-ins occur several times <br>
every semester.  But I would never tell students that they shouldn't <br>
attend college because of it.  Sure, it's nice if instructors want to <br>
remind students of the possibility, but it's not their responsibility.<br>
<br>
Any time you leave your car unattended in a public place, you are <br>
taking a risk.  Any time you walk around by yourself in a secluded <br>
area, you are taking a risk.  This should be obvious.<br>
<br>
Just to be on the safe side, maybe we should all put the following <br>
notice at the end of our clues... Warning: The world is a dangerous <br>
place!<br>

<br>
Just to reiterate what Ryan said here about having your car broken into can<br>
happen anywhere. I thought I would give you one of my own experiences. Quite<br>
some time ago I was in downtown Portland with a friend of mine. We were<br>
around the Pioneer Square area around lunch time. I drove a 1972 Chevy<br>
stepside pick-up that was well  - lets say built - and a very nice truck. We<br>
were right around the corner from where I had parked my car when I thought I<br>
heard my truck alarm going off. I turned and ran back and check it - where<br>
to my amazement a man had the hood up trying to disconnect the alarm. The<br>
police and ambulance had to be called - because for some strange reason he<br>
decided that me yelling at him to leave my truck alone was something he was<br>
actually going to be offended over. I must have really rattled him or<br>
something because it certainly looked like he fell and broke both his knee<br>
caps. [smiles slightly] My point to this little story is that tribulations<br>
can occur anywhere - even in middle of the day on a busy street. Everyone<br>
should always be as careful as possible - but at the same time not overly<br>
careful that they are not able to live their life to their up most<br>
happiness. <br>
<br>
I bid you all well. <br>

Your car can be broken into anywhere--not just the dinky trail <br>
heads.  I've seen cars that had been broken into in the parking lot <br>
of an apartment complex in good neighborhoods.  It's like the Paisley <br>
Orca said--if you own a car, eventually, someone, somewhere, is going <br>
to want to break into it.  There are things you can do to help reduce <br>
that risk including where you choose to park it, but in the end, <br>
everything you can do may not be enough.<br>

- Paisley.....no hard feelings on my part and I was<br>
not deliberately pointing fingers at FunHog....how was<br>
she to know that there were break-ins there?  Heck,<br>
she's famous...was in TIME magazine...um...I digress. <br>
Anyway, who's to say the break-in's happened to<br>
LBers...probably not. The COPS knew, though, and hubby<br>
said that if break-in's are COMMON in a particular<br>
area it would be nice to know that....maybe a sign<br>
posted or something by the city police.  Then again,<br>
LOL, the SIGN would probably get stolen, eh? and show<br>
up in someone's garage for decoration.<br>

Hasn't anyone ever heard of Pier 1?<br>
