Ok don't ask me why, it is really early for me to be getting creative<br>
but I tried!!!!  I cannot draw like my brother, but I added an idea I<br>
had..........something other than a round shape!!!  Please keep in<br>

 ====================<br>
<br>
I like that you incorporated a mountain and water, but especially like the<br>
raindrop shape!  (I've heard you're getting a lot of rain lately...)<br>
<br>
Sometime within the last week or so, someone mentioned the blackberry vines<br>
in one of the posts about images for a patch design.   I know they are very<br>
invasive and definitely viciously SCRATCHY, but I must admit that Martini<br>
Man and I were in 7th Heaven stuffing our faces with those sweet juicy<br>
berries last August - YUM!  We couldn't believe how many there were and that<br>
someone hadn't already beat us to them all.  Those things sell for a fortune<br>
around here, but you had them all over the place just for the picking.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to ordering one of the PNW patches after a design is<br>
selected.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So many awesome ideas for a patch, so far!!!  It's exciting to see <br>
these.  Akin to having multiple folks bring event stamps to a <br>
gathering.  I attended a gathering 2 years ago and 6 folks brought <br>
event stamps--they were all modifications on a theme & they were all <br>
awesome & unique in their own ways!  I'll treasure them forever!!!<br>
<br>
I just posted my proposal but it needs modifications that I'm unable to <br>
apply given my software on hand here at home.  I couldn't figure the <br>
exact font to use for the "N".  I also don't have a powerful enough <br>
graphic program to insert the mountain between the orca's flippers <br>
instead of on top of them.  I'd also eliminate the black, rectangular <br>
border around the orca and confine the outline to an oval that snugly <br>
hugs the orca--possibly inserting the orange 'fill' in that area like <br>
the LBNA patch.  I really like the concept that ties the regional <br>
patches to the main organization yet still allows enough modification <br>
to add a regional touch to it.  I was also trying to figure out a way <br>
to insert an evergreen tree--since it's so representative of this <br>
region.  Couldn't find an image that was strong & bold enough for it <br>
yet wouldn't add distraction or busy-ness to it.  Prolly the simpler <br>
the better when it comes to a patch.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it's very cool that folks are sharing ideas. Just like you, I<br>
hope Maiden doesn't mind my interpretation of her concept. Since the<br>
Northwest is also known for it's contributions to the art of<br>
calligraphy, I wanted to use a lettering style that would reflect<br>
that. On top of all that, I am beyond excited by the new skills I've<br>
gained taking an online Photoshop class at PCC and this was a perfect<br>
way to show some of them off.<br>
<br>
So far, the additions to the album are all wonderful. I know we'll end<br>
up with something really nice as a result. I've already had three out<br>
of state people tell me they want one when we get them! <br>
<br>
One more detail about production. I've learned that you can use up to<br>
seven colors without an increase in price. Funhog<br>

I sure hope you do get to see your orcas before you go, and for real,<br>

They're tasty, but if I were you I wouldn't attempt transplanting our<br>
blackberries home with you. ;) The most pernicious ones we've got (and<br>
therefore, the most plentiful) are actually what're called Himalayan<br>
blackberries- they're not native and they're *very* invasive... which you<br>
could no doubt see!<br>
<br>
Ah, well, at least they're good to eat. Unlike some other non-native,<br>
invasive plants. (Scotch broom, ugh!)<br>
