Der Mad Stamper's Spirit of Dartmoor is a classic. Delightfully fun to<br/>
work on, delightfully fun to get, and not only is it in the Spirit of<br/>
Dartmoor, but is also the inspiration of the Pacific Northwest. That's<br/>
what first got me started with multi-color stamps which, at the time<br/>
was so new to everyone, that I created the "Stamping with Style"<br/>
tutorial. I used to link to it from the stamps I planted where I<br/>
recommended using multiple colors, though now it no longer seems<br/>
necessary since everyone does multi-colored stamps.<br/>

Troutdale! Although you might need an umbrella to get the box, it is<br/>
not a terribly long walk and you can bring it back to your car for<br/>
stamping. The two times I've been there, that's just what we did. The<br/>
process can get pretty involved as the number of stamps grows and grows.<br/>
<br/>
I think this box is one of the cleverest innovations to hit the scene.<br/>
Since its debut, there have been a couple of other versions created<br/>
using a similar concept but this is the grand daddy. I look forward to<br/>
another visit soon to see what new tools have been added to the<br/>
collection.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Spirit of Dartmoor, get crackin' on that one if you haven't<br/>
solved it yet. Trust me, it will come in handy at a later date... Funhog <br/>

your own judgement on that - but I would be more interested to find<br/>
out if someone else finds the box, as I don't think it's there.  I<br/>
found what I think was its location, confirmed by someone else when I<br/>

Yellow Rose of Suffrage has extensive clues that can be solved<br/>
indoors, and without saying more I think it would be an appropriate<br/>
box for inclement weather - when you've solved the clues you can use<br/>
your own judgement on that - but I would be more interested to find<br/>
out if someone else finds the box, as I don't think it's there.  I<br/>
found what I think was its location, confirmed by someone else when I<br/>
got back home, but there were only beer cans around, no box.  I was<br/>
there Nov. 26.<br/>

usually in Montana at Christmas, but decided not to go this year.  So we <br/>
spent Christmas Eve boxing in Tacoma and visiting the Glass Museum (no, no, <br/>
nooo, Team Catnip, the gift was OURS).  We spent Boxing Day letterboxing in <br/>
Everett and Bothell, and took in Narnia while we were at it.  Quite idyllic. <br/>
We will spend New Year's Eve boxing Bellevue/Mercer Island.  That should <br/>
keep us busy.  :-)<br/>

style, and we worry about colors and lettering after the final vote is <br/>
chosen (whether the background is blue or green, whether we abbreviate or <br/>
not).  The basic idea is there, and the rest is fine-tuning.  So for this <br/>
reason, if there is a run-off, I think one is fine.  It can be fine-tuned, <br/>
IF my design was the favorite (what an honor).  Personally, I think <br/>
dvn2rckr's Arts and Crafts one ROCKS.<br/>

And may I just say how cool it was for Funhog to start the whole discussion <br/>
anyway.<br/>

And for my part, I like LbPNW.  Why broadcast what we're doing by spelling <br/>
it out to the Dursleys.<br/>

  The most unusual thing I have come across were the vision quest caves <br/>
  at Ruckel Creek.  I didn't know what they were at the time, but it was <br/>
  obvious that they were man-made so I knew they must have had some <br/>
  reason to exist.  Sullivans mentions them and says that they are  <br/>
  possibly around 1000 years old, ancient Indian vision quest caves.  I <br/>
  found very little when I tried to internet-research them.<br/>

  No no no! Don't say things like that. That's mean and horrible. Now I'll be<br/>
  forced to attempt those boxes and when i die of of a heart attack half way<br/>
  up it will be all your fault :) <br/>
<br/>
  Actually that's incredibly cool and I am going to have to try them now. <br/>

  Let's see, most unusual thing I've come across while boxing. Ummm, I can't<br/>
  really think of anything good other than the black plastic sack of porn<br/>

The pattern was in a sampler style --  do you know what a sampler is?  <br/>
(A bit of European/American history here).  Now you know the <br/>
inspiration behind the 18 boxes.  At the time I didn't think about <br/>
doing a box for each of numbers 0-9.  That woulda been 28 boxes, yikes.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, yes, gas prices are definitely affecting my F-count.  I was <br/>
planning on taking my dogs racing over the weekend, one race meet in <br/>
Beavercreek and one in Mollala and had planned to pick up at least <br/>
four boxes on the way.  After applying advanced calculus formulas to <br/>
mileage, gas prices, and dog food, I figured out it would cost me <br/>
over $100 to race my dogs this weekend and pick up letterboxes.  I <br/>
decided to be good and stay home and do laundry instead. Which <br/>
wasn't nearly as much fun, let me tell you.<br/>

While I may not go far from home because of gas prices, I have been <br/>
picking up the occasional box near home or work.  I did go pick up <br/>
an AMAZING stamp that was close to my work the other day.  If you <br/>
haven't yet solved the Seasonal Anagram box and gotten the bonus <br/>
box, you really need to put it on your list.  It is a beautiful <br/>
stamp and well worth the effort of finding it!!  Come on all you NW <br/>
letterboxers!  That series has been out for over a year now and I <br/>
was the first one to sign in.  Trust me; you MUST have this stamp in <br/>
your book.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is old news but probably unknown to our West-side friends.  Last year<br/>
Wood-aug &amp; I started a series called "Just a Bike Ride" (JABR) that is in<br/>
eastern WA and OR.  It's about how we met each other 20 years ago while on a<br/>
multi-day bicycle tour.  I won't divulge any more details.  Last year we<br/>
placed 3 boxes in various towns and have plans for probably 5(?) more.<br/>
Overall we placed 9 boxes during that east side trip and had a great time<br/>
doing it. There were so few boxes out there - they add oasis' for Lbers<br/>
making a trip across the desert.   It's kind of strange since we haven't<br/>
placed that many boxes on the west side where we live!   We are considering<br/>
going back this summer and doing more . . . we'll see.  The JABR series will<br/>
be much more filled out once we get done.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, this series has special meaning for us.  Not sure how interesting<br/>
it is to others.<br/>

Just kidding....<br/>
<br/>
How about.... what's the longest hike someone has done to get a<br/>
letterbox? (I figure I have to throw in at least one half-decent<br/>
question to cover my half-not-so-decent question. *nodding*)<br/>

letterboxes around various high adventure spots.  My first one is the "Big<br/>
Kahuna" outside of a whitewater rafting spot with the same name.  I plan on<br/>
a rock climbing box coming soon.  I'm not sure what the others will be.  We<br/>
shall see.  Originally it was just going to be one box, but then when I<br/>
thought of planting overlooking Big Kahuna, I realized that Kahuna was too<br/>
good of a name to just let go, so now it will be a series and keep the<br/>
Darwin awards feel of "natural selection."  I like the idea of paying<br/>
tribute to various activities in my region while having a little fun.<br/>
<br/>
I've also enjoyed planting some around that were dedicated to local ghost<br/>
towns.  There are plenty of old mining towns in this region.  I think they<br/>
are fascinating and you don't see them on overy map, so I like to take<br/>
people out to them.  I love letterboxes with a little history.<br/>

<br/>
I know Ryan's experience at Paradise Lodge in SW OR far exceeds these <br/>
but it's a toss up between a 7-miler along the AT in New York hunting <br/>
out a Pete &amp; Wanda box or a similar distance box we sought out on the <br/>
Olympic Peninsula several years back (we made it longer than it needed <br/>
to be).<br/>
<br/>
Now, if we strung a bunch of finds together in one day I think our <br/>
longest day (with kids in tow) would be about 13 miles.  Without the <br/>
kids it'd be much longer as pre-kids we used to do longer outings quite <br/>
regularly but I haven't had the luxury to box without the kids yet as <br/>
I'm too frugal to hire a babysitter.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps another interesting TOTW might be what's the longest drive <br/>
you've done just to get a letterbox?  I think Pandora &amp; Iron Bear's <br/>
quest for a Lemony Snicket classic a few years ago might win this one <br/>
hands down.  ;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure about hikes, but my longest letterboxing adventure was actually<br/>
by boat.  I spent five days whitewater rafting on the Middle Fork of the<br/>
Salmon in Central Idaho and left a letterbox halfway through that.  I think<br/>
you can get there by hiking (for a really, really, really long time), but<br/>
there are no roads in at all to it.  I suspect that box is going to sit<br/>
lonely for a long, long time.<br/>
<br/>
As for hiking, 8-9 miles is probably the furthest I've gone on purpose.  As<br/>
for how long I've spent hiking/wandering around searching for a box I<br/>
couldn't find--heaven only knows.  I remember a certain box of Ryan's in<br/>
this area that I read way to much into the clue and unfortunately some<br/>
markers in the trail backed it up.  Every time I decided that there was no<br/>
way he meant that, I would find something else that seemed to fit into the<br/>
clue.  It was a bizarre set of coincidences that left me tromping all over<br/>
the place.  (Isn't it funny how your mind can twist things to fit a clue<br/>
sometimes?)<br/>
<br/>
My favorite moment came when I was standing at the end of a long trail.  I<br/>
looked like any hiker, I thought, I was standing there with my pack on<br/>
looking at a printout of a clue.  I was miles off course.  A van pulled up,<br/>
and I assumed they were just curious about the trail I had obviously just<br/>
hiked.  I about fell over when the guy stuck his head out and asked, "excuse<br/>
me, but are you a letterboxer?"  Keep in mind, there aren't really other<br/>
letterboxers in my area at all.  I have NEVER had a run in on the trail!  I<br/>
about fell over.  When I asked how in the world he knew to ask me that, he<br/>
(AZRoadie) said "because yesterday I combed this whole mountain and found<br/>
myself standing in the exact same spot you are at now, looking at a clue<br/>
with the exact same confused look on my face!"  I was laughing so hard!  We<br/>
spent the rest of the afternoon searching together.  We were pretty<br/>
embarrassed when we realized that we had put way too much into the clue and<br/>
had gone right past it before.  Boy, did we ever literally do happy dances<br/>
when we finally did find the box!<br/>

Last summer I placed 2 boxes at Tunnel Falls in the Gorge, which is <br/>
12-13 miles, depending on where you park.  (If you do this hike, or <br/>
other Eagle Creek area trails, park at the first lot on the left <br/>
near the camp host, not the lot further in at the trailhead.  There <br/>
are often break-ins at that one).  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, probably the thing that most dissuades me from some boxes is if the <br/>
location is just too much of a bushwhack.  We were once on a trail where a <br/>
letterbox was planted off-trail, steeply uphill, in fallen timber and <br/>
plants, in an area posted prominently that trails had been extensively <br/>
damaged by cutting-off trails, and there was a fine if you were caught doing <br/>
it.  We decided to leave that one lie - not because of the fine, but because <br/>
I have a daughter that I want to learn respect for the parks, and I'd not <br/>
like her to think it's acceptable to trample the vegetation and make a <br/>
social trail for a letterbox, even if we hiked 10 miles to get there.<br/>
<br/>
We also looked for another that I think wasn't an off-trail bushwhack when <br/>
it was planted, but certainly is now, so we left it alone and enjoyed the <br/>
location instead.<br/>
<br/>
I've done several where I get to the locale, and the box is obviously in the <br/>
middle of a thicket of undergrowth.  No way I'd do that.<br/>
<br/>
I can be a bit of a klutz, so I tend to avoid ones that are red-flagged as <br/>
"don't take your children this is down a steep hill, on the edge of a bluff, <br/>
and you have to hang upside-down in a bat cave to get it."<br/>
<br/>
Long hikes don't dissuade me, but high-elevation-gain hikes do, because I'm <br/>
simply not fit enough to attempt them yet.  But they're on my list for when <br/>
I am!  Then, maybe I'll see some more Green Tortugas!<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents,<br/>

the best, mostly because of the beautiful walks we have discovered thanks to <br/>

&gt; I have only found a couple of dvn2rckr boxes so can't really say I<br/>
&gt; have a favorite yet.  What impressed me the most is the first year I<br/>
&gt; was letterboxing I saw their stamps in almost every box I found.  I<br/>
&gt; was totally amazed that anyone could cover so much territory and log<br/>
&gt; into so many boxes.  I'm glad I had the honor of finally meeting<br/>
&gt; Bethany and her family at the Stargazers gathering, wish them the best<br/>
&gt; in all of their adventures and will be looking forward to finding<br/>
&gt; their boxes for years to come.   H-A-F<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "What is your favorite dvn2rckr box?  They're all over the place, so<br/>
&gt; I'm sure most of us have found at least one or two!"<br/>

Has anyone ever letterboxed while out horseback riding? Just <br/>
wondering...<br/>
If not then how many of us have biked to boxes (road vs. mountain <br/>
bikes)?<br/>
<br/>
I have biked to a few and am planning to plant many more with our Rail <br/>
Trail series that my daughter and I have started in the Spokane area.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, GG and Wildhair for the patch designs. I'm inclined to go<br/>
ahead with Wildhair's patch, because it is a simplified version of<br/>
Funhog's design which includes the traditional lettering and it was<br/>
voted a favorite. Also, if you've already bought patches, it's nice to<br/>
have some continuity with the shirts. Is Wildhair's modified patch<br/>
okay with you, Funhog?<br/>
<br/>
I think we will ditch the lime green and orange, and print the logo in<br/>
black or brown. The slogan ("wander") will be on the back, also black<br/>
or brown, probably in a casual handwriting font if I can use one. I'm<br/>
thinking of white long-sleeve shirts for the first order. I may try to<br/>
dye some of them and see what kind of result I can get. Or we can<br/>
order colored shirts in the future.<br/>
<br/>
This should keep our costs well under $20, which is definitely a cap<br/>
for me too. You can't please all of the people all of the time, but I<br/>
think we've come to a good consensus. I'm going to start comparing<br/>
printers. Any more ideas before I run with it?<br/>

Oh my goodness, I'm sorry for mentioning a poll - looks like things<br/>
are already decided on and ready to go - all the better!  I don't post<br/>
or read things at AtlasQuest and don't have time to read here all the<br/>
time either, so sorry I missed all of that.  No poll, forget I said that.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am fine with Wild Hair's version of the patch. I am also glad you are <br/>
planning to choose a rounded font rather than block letters. However, I <br/>
alway think black printing on a white t-shirt looks cheap. Plus, it <br/>
would get dirty really fast. At least it would if I were wearing it. <br/>
Pigs are sloppy as you probably know. I would prefer a darker color <br/>
like brown or burgundy with green lettering. The color green need not <br/>
be the limey one on the patch.<br/>
<br/>
A bit of history for those who may be new here: The orange and green <br/>
were chosen to coordinate with the LbNA patch and the other regional <br/>
patches that have used the same color combo. In truth, it turns out tha <br/>
the original patches were meant to have a white background but the <br/>
embroidery place made a mistake. Voila! Orange and green became <br/>
the "official" colors. <br/>
<br/>
As for the slug carrying a purse (???) the slug has an umbrella (as it <br/>
is labeled in my image catalogue) in one hand and the other hand holds <br/>
a rubber stamp. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, go for it... the plan sounds good. Funhog<br/>
