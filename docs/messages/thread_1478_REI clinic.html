                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay I understand a bit more now -- and I totally agree with what is being<br>
said here -- I don't think REI would go out and hire anyone to specifically<br>
host these clinics -- but would pick the most qualified employee to do them.<br>
<br>
As for the logbook thing I agree making logs books is cheaper and quite<br>
honestly a lot of fun, however I think we also have to look from the other<br>
perspective, not everyone has the time to hand make logbooks for all their<br>
letterboxes.  I agree that lined pages sort of suck for stamping images, but<br>
given that it took me hours and hours to make the logbooks for Iron Bear's<br>
Trail with Tears series I can understand why we don't see these as the norm<br>
in most boxes.  -- I'm with Amanda that there are a lot of things that add<br>
to the lure of a letterbox - I personally find boxes more enjoyable that<br>
have stories to them that teach me something, like Ryan's Walking Tour<br>
taught me some wonderful history of Portland.  -- I like when the stamp and<br>
location mesh together, but overall, I think we need to realize that when<br>
someone places a letterbox, it is for their enjoyment as well as ours, and<br>
that it can't always be the way we think it should be.  I don't think we<br>
should be disappointed over things like log books, and whether or not the<br>
image matches the surroundings any more that we should be disappointed that<br>
we are not the first ones to find it.<br>
