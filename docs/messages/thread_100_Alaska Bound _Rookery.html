when you sent the post? I was out checking on several of my WA boxes<br/>
this afternoon and Alaska Bound was one of them. I hadn't been there<br/>
since I first placed it. The box is slated to head north in mid-June<br/>
in the care of YeeHaw YaYa. Those who haven't put this stamp into<br/>
their logbooks yet need to head out in the next few weeks. This one is<br/>
a must-have, in my opinion. She's a beauty...<br/>
<br/>
I also checked on the Rookery since Maronie and the Gimpy Orca<br/>
(ouch!!!) failed to find it last weekend. I managed to get wet and<br/>
muddy from ankle to thigh and befriend a bunch of bovines in the<br/>
process. I also found the box, under a layer of dirt and sans<br/>
visitors. It could be that the compass heading in the clue is dead<br/>
wrong. Any future searchers should try 35 degrees not 45.<br/>
<br/>
Everything else I looked for was in good shape. I also managed to come<br/>
home with two (!) unexpected stamps in my journal, a HH and a bonus<br/>
clue  that had magically appeared in one the boxes I visited. I was in<br/>
(where else?) Hog Heaven... Funhog<br/>
