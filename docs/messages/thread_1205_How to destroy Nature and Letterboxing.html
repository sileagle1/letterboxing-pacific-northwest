I went Letterboxing at Point Defiance Parka couple of weekends ago. Due to circumstances at home I haven't boxed much in the last year so I was interested to see what these interlopers (grin) had left in 'my' park (bigger grin). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the most part I was a bit disappointed in what I found. Stamps were great, some good clues. Problem is many of boxes were hidden off the trail in the wilds.  One clue included a great lesson on nurse stumps and how they are a habitat for new growth. Very nice. Ironically the clue goes on to say "If you look in the middle of it you will find a delicate "Trillium" hidden there." I must add if you look closely you will notice all the delicate new flora and fauna around this nurse stump where this stamp is hidden has been trampled to death. All gone, dead. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is just one example and I am not trying to point a finger just at this individual. There are many more like this and I am one of the offenders too. Last year I moved my very first box for just this reason. It was way off the trail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think Letterboxers need to think twice before leaving the trail to plant a box. If we continue to invade the off trail areas it is only a matter of time before an official type gets bent and comes after us. We have seen it happen in the National Parks and if we aren't careful State City and County Parks will soon not welcome us. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Glenn and all Letterboxers,<br/>
I agree with Glenn...letterboxing should be a low-impact activity,<br/>
especially in natural areas in and around urban areas.  These areas<br/>
are already under stress due to the encroachment of nonnative plants<br/>
and animals, and suburbia crowding in.  Adding the insult of trampled<br/>
vegetation to such injury won't do anything to promote the fun<br/>
activity of Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I monitor letterboxes in the Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation<br/>
District with an eye toward 1) the safety of letterboxers and 2) the<br/>
impacts to the natural areas.  I have yet to encounter resistance from<br/>
the Letterboxing community to a suggestion to move a box to a safer or<br/>
less-impacted location.  Those letterboxers with whom I've talked have<br/>
been very willing to work with me to find a good location for a box. <br/>
Such cooperation is key to continuation of this activity as great,<br/>
outdoor, family-oriented entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest that if you see an area around a letterbox is getting 'loved<br/>
to death', then contact the person that placed the box. By such active<br/>
involvement, we can all avoid the scenario where the box is<br/>
arbitrarily removed by a park manager that doesn't understand the<br/>
activity or the fun of Letterboxing, but is concerned about the<br/>
environment they steward.<br/>
