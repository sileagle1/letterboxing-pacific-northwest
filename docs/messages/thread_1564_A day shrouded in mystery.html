<br>
As Der Mad Stamper alluded to already today - the Passport to Letterboxing<br>
event had is fair share of surprises. One of those surprises being some very<br>
interesting and romantic notes in a few boxes that were already established<br>
on websites before the event.  Upon returning home Sunday pandora and I got<br>
an itching for mystery clues because this note in particular was truly<br>
something to behold. Therefore we decided to crunch down and work out a list<br>
of mystery boxes and set out on a journey today. However we had no idea<br>
where that journey would take us. I am happy to report that Funhogs Ace of<br>
Fun is alive and well. Also Maidens Horsin around Clackamas box -though not<br>
a mystery box - is alive and well though the logbook needs a little TLC.<br>
Unfortunately what we experienced before that was something most unexpected.<br>
The mysterious Cloakedletterboxer provided us with a wonderful journey -<br>
shrouded in mystery and romance of a day long past it seems. So upon finding<br>
the first box it become overly apparent that our journey into the<br>
Cloakedletterboxers world is far from over so we spent most of the day doing<br>
our best to help her find her long lost love. We returned home jubilant and<br>
yet sorrowful. There is no question that we long to return to her next<br>
mystery very soon. <br>
<br>
If you have not attempted any mystery boxes I certainly encourage you to do<br>
so - it is one of the more enjoyable aspects of this Hobby. <br>
<br>
I bid you all well. <br>

Iron`Bear is so right -- today was absolutely hands down one of my best<br>
letterboxing experiences.  We failed to find a couple boxes we looked for<br>
... the Mysterious Tim's Prize is still mystifying us and the first question<br>
to SP has me perplexed -- however, after stumbling across the solution to<br>
the Clue we discovered this weekend at Camp Stamp and finding the first of<br>
the CloakedLetterboxer's boxes I can honestly say that after a very<br>
stressful month of planning for Stamp Camp - with no time at all to<br>
Letterbox, I am once again drawn into the love of this game by someone who<br>
is superior at playing it.  My Hats off once more to these mysterious<br>
letterboxers such as Lemony Snicket, Miller and Hutch and the<br>
CloakedLetterboxer -- whoever you are, you make this game a joy to<br>
participate in. Every time I watch Spiderman I think of you guys.<br>
