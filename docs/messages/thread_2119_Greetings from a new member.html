                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all, I just want to introduce myself, a relatively new<br>
letterboxer.  I'm 55, married to someone who can't walk much, but we<br>
run a medical word processing business together, so LBing is perfect<br>
for me when I want to get out and about on the weekends or after work,<br>
even when we are camping or otherwise away from home.  Being together<br>
is great, but neither of us minds when we go off alone since we are<br>
together so much during the day.  I'm pretty involved in my work and a<br>
message board that is associated with that, but I want to spend some<br>
time looking for boxes and watching this board for the feel of the<br>
community.  My interests are gardening, bicycling, RV camping,<br>
calligraphy, and Kewpie dolls.  You'll see a calligraphy K as my stamp<br>
when I visit your books.  We will be first-time grandparents in August<br>
to a grandson from our son and his wife, who live in Terrebonne,<br>
Oregon, near Redmond.  I have only found a few boxes but had the fun<br>
of looking one up in New York in 2004 and a couple in Eastern Oregon<br>
as well as a few here nearer my home.  I hope to have my first box,<br>
The Lonely Juniper, placed in the next week or so, am working on a few<br>
details.  I need to spend some time reading the FAQs and such; I<br>
already missed out on taking a hitchhiker stamp with me because I<br>
didn't realize what it was but will know what to do next time.  I'm<br>
sure there are some etiquette type things I should be aware of as<br>
well.  We will be at Cape Lookout State Park over the coming holiday<br>
and hope to check out some boxes near there, any suggestions will be<br>
welcome.  I know that many of you will be at Silver Falls  a<br>
beautiful place to spend some time with friends.  I bought stamps for<br>
my first box, but I carved my personal stamp and am looking forward to<br>
fixing up more boxes to place as I have time and would like to carve<br>
the stamps for them as well.  You seem to be a nice bunch of people,<br>
and perhaps I will meet one or more of you someday.  I look forward to<br>
at least enjoying the outdoors in this new and unique way as much as I<br>
can.  I actually thought I saw some letterboxers on a trail at Oxbow <br>
I was seated a ways off fooling with the stamps and box I had just<br>
found when I saw these people at a crucial intersection looking at a<br>
paper with their heads together.  Turns out they were just looking at<br>
a map, but they were quite interested in what I was doing.  I think I<br>
told them enough but not too much, certainly not where I found what I<br>
was looking at!  I've learned to take gloves along for sticker bushes<br>
and a stick for poking about in the leaves and dirt  so far it has<br>
been nothing but fun.  Thank-you funhog and maiden for the kind<br>
communications I've had with you, most likely will be more of that<br>
considering how active you both are in this hobby.  Enjoy your<br>
weekend, wherever you may find yourself.  Cheers from Kathy.<br>
