their find if they wanted.  I did that today, although the box is at<br>
my house waiting for me to get time to place it where I want to. <br>
Also, went out boxing with my dog yesterday and placed a couple of<br>
boxes along the way.  I found Edible Forest Huckleberry and<br>
Salmonberry, darling stamps that look really nice if you have them<br>
next to one another in your book, Pioneer Conestoga, and Road 39: "The<br>
Meadow" by a letterboxer new to our community.  Cozmo was not there,<br>
but I had checked ahead of time on its status, and the placer says she<br>
plans to replace it.  Ran out of gas (me that is, not my truck) before<br>
I got to the Trillium Lake area - next time!  I was trying to work my<br>
way up the slope of Mt. Hood staying ahead of the heat as the day went<br>
on but it didn't work very well and the hike up to Mirror Lake almost<br>
did me in.  Boy did I wish I had a swimsuit and towel along! <br>
