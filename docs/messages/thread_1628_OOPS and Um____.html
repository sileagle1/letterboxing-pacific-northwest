                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, since my glasses have done a grave disservice to<br>
me this evening and I just emailed a private email to<br>
my friend and fellow LBer Pandora - I now have the<br>
privledge  of sharing with my fellow LBers on this<br>
board why I wrote to her what I did.  (Nice job<br>
LILY....)<br>
<br>
Anyway, Pandora and I had a disagreement about an<br>
issue and we both vented what we thought.  She made<br>
some very valid points but I chose not to listen to<br>
her because I had a point to make and wasn't going to<br>
let it go until I made it.  I don't believe we went<br>
into "fighting" but we made our feelings known and in<br>
the process I discounted Pandora's experience and<br>
advice in lieu of making my point.<br>
<br>
I was wrong and my behavior was unacceptable.<br>
<br>
So I wrote an apology to her - which was to be private<br>
but you know me....breakin' all the rules right off<br>
the bat to get them out of the way.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it was brought to my attention that I have<br>
managed to irritate a few others in a general sense. <br>
No specifics or names were mentioned but words of<br>
advice from those in the know is something to listen<br>
to. So, I'll use this email to apologize collectively,<br>
to whomever you are that I have managed to upset.  It<br>
was never my intent to be this annoying, salt in the<br>
wound, person....thought I've done a bang up job of<br>
it.  Since many of you last spoke with me in person -<br>
a bit under a month ago, we have had a shocker hit one<br>
of my family members and so things have been very on<br>
edge here.  I've tried to conduct business as usual<br>
but it appears that the stress and frustration of the<br>
situation has infiltrated much of what I've had to say<br>
and in turn has affected many of you.<br>
<br>
So, please accept his public apology for my behavior,<br>
rudeness, and discounting of any of ya'lls experience,<br>
advice, and words of wisdom.  It was never<br>
intentional.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned to Pandora, publicly (Do I need to be<br>
beat with a wet noodle????) we are wrapping up our<br>
public LBing this week.  We've got a Girl Scouts<br>
series in the works for TeaTat95's group....but that's<br>
it.  I will use the expert advice I've been given from<br>
ya'll as I share this wonderful hobby with a group of<br>
girls who will use their scouting skills in<br>
conjunction with an awesome hobby.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, this is long and boring, I am sure, but none<br>
the less it's from the bottom of my heart.  I'd hate<br>
to lose ya'll as fellow trail dusters because of my<br>
childish actions.  I'd be losing out.<br>
<br>
I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive this<br>
newby LBer who remains clueless on many things but<br>
very excited about a hobby which has really become<br>
quite a passion.<br>
<br>
SMILES to each of you!<br>
<br>
LILY<br>
