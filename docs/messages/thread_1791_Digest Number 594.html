Re "Boxes way over there"<br>
We know what that is like and you are right - when Canada Goose moved to<br>
Spokane there were very few boxes to find. Much like here in the Fraser<br>
Valley ( Vancouver Canada ) Area when we, the Secret Gardeners, began<br>
LBoxing some years ago. Now our boxes here are visited regularly and there<br>
are a bunch more planted by CSB and Zara for us to find.<br>
However, soon we are off to a new territory, an island actually,  where<br>
there lies no letterboxes at all. So, we've packed our tote with<br>
suppies..... bits of rubber, plastic containers, note books and zip lock<br>
bags in preparation of once again hiding our own boxes till other people<br>
catch on! Watch for new boxes in the spring 2005 in paradise AKA Barbados.<br>
The Secret Garden and the Gardeners are moving there for 5 years.<br>
Wishing everyone a safe and happy holiday season and save hunting.<br>
Jane and Chris<br>
