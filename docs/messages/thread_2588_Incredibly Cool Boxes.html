                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our family left for a road trip on Sunday. We have had an amazing trip. We<br/>
boxed our way down 101, finding many fabulous boxes. (Thank you Carie, Don<br/>
and Gwen, Ryan, South Hill Hendersons, and Legerdermain) Each one just<br/>
happened to be right where we needed to stretch our legs. There were two<br/>
that eluded us, but Im not sure one of them was there. We ended our 101 run<br/>
at the Rogue River. We went up the Rogue on the Jet boats. If you ever get<br/>
the chance to do that, DO IT, its amazing. We didnt get to go as far up as<br/>
Don and Gwens boxes, but I did leave one for you at our end point. (Clue<br/>
coming soon to a web site near you).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then we went across to the Oregon Caves. That is truly an amazing tour. We<br/>
toured the Caves and then went after Erfellies Baby Big Foot. That poor box<br/>
has been there over a year now with only one visitor (last week). Its an<br/>
amazing box my friends. One of my all time favorites! If youre driving<br/>
through that area, STOP and get this box. You will kick yourself for not<br/>
having done it sooner.  <br/>

I'll be there this coming week and was planning on looking for this<br/>
box, unfortunately, just now when I went to print the clue... there's<br/>
no clue there!  I'm not getting the error message that I get from the<br/>
LbNA site... anyone know what's going on?  Anyone have the clues they<br/>
can share? (before tomorrow noon-ish if possible...that's when we're<br/>
heading out from Portland to Shasta in a straight shot and then slowly<br/>
back up to be home by next weekend... so fun!!)<br/>
