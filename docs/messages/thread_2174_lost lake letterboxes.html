                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am sure you will get quite a few responses to this post.  It sounds <br/>
like someone has placed a letterbox in the vacinity of a Goecache and <br/>
the Cachers have found it and begun to us it as such.  Unfortunately, <br/>
they take something and leave something, this is why you found items <br/>
in the box.  They probably took the stamp not knowing what a <br/>
letterbox was.  The best thing you can do is try to contact the <br/>
placer, and leave it alone really.  It is always nice to see people <br/>
helping to maintain our boxes, but if the placer has abandoned it, <br/>
there's not a whole lot you can do.   <br/>
<br/>
As far as your clues, I would highly suggest that you make them a <br/>
seperate entity from this box.  Write them how you like including <br/>
directions and publish them.  I try to never give information in my <br/>
clues for other's boxes, I have had people freak out on me about it.  <br/>
It seems that many others don't like any references to their boxes, <br/>
especially if they went to great lengths to not add directions or <br/>
make them not easy to find.  I suppose it comes down to a "live and <br/>
let live attitude"  I have tried to help ppl only to get screamed at <br/>
for it, so I have found it best to take care of my boxes and leave <br/>
others to their owners.  We all have different ideas of how to place <br/>
and write clues for our boxes, which gives us infintie choices to <br/>
hunt for, so I guess, I just choose to respect the way someone else <br/>
does it and not go changing anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Please don't think I am telling you what to do, or that this is <br/>
written harshly, it is so hard to tell in emails!  I am just bouncing <br/>
some ideas off for you, 'casue you asked.....  There are a whole <br/>
bunch of new boxers out there now, we love to see them, it means more <br/>
boxes!  But there is a huge trend happening that I see; people trying <br/>
to take on caring for everything.  It really does suck when you go <br/>
out and find a box that is not maintained, missing, or Geocached.  <br/>
But I guess in the end, my opinion is it's not yours to fix or <br/>
change.  I know it's exciting to box and we want all boxes to be <br/>
found by everyone it seems.  It's just all part of the game, to not <br/>
find some and not figure some clues and locations out, and to have <br/>
some go missing.  If we all take responsibility for our own, I think <br/>
we would be on the right track.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope my 2 cents helped!  Keep on boxing!   Wingnut<br/>

be best to just leave out the driving directions to my own boxes, <br/>

 The best thing you can do is try to contact the <br/>

&gt; helping to maintain our boxes, but if the placer has abandoned it, <br/>
&gt; there's not a whole lot you can do.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I even went too far putting the little notebook in there for<br/>
something people could stamp in on or write on, but I didn't think it<br/>
would hurt anything.  I usually replace plastic baggies that are worn<br/>
or ripped or whatever.  Oh well, I think no harm was done, especially<br/>
since it's hidden again.  I'll keep trying to reach this person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as your clues, I would highly suggest that you make them a <br/>
&gt; seperate entity from this box.  Write them how you like including <br/>
&gt; directions and publish them.  I try to never give information in my <br/>
&gt; clues for other's boxes<br/>
<br/>
Good advice - I'll just leave out any reference at all to the other<br/>
box in my clues - I think at Atlas Quest other "boxes in the area" are<br/>
listed anyway.  It being stampless is really none of my business<br/>
anyway.  I do think I'll not give driving directions out of defence to<br/>
the other placer and her obvious desire to not have that given.  That<br/>
is really something that a person can find out on their own anyway.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please don't think I am telling you what to do, or that this is <br/>
&gt; written harshly, it is so hard to tell in emails!  <br/>
<br/>
I totally understand - I asked for advice and appreciate it all.<br/>
<br/>
 There are a whole <br/>
&gt; bunch of new boxers out there now, we love to see them, it means more <br/>
&gt; boxes!  But there is a huge trend happening that I see; people trying <br/>
&gt; to take on caring for everything.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I understand that too, have felt like I should DO SOMETHING when<br/>
I don't find a box just like I think it should be - I think maybe just<br/>
hiding it back again was all that was really called for, that and<br/>
trying to contact the placer.  A few more months/years under my belt I<br/>
will have run into more varied situations and won't need to obsess<br/>
about all this.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope my 2 cents helped!  Keep on boxing!   <br/>
<br/>
It did, absolutely - thanks again.<br/>

There is a Lost Lake in Bellingham, WA and a lot of boxes hidden at a lower elevation in the same park, Larrabee Park, but I have never seen clues for Lost Lake boxes.  Additionally, I have seen that there appears to be a way to drive up there, and have been interested in doing so for quite some time, but I don't know how to get there.  Even if we are not talking about the same Lost Lake, it is possible that others would like to know how to get to the one where you placed boxes, and do it via car.  I say put in driving directions to yours, but don't say anything about the other box...thing...<br/>
<br/>
I never realized what a thin line one walks when one writes clues, Wingnut.  Nobody has gotten mad and told me, but perhaps some people are pretty po'ed at me, and I don't even know about it...  Funhog, did you mind that I referred to your clues, saying you'd give directions to the park in California where I placed the Olive Tree Letterbox?  That's not telling anybody anything more about Funhog's box...it's just being lazy on my part...haha...<br/>

from 20 feet away right off the trail where it was supposed to be,<br/>
only with no "concave rock" as a covering.  It was closed and dry, a<br/>
nice tupperware-type box with a good seal.  I was tempted to bring it<br/>
home with me but decided to put a small notebook in there for people<br/>
to use stamping in and try again to contact the placer.  Had tried to<br/>
contact her before I went to get her OK for me to place boxes there -<br/>
receiving no reply I decided to go ahead and place them anyway.  Do<br/>
people often plant boxes with no stamp and/or log book?  There was a<br/>
recipe card in there saying something to the effect of "congratulation<br/>
on finding me, please write any comments you may have" but not much<br/>
more information than that, especially not her name or e-mail address.<br/>
Is a box without a stamp and/or log book considered trash even if<br/>
hidden?  This one is hidden again now, as I put it back in it's hole<br/>
and covered it with the rock as described in the clues, but I would<br/>
like to know what to do if I run into that situation again.  What do I<br/>
do if I don't get any reply at all from her?  I don't intend to go up<br/>
there for at least a year unless my boxes need attention.  I plan to<br/>
include a short blurb about her box in my own clues - is that a good<br/>
idea?  Seems the only way to alert people that the box is there but is<br/>
stamp-less.  Also, her clues don't give directions to the lake, says<br/>
"what would be the fun in that?", but I would like to give driving<br/>
directions because there is one way up there that is much shorter than<br/>
any other and not apparent on maps.  I'm thinking of waiting a few<br/>
days and then posting my clue with driving directions if I don't hear<br/>
from her - any opinions?<br/>

recent post is not the one in Washington. If you look <br/>

I didn't mind your reference to my CA box, I figured <br/>
you were "just being lazy." As a rule, I think it's a better <br/>
idea to put your own directions in your clues. If I were to <br/>
retire my box, then mine would not be available to <br/>
someone looking for your box. <br/>
<br/>
It has happened that I've had a box of mine referenced in <br/>
a clue that does bother me because it has revealed something <br/>
about my box that I would rather had remained a secret. For <br/>
this reason, I generally prefer to be asked before I am honored <br/>
by having a clue of mine mentioned in someone else's posting <br/>
but yours was no problema. Thanks for asking, Funhog<br/>

&gt;  Funhog, did you mind that I referred to your clues, saying you'd give directions to <br/>
the park in California where I placed the Olive Tree Letterbox?  That's not telling <br/>
anybody anything more about Funhog's box...it's just being lazy on my part...haha...<br/>

book and a few extra baggies and paper towels along with my kit.  I <br/>
sure appreciate when someone does a bit of maintence on my boxes.  I <br/>
just try not to alter them in any way.  And I leave them better hidden <br/>
then when I found them usually.  If I come along a box with a missing <br/>
or full log I will add a new one, (and email the placer about it) but <br/>
NEVER take the old one unless the owner asks me to.  I Leave full logs <br/>
in my own boxes also, that way people that visit can see who has been <br/>
there, the logbooks are a lot of fun to look at.  You'll be a seasoned <br/>
letterboxer in no time!   Wingnut<br/>

to some seasoned vetrans and figuring it all out as it happens.....  <br/>
Respect for people and their boxes and the way they do it is always <br/>
nice.  I figure, I can do my boxes my way, and everyone else's aren't <br/>
my responsibility now.....  That sounds harsh, but I suppose if <br/>
people want help they will ask?  <br/>
<br/>
After the "newness" wears off, you start to worry less, and enjoy <br/>
boxing more.  I have met several boxers now, I know their styles, <br/>
their likes and dislikes for their own boxes, clues, etc.  If I don't <br/>
know someone, I just leave it alone and resist the urge to "help" <br/>
until I contact them about it.  Seems to work the best for me at <br/>
least.  You may have, or have not offended someone already, trust me, <br/>
they will get over it!  If you don't tred on someone's toes around <br/>
here, you aren't boxing enough!  :)  Just keep doing what you are <br/>
doing!   Wingnut<br/>
