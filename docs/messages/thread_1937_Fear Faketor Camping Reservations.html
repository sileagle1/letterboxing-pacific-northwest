Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Despite the positive response we've gotten, we've only received 2<br/>
deposits (which were due today). If you or your group are interested <br/>
in<br/>
attending, we really need to hear from you. I spoke with park admin<br/>
this morning and they'll give us another week before releasing the <br/>
sites<br/>
we've reserved.<br/>
<br/>
We hope to hear from all those coming soon!<br/>
<br/>
