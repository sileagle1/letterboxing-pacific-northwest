Hello everyone!<br>
 Just wanted to report we had an awesome time visiting Bend. (We <br>
actually stayed in Sunriver.) We stayed a whole week, but still didn't <br>
have enough time to do everything we wanted. Sadly, the Lava land <br>
sites were closed still, (probably to open right after we left), but <br>
we did get quite a few other letterboxes. I also wanted to mention <br>
that we left a hitchhiker in the area, brought up from Rogue River. <br>
 Thanks again to everyone for their help and suggestions. <br>
familyT<br>
<br>
p.s. Sorry to 4Dtoes (and other boxers going to get these boxes), we <br>
did not have any colored markers to bring with us (as you suggest in <br>
the clues), so your awesome stamps are only 1 color right now.<br>
<br>
