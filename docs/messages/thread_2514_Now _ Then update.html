The two "Now &amp; Then" boxes were alive &amp; well when I repaired them on <br/>
1 Apr.  They should still be there. The "Now" container blends in <br/>

piece of bark with a bit of moss and leaves scattered about it that <br/>
would need moving in order to find it.  The box is lying flat on the <br/>
ground next to the stump.  I doubt it's gone missing unless mushroom <br/>
hunters got pretty aggressive this year.  ;)  Hope this helps,  <br/>

&gt; Tomorrow we are going to "Now and Then" in Seward Park.  I went <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; past weekend to check out the two boxes that are supposed to be <br/>
there.  <br/>
&gt; It is a beautiful walk through some old growth forest, but I <br/>
couldn't <br/>
&gt; find the first box.  Apparently the books had been switched out <br/>
about a <br/>
&gt; month ago, and the second box was there, so I just can't imagine <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; first one isn't there.  I know I found the right spot (stump with <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; baby  cedar).  Has anyone else been there and found the first <br/>
box?  The <br/>
&gt; stump has so many little nooks, I thought perhaps I missed it.  I <br/>
&gt; e-mailed the person at the address they left on the site, but <br/>
haven't <br/>
&gt; gotten a response.  Any advice on where the box is in that stump <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; be most appreciated. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many thanks<br/>
