for the past 10 days and upon returning to Korea I had 700+ emails <br>
to sort through (that includes purging about 246 of them while <br>
sitting in an internet cafe in Bangkok on day 2 of our trip and <br>
purging another 375 of them in an internet cafe in Siem Reap on day <br>
8) of which about 20 included questions about letterboxes.  The sad <br>
part is that most of these hundreds of emails were spam that somehow <br>
bypassed the filters we've set up!<br>
<br>
The two "Now & Then" boxes were alive & well when I repaired them on <br>
1 Apr.  They should still be there. The "Now" container blends in <br>
well with its hiding spot--no need to dig--there should only be a <br>
piece of bark with a bit of moss and leaves scattered about it that <br>
would need moving in order to find it.  The box is lying flat on the <br>
ground next to the stump.  I doubt it's gone missing unless mushroom <br>
hunters got pretty aggressive this year.  ;)  Hope this helps,  <br>
