I don't know if this is what your issue is, but it may be.  It's always<br>

That's a good point too.  =)  Though Yahoo and Hotmail recently upped<br>
their limit to 250 megabytes, so it's likely to take a LONG time<br>
before they fill up with messages from any of these talk lists. <br>
Unless, of course, you have lots of friends that send you photos with<br>
HUGE attachments, but then, that's what friends are for, right?  =)<br>
<br>
Another reason messages might bounce is if you ever set it to<br>
'auto-reply'.  That's more common at work when people are on vacation,<br>
but if you use an auto-replier, that'll cause Yahoo Groups to stop<br>
sending you e-mail as well.<br>

I got this from a Yahoo group owner and thought I would pass it along with <br>
her permission.<br>

      ADMIN: Please check your memberships<br>

      Hi Folks,<br>
      The last couple of days a lot of folks have started bouncing their<br>
      memberships. What does that mean? That means if you aren't getting <br>
list mail. It seems that many ISP's decided to make some changes and either <br>
add spamcop (that seems the most frequent one I run across) or change the <br>
ISP's on their blacklist.<br>
<br>
      I'm posting this to the group in the hope that some of you that <br>
stopped<br>
      getting mail will see this post and contact your ISP (or if you <br>
installed the<br>
      software on your computer make changes) and have them whitelist Yahoo <br>
Groups.<br>
<br>
      We're trying to reactivate many of the accounts (which is all I can do <br>
at<br>
      this point) but until this gets corrected the accounts will continue <br>
to bounce. Right now every time I log on I'm getting about a dozen new <br>
accounts bouncing.<br>
<br>
<br>
      Now some are probably saying but I'm set up to No Mail so that <br>
shouldn't affect me. Well it won't if you are No Mail on ALL of your Yahoo <br>
Groups but if even one of your groups starts to bounce e-mails, ALL of your <br>
groups will start to bounce whether your are on No Mail or not.<br>
<br>
      I'm sure many of you know where to go to check your bounce history but <br>
for<br>
      those who don't here are the steps.<br>
      Log into Yahoo Groups at http://groups.yahoo.com<br>
      Sign in with your Yahoo ID and password<br>
      Click on My Groups link<br>
      Click on the E-Mail Preferences link<br>
      Click on the Bounce History link<br>
<br>
      At the bottom of the page it will list the reason you are bouncing. <br>
This<br>
      should help you or your ISP fix the problem.<br>
<br>
      Thank you for your help in making our jobs a little easier.<br>
<br>
      And before I close, if you are going to be away from your computer for <br>
a<br>
      long period of time please make sure you set ALL of your groups to No <br>
Mail. I<br>
      know some groups don't allow it (in that case set to digest) but we <br>
aren't one<br>
      of them.<br>
<br>
      Thank you all for your help in this. You'll really help us get off <br>
this<br>
      computer and back to stamping!<br>
      Hugs,<br>
