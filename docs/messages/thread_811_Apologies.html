<br>
I realize that I come on strong, that's my nature. I'm sorry if that nature as alienated you, any of you, towards me.<br>
<br>
The website that I'm working on is not, nor has it ever been, a replacement for, or a splintering of, the main pre-existing LBNa website.  I am a PHP/MySQL web developer.  That's part of my career field. The website exists so that I can hone my skill set and I figured, apparently wrongly that I could do so by combining it with a hobby that I immensely enjoy.  It has never been my intentions to force anything on anyone.  The website is there for everyone to use or ignore as per their desires.  Same for the clue database.  Use it or not.  Your choice.<br>
<br>
Just for the record, I am a strong supporter of the current LBNa website and it's programmer, trust me, I know how much work he has put into it.<br>
<br>
As I write this, I'm reminded of something I've always said in the past and I need to remember it now.....<br>
<br>
"Never explain yourself, your friends don't need to hear it and your enemies won't believe it....."<br>
<br>
Perhaps in the future, I can overcome the initial irritation that I've caused and we can all just enjoy this hobby. So to Evil Glenn, Amanda, Ryan and anyone else, I'm sorry.<br>
