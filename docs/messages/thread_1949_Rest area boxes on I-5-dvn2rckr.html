Hi! I am sorry to hear you weren't able to locate all the LB's. I <br/>
have found 3 of the 4 and they were on Northbound I-5, the rogue <br/>
river one was there when I got it, umm...2 months ago, so it must <br/>
have gone MIA. Baseball godess, I accidently drove past the rest area <br/>
so wasnt able to get that one but was planning to stop there on my <br/>
way to the Gresham Clue gathering, maybe I wont now. hmm.. Anyways, <br/>
good luck to you on finding other Lb's :o) Hope to see you in Gresham <br/>
or Silver Falls :o)<br/>
Erfellie<br/>
