<br>
We're rapidly running out of time to 'repair' many of our LBs before <br>
we depart the area.  I have found some revised clues for one of <br>
our 'clueless' boxes of late, though.  So, I posted the amended <br>
clues to the Zug-WA Monster II letterbox in Tumwater, WA.  The <br>
original LB of this repeatedly went missing in a longterm 'turf <br>
battle' with area geocachers.  Eventually I surrendered the 'battle' <br>
as it just wasn't worth the mental anguish and wasted gasoline to <br>
the area anymore.  I decided to replant a 'new' letterbox in a <br>
totally different area of the park--so that explains the two <br>
different LBs listed on AQ.  I just posted the revised clue to <br>
this 'new' (although it's almost been there 2 years) location.<br>
<br>
In about a week or so I'll officially 'abandon' most of our WA/OR/ID <br>
letterboxes--in the event anybody in the area may be interested in <br>
adopting them.  I tried to scrub the clues to our remaining LBs on <br>
the sites to ensure they were as accurate as I can possibly tell <br>
(without compromising the intended mystery/intrigue incorporated in <br>
them) at the moment without laying my eyes on them in the process.  <br>
Hopefully this will help prevent a lot of confusion for <br>
future 'seekers' of these boxes.  But--as in life, you just never <br>
know until that time comes. If you're interested in adopting any <br>
specific LBs of our's out there, please contact me off-line. Thanks <br>
& have a great week,<br>
