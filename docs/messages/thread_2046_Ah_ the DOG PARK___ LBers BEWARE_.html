NOT where they said it would be.  In fact, the fence<br>
was within 5 feet of TROOP 2199 letterbox.  Took the<br>
troop out tonight to find it, only to get stopped by a<br>
fence we couldn't get through.  Found a gate in the<br>
middle of the field and walked around.  Found the box<br>
on the other side of the fence and nearly run over by<br>
LARGE machinery equipment.  NOT GOOD!!! <br>
<br>
There are SEVERAL of the animal tracks boxes that are<br>
in jeopardy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LILY<br>
<br>
If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br>
