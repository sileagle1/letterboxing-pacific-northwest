Any quick and easy letterboxs between Seattle and Great Falls?<br/>

My clue notebook is quite full, but I'd welcome any suggestions.<br/>

This will be my second attempt for Heart like an Awl, last time it got <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's south of your turnoff for Great Falls, but I'll ask anyway: are you<br/>
planning on looping down towards Yellowstone at all?  If you are, I can give<br/>
you more advice there.  Missoula had quite a few the last time I looked<br/>
online, but it's been a while since I went that direction.  I have no idea<br/>
what the LB situation is like now.  Don and Gwen have hidden a few in MT<br/>
outside of the park region and their finds are usually fairly easy with fun<br/>
stamps to boot.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck though.  It should be an interesting drive.  I like that country.<br/>
I wish I had some time to get up that way soon.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd recommend Sondog's boxes along I 90 in Idaho.  If its quick and easy you want look for What do you see?, Sunshine, and while I have not found it yet, Mullan Road is supposed to be great.  Another box, near Vantage is one of my personal favorites, Quick Draw, by Mike and Elaine.  Still can't believe this very cool spot is so close to I 90.  In Montana, Don and Gwen planted a few memorable boxes, especially if you are a Lewis &amp; Clark buff, Off the Trail is in one of those special places that you never forget.  Sacajawea's Brother is one of the coolest stamps we have in our collection.  Another beautiful stamp is The Prospector, by Mt Walker eastbound on I90 at the Gold Creek Rest Stop.  Near Missoula, there's The Tallest, by PotomicJoe, our first hybrid.  In Spokane, The Flying Squirrel Squad's Hants'aq 'ilpench/Spokane Bridge boxes are close to I 90.  Can't say it's quick, but it is an excellent series.  Another fun Spokane box is fat lady's Thousand Steps.  Very clever, and in a very intriguing spot, you'll have trouble tearing yourself away.  Another can't miss is Finch Arboretum, Stormcrow has Finch's Old Man Willow there and in a month the rhodies should be spectacular.  Amazing just how many letterboxes have been planted since we took that trip 1 1/2 years ago.  These are some of our personal favorites, I'm sure there are many more out there now.<br/>
