&gt;   I headed down to the City of Roses where I found rain--lots and <br/>
lots <br/>
&gt;   and lots of horrible, awful rain.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   But Pandora said all of you guys were getting "soft" and needed <br/>
a <br/>
&gt;   challenge, so at long last, I have placed the long awaited <br/>
Portland <br/>
&gt;   Walking Tour.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   The clues can be found at <br/>
&gt;   http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/OR/PdxWalkingTour<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It's COMPLETELY wheelchair and child accessible and requires <br/>
perhaps <br/>
&gt;   a couple of miles of walking around on city sidewalks.  You'll <br/>
more <br/>
&gt;   likely get hit by a car crossing a street or accosted by <br/>
homeless <br/>
&gt;   people begging for change than bitten by snakes or another <br/>
creatures <br/>
&gt;   of the outdoors.  =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I wanted to leave a prize for the first person to find the box, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt;   alas, it didn't happen.  But if you are the first to find this <br/>
box, <br/>
&gt;   I'll give you a pat on the back the next time I see you.  ;o)<br/>
