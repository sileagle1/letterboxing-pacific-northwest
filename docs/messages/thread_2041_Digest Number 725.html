(Lincoln Park's Lincoln Letterbox is back and better than ever. A New<br>
and Improved stamp image! Sorry to those who had liked the old stamp<br>
image, but at least everyone should be able to identify this one as<br>
Lincoln! :-)<br>
 <br>

<br>
Hi Amanda,<br>
Is this in Seattle or elsewhere? I also have a Lincoln Park box and it has<br>
an image of Lincoln, but its in Spokane.<br>

Amanda's flying somewhere at 30,000 feet at the moment, so I thought<br>
I'd reply for her. =)<br>
<br>
Yes, this Lincoln Park is in Seattle.  It even had a visit from The<br>
Amazing Race a few seasons back and we were horrified to learn that<br>
the roadblock wasn't to find the letterboxes in the park. Disgraceful!<br>
<br>
You're Lincoln Park is safe. Amanda hasn't replaced it for you. ;o)<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>

Hey, Amanda was hanging out around the same altitude as we were today <br>
(although we were probably in totally different quadrants of the <br>
world)!  ;)  I'm still amazed we were flying faster than 600 mph!!!  <br>
Almost the Concorde (but not quite)...  Woo hoo!!!<br>
<br>
It's great to be back home, where we can drink the water, not have to <br>
steer around 'one-eyed buffaloes' on the highways, we can instantly <br>
recognize the characters on the signs around town & we have access <br>
to 'soft' toilet paper!!!  Hee haw!<br>

And right up there with that observation--the fact that you can flush<br>
it down toilets! That's always a plus in my book....<br>

Amen, bro!  Believe me, I basically grew up in Europe--spent lots of <br>
time in East & West Germany with their very common sand-paper grit TP.  <br>
That truly made me appreciate the finer things in American life--such <br>
as Charmin TP!!! ;)<br>
