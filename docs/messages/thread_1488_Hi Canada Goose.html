to Lbing.  It took some work to find your boxes but we thoroughly enjoyed<br>
the whole experience.  Well.... maybe the mosquitoes were a bit much. LOL.<br>
Your stamps are good too.  We found our first hitchhiker in box #4... that<br>
was cool!  HH was unnamed.<br>
<br>
We go to Spokane to visit relatives once in a while.  Not sure it's often<br>
enough to be able to maintain boxes though... it's only once a year or even<br>
two years.<br>
<br>
Thanks for mentioning the TIME article.  Wow Funhog has celebrity status!<br>
<br>
If you're at the BG Lake Stamp Camp maybe we'll see you there... we're going<br>
for the day.<br>

Hello....I was wondering if anyone caught the article in Time<br>
Magazine last week???? Lucky for me it has lead to some new boxers in<br>
Spokane searching out one of our boxes....reason being I am moving to<br>
Spokane and out of the Portlannd Area....:( A little bummed but I am<br>
looking forward to it. Spokane however has 9 boxes!!!! And that is<br>
it! So all you LBPNW members when you head near Spokane on your<br>
travels please please please plant boxes during your stay. I will<br>
miss about my regular walks in Portland and hope to still maintain my<br>
boxes from there. I am sure you will all keep me posted on any<br>
challenges with the boxes....Thanks<br>
Canada Goose....<br>
