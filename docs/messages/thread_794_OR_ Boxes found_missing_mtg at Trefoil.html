characters by following Pandora's clues.  Unfortunately, we are quite sure that <br/>
Puff has taken a powder.  (Pandy, I will e-mail you off-list with specifics as <br/>
to where we looked.)  But the remaining 3 in the #1 Adventure are in place, <br/>
and we also just had time to squeeze in the first box from #2 Adventure before <br/>
we were forced by time constraints to call a halt.  Can't wait to get back and <br/>
follow this series--such clever clues and GREAT stamps.  A big and wonderful <br/>
effort by Pandy that moms &amp; kids alike appreciated! <br/>
<br/>
On Friday, we'd gone after the Trefoil LB and were annoyed to see that some <br/>
people had stopped on the trail, right near the log where we were sure the box <br/>
was waiting for us.  Some bird watchers or a class identifying plants...or <br/>
some people with stamps and baggies--hey!  Our first exchange in the field!  It <br/>
was the Bishop Clan (from out of town) and the Dixon Clan (who planted the <br/>
Browns Ferry LB in a wonderful little park I'd never knew existed--take your <br/>
binocs when you go!).  <br/>
<br/>
Between our trail exchange and the recent Fleshmens-Lennins/Funhog meeting, <br/>
it's getting kinda Connecticutty out here! <br/>
