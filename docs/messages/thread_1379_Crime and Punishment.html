There are 3 stamps carved for this series.... the first 2 were <br/>
placed for a gathering a summer or two ago.  I found the clues <br/>
on my hard drive... they were never published online.  E-mail me <br/>
offlist if you would like a copy.<br/>
<br/>
The third stamp is rattling around a tupperware with all my <br/>
carving stuff.  Funhog, as is typical, is probably the only one to <br/>
see this one.  I will get it placed one of these days.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Why would there be boxes with no published clues?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, the boxes are in locations that the authorities don't want <br/>
them to be, and the placer doesn't want to adversize that fact.  <br/>
Sometimes, the placer just doesn't want a lot of people finding the <br/>
box--especially if they feel it may be hazardous to the health of the <br/>
box.  Othertimes people just want to do something a bit differently.  <br/>
And for many letterboxers, it harkens back to the Dartmoor history <br/>
where letterboxers didn't have the Internet to distribute clues and <br/>
it was very secrative and undercover.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, there's a lot of reasons someone might choose not to <br/>
publish clues.  I've been to events where there are 'temporary boxes' <br/>
just for those that go to the event--no reason to publish those clues <br/>
since they won't last for more than the afternoon.  Other boxes are <br/>
strictly for certain type of people--those with F counts over 100 or <br/>
500 or whatever the case may be--and you have to join the clue before <br/>
getting the clue.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure I've missed some reasons, but those are the ones I can think <br/>
of off the top of my head.  =)<br/>

<br/>
I think you answered your own question. :)<br/>
<br/>
seriousLy, somE folks may want to increase the challenGe for <br/>
particular boxEs. having the clue unpublished, or published in a <br/>
nonstandaRd way, are methods of aChieving that. i've heard rumors of <br/>
cLUEs arriving mysteriously mailBoxes and being cLeverly hidden On <br/>
personal web sites and even in chat list messaGes. if i were up for <br/>
Some Particular creativity this mOrning I mighT have even hidden <br/>
something in this message. btw, niCe tO see Mudstumpers post, i had <br/>
just noticed we hadn't heard from y'all in a while.<br/>
