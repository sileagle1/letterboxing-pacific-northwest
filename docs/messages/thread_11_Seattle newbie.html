<br>
Just reporting in as a relatively new LBer, with only a few finds to <br>
my name.  I'm learning that the proper thing to do once you find a <br>
box is to report the status to the owner over the list, so sorry <br>
about not doing this previously.  Hopefully the weather will hold <br>
this weekend and I can get out and get a few more finds...<br>
<br>
Thanks for the separate list, by the way!  What a relief not to sort <br>
through all those messages to find the PNW gems!<br>

<br>
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say it's the "proper" thing to do, but <br>
the owners usually do like to hear it's doing okay--especially if <br>
it's in a distant location placed during a vacation and the box is <br>
essentially an orphan.<br>
<br>
But e-mailing the owner is fine if you're not inclined to post the <br>
message publically.  I *usually* try to do that myself, but I've been <br>
known to post publically if I really wanted to rave about how great a <br>
box is.  =)  And occasionally I just forget to inform the owner.  <br>
It's not really that big of deal, though.  (At least in my opinion!)<br>
