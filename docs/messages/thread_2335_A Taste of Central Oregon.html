again" added at the end.  4dtoes has deleted the original box clues,<br/>
so the name of the new box is now the same as the old as of this<br/>
morning.  Just to avoid confusion from what some might see in the<br/>
announce list - this box contains 4dtoes' original three-part stamp (a<br/>
unique and beautiful image) but is in a new location with a new log<br/>
book and will be maintained by me, Calli-K.  <br/>
