Doggie Dog took a tour of boxes in South Thurston County and <br/>
North Lewis County today.  We successfully found Eagle Eye at <br/>
Tenino Park ( a great hike to this one); Lost Locomotive at <br/>
Shaeffer Park in Centralia; Find Letterbox at Fort Borst Park, <br/>
Centralia; Jacksons Cabin near Mary's Corner;  and the Outlaw <br/>
Tracy Catch Me Series box- The Duel in Napavine.  All boxes in <br/>
great shape and ready for more visitors.  Experienced a "Fare" <br/>
amount of "Sunshine" as "Well" (HH, you may have to put those <br/>
in the correct order).  It was still shining when we left one of the <br/>
boxes.  Added several new stamps to our books and finally <br/>
broke 100 (adding F's, HH's, and E's)!!  Had planned to see the <br/>
Rainbow and meet Kenny at the Dell but those will have to wait <br/>
for another day.<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was a great way to spend an Easter afternoon with the <br/>
family. ---- Letterboxing, what a great family thing.<br/>
