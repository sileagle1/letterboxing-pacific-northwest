been very little letterboxing activity in the southern parts of the <br/>
state. We have some really great letterboxes here, and not just mine, <br/>
Sandi has a few planted (under my name, but the clue directions will <br/>
say if its hers) and hers are out in Galice and she has some really <br/>
great boxes, particularly "Mystical" and "passion on the rocks" (its <br/>
about her/her husband/me/anyone elses love of rock-climbing). They <br/>
have been sitting there for months and no one has yet to hunt them <br/>
out. I must say she is getting a little disheartened since she put <br/>
alot of time and effort into carving these great stamps, I keep <br/>
telling her to not be so dissapointed...If you carve, they will <br/>
come...it just might take them awhile hehe :oP<br/>
For anyone who is up for a cute love story read on, all others stop <br/>
here! Sandi made the passion on the rocks letterbox to commemorate <br/>
her engagement to her (now) husband. They were out rock-climbing at <br/>
Broughtons Bluff 2 years ago and once they had reached teh top of <br/>
this enormous rock wall, he slyly whipped out a beautiful emerald <br/>
ring and proposed to her on top of the rocks. Of course she was so <br/>
thrilled and excited she had some difficulty rapelling back down to <br/>
the ground haha and this is actually how we found out about <br/>
letterboxing. Once they had come down and packed up their gear, they <br/>
saw a tupperware container that they thought was someones trash (the <br/>
Broughts Bluff Letterbox) so without looking at the contents they <br/>
picked it up and took it with them to throw away, so they threw it in <br/>
the truck and headed back home to southern oregon. When they got home <br/>
they opened it up before throwing it away (luckily) and saw what it <br/>
was and emailed the owner and mailed it back to him (and from there <br/>
we learned about LBing). Ironically there was a hitch-hiker in it, <br/>
the LOVE hitch hiker (it was only the V letter though, we still have <br/>
yet to find the other letters) and so it was perfect timeing for that <br/>
particular HH to be in the letterbox, Sandi was so sentimental about <br/>
this HH that she kept it for a year (sorry to whoever was looking for <br/>
the V) and refused to place it in another box until I finally <br/>
convinced her that it was time to let it go, so we put it in a Funhog <br/>
box :)So anyways, the Passion on the rocks LB is to commemorate that <br/>
day up there on broughtons bluff where her whole life changed (for <br/>
the better)and now she is very happily married to a good solid, but <br/>
sometimes dorky, man :oP<br/>

<br/>
Don't despair, there will be visitors but they may <br/>
just take their own sweet time. My very first letterbox <br/>
was placed in Central Oregon and there was not a <br/>
single other box (or letterboxer) within fifty miles at <br/>
the time. It took over a year for the first stamp to <br/>
show up in that logbook but I cannot tell you how <br/>
exciting it was the day I saw that first entry! That box <br/>
has been in place for nearly four years and in that time, <br/>
it has see the light of day only about a half dozen times. <br/>
I figure anyone who has made it all the way to this out <br/>
of the way place deserves extra credit.<br/>
<br/>
There are now four actual letterboxers in the area and <br/>
many boxes besides mine. We still hide our letterboxes <br/>
for each other but Central Oregon now is home to nearly <br/>
a hundred letterboxes. A while ago, someone left a box with <br/>
a commercial stamp in it but virtually all the rest are home <br/>
to handcarved stamps. The letterboxes in less populous <br/>
areas will always have fewer visitors, as will the boxes on <br/>
longer hikes. However, I just figure that makes these more <br/>
special, collectors' items of sorts. <br/>
<br/>
Keep the faith! Funhog<br/>

<br/>
Don't worry.  You'll have visitors to your boxes in time.  I'm <br/>
actually part of that 'odd' faction of letterboxers that prefers the <br/>
far flung planted letterboxes to the urban, overpopulated areas.  My <br/>
business trip/letterboxing reprieve from purgatory last weekend is <br/>
perfectly indicative of that--we drove 280 miles OUT OF THE WAY to <br/>
look for a handful of letterboxes in Wallowa County, Oregon instead <br/>
of following the highly letterbox-populated route along the <br/>
interstate on our way to Boise. <br/>
<br/>
As for your neck of the woods, we've found several boxes in <br/>
Merlin/Galice already--unfortunately, that was a long time ago, <br/>
different LB planters and under different 'life' circumstances.  <br/>
We'll likely pass through that region again next January, so we hope <br/>
to attempt some of your boxes then.  I'LL DEFINITELY NEED THE <br/>
VACATION!!!<br/>
<br/>
As for some boxes I've planted, I've had two, in exquisite <br/>
locations, that went unvisited for over 2 years.  Only recently I <br/>
received a message from somebody saying they found one of those <br/>
boxes that we planted in April 2003.  Folks will eventually find <br/>
them!!!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile enjoy the adventure and think about how much less LB <br/>
maintenance you'll have to do on your boxes over time.  ;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi! I hope nobody thought I was complaining, I was just kind randomly <br/>
writing, its been so long since I have conversed with anyone on this <br/>
list. Nice to here from you Dv2rckr (did I spell that right?). I must <br/>
agree I love hiking for boxes more so than urban drive-bys, even <br/>
though I do have a couple drivebys, I try to make the clues a bit <br/>
more creative, or put it on a short hiking trail because I know this <br/>
is a great family sport and those with little ones sometimes cant <br/>
make the long hikes. I love the long hikes when seeking an LB though <br/>
because it creates memories, rather than just a 5 minute driveby LB <br/>
which can be forgotten(not much happened) but when your out hiking <br/>
for a few hours lots can happy, great conversations, scenery, animal <br/>
sighting, sprained ankles, being stabbed in the butt-cheek by a tree <br/>
branch and ripping a huge hole in your pants and your cheek and <br/>
bleeding all over the place while your best friend laughs <br/>
hysterically...all of which has happened to me...and climbing up a <br/>
lighthouse cliffside holding onto a pompas grass and laughing so hard <br/>
you think you might pee when you see your best friend fall and <br/>
dissapear into the pompas grass below...being attacked by a vicious <br/>
rabid sheep with big horns and a mean glare...being surrounded by <br/>
blackbears and yelling as loud as I can and waving my arms till they <br/>
ran away as my golden retriever stares stupidly at me wondering what <br/>
i am doing...ohh there is so much fun to be had in those long hikes!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh and as far as the remote letterboxes go, that never get visitors, <br/>
one of them is Paradise Lodge in Agness, OR. When we found it I think <br/>
it had been there for 2 or 3 years and I think we might have been the <br/>
3rd people to visit it, that was one of the best hiking memories and <br/>
LB hunt we have ever had! Anyone who has the chance to do it, DO IT, <br/>
dont be deterred by the length of hoke, its well worth it, its like <br/>
heaven out there!<br/>

couple of years ago! We were there but there were so few boxes! Now, thanks to <br/>
your email, I've printed out about 15 new ones for us to find when we're up <br/>
there for our annual Shakespeare trip (15th year for us!) on August 6 &amp; 7. Love <br/>
the story about Passion on the Rocks! We'll be sure to look for that one.<br/>
<br/>
On our last couple of trips, we're found our very favorite boxes: Burnt <br/>
Turkey (great stamp!), Big Pine (wonderful place and clue) and Applegate Rest stop <br/>
(wheww!).<br/>
<br/>
We plan to replant our Shakespeare #2 box and maybe a couple of others too.  <br/>

<br/>
We will be vacationing in S. Oregon this fall and would like to include letterboxing.  However, we are unable to "hike" distances and rugged terraine due to a severed ACL.  Can you help us determine which boxes (if any) will be mild and short easy hikes?<br/>
<br/>
We will be all over southern Oregon.  We will be basing out of K-Falls.  Plans include, Crater Lake, Oregon Caves, Rogue River, Volcanic Area, maybe Steens Mtn, the Redwoods/N Calif. and anyplace else we have time for, and then some....  <br/>
