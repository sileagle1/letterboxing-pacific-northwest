<br/>
I'm thinking of making a Letterbox that would materialize only at the<br/>
regular First Friday Ceilis in Salem at the VFW Hall at the<br/>
intersection of Church and Hood Streets. (this month it's Friday Oct<br/>
5th - 7-11 PM) <br/>
<br/>
Every month it would have something new and cool in it. Won't have<br/>
time to create one for this month, but thinking a bout starting it in<br/>
November.<br/>
<br/>
Could this work and would it be attractive to letterboxers?<br/>

<br/>
  There are series out there already much like what you're describing, so I'm sure yours would be a wonderful addition to the world of boxes.  The one that comes to mind is SHH's Festival Letterbox, which changes throughout the year based on holidays.  (You can see it here:  http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=9676 and I hope I'm not violating any rules by posting the address!)<br/>
<br/>
  Incidentally, there are also boxes that move locations, either because the previous location was not a good enough hiding spot or for other reasons.  This can get tougher, since the clues have to change each time, instead of just the contents of the box.  Traveling event boxes, however, don't exactly have clues, so they get passed from event to event and are mailed to people all over to share.<br/>
<br/>
  Good luck in all your 'boxing ventures!<br/>

Ooh, that would be cool!<br/>
I promise that if we're ever down that way we'd make a special effort<br/>
to get it.<br/>
Do you ever come up to Seattle or Tacoma to dance? If you do, let me<br/>
know - it would be fun to exchange.<br/>

gatherings.  I change the stamp each time, to reflect the occassion, <br/>
but it's always in the same container.  It is a 'hidden in plain <br/>
sight' box, but people still need to find it.  <br/>
<br/>
I've been doing this for over a year (and I go to a lot of <br/>
gatherings).  When I started, I worried that people would be bored or <br/>
disappointed since once they have found it the first time, they would <br/>
know what to look for next time.  However, the feedback I receive has <br/>
been positive and folks seem disappointed if for some reason I didn't <br/>
do it.  I guess the lure of PZKut is too great to resist.<br/>

Have fun!<br/>
