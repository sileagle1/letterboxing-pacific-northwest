Everyone seemed to agree that there the bounty of boxes was <br>
thrilling.  I think some of the newcomers got a chance to see the <br>
variety of stamps techniques and got ideas.  I talked about my <br>
favorite clues and certainly met with some challenge at finding some <br>
of the hidden boxes at Wapato.<br>
<br>
There are some tricks up the sleeve, starting with one reminiscent of <br>
my favorite T&E box..... starting at the correct parking lot!<br>
<br>
I took away a postal LB from Pandora and Iron Bear.  I was touched by <br>
Iron Bears story inside and I am honored that Pandora choose this one <br>
for me.  I know someone who needs this box next, both for healing and <br>
in thanks, so I will send it on Monday.<br>
<br>
Now I am off to plant a box carved by Pandora and will be "putting up <br>
some BIG numbers"<br>
<br>
Thanks to Steve and the rest of the gang for a great time.<br>
