                    <div class="plaintext-content">I havne't heard of anyone else using "The Goddess" but then I've only <br>
been around for a few months. If all else just add "West Coast" to it <br>
to clarify which "goddess" you may be! <br>
I got lucky and no one else that I know of in the Miniature Bull <br>
Terrier world letterboxes with the exception of my dog's breeder. So <br>
didn't have to have this worry when coming up with a name/stamp <br>
design. But then...I'm the one who introduced my dog breeder into <br>
letterboxing! She is now going to introduce her grandsons to the <br>
hobby. Alas they don't have alot of boxes in the San <br>
Bernadino/Victorville area of CA. But they are of the mindset that if <br>
they hide some ...others will come!!<br>
SO..if all else...a name that is unique to you will happen one way or <br>
another! My husband is in the same dilemma..he can't come up with a <br>
name/signature stamp that he likes the "ring" of yet. So he is <br>
sticking with "Officer MAB" until then...<br>
Don't give up!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Pandora for sharing about "Wild Woman" already being in use. She very<br>
graciously emailed me, and so I have chosen to be "The Goddess" instead.<br>
Does anyone know if that name is in use?? I don't want to duplicate anyone's<br>
name, yet I want the name to be special and unique to me.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
The Goddess (at least until I find out if this name's in use!<br>
