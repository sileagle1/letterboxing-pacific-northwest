We are from East Wenatchee, just 3 hours away from you.  We started <br>
letterboxing last summer and are having fun doing it.  There are two other <br>
families I know of in East Wenatchee who are also letterboxers.  We do have <br>
a few planted in our area.  I see Spokane has quite a few but we haven't <br>
been able to get over there yet - usually when we travel we are heading the <br>
Seattle way.<br>
