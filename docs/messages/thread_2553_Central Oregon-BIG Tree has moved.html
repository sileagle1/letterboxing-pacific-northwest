one be sure to print out new clues as they have changed.<br/>
<br/>
We also checked "Eagles Nest" and funny thing is when we planted this box the tree just <br/>
looked like a great spot for a Bird of Prey to nest but there wasn't a nest. Now a huge nest <br/>
is right on top of the tree. It probably isn't an Eagle but definetly a Bird of Prey. The box is <br/>
well and waiting for visitors! <br/>
