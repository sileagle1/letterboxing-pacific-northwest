                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're ondering if any area letterboxers would be interested in a little <br>
get-together at Ft Steilacoom Park in Lakewood (South of Tacoma) on the <br>
afternoon of Sunday, 9 Oct 05?<br>
<br>
There's a new 'cool' playground there adjacent some picnic tables and a <br>
bunch of letterboxes to seek out in the park and several dozen more <br>
within a few mile radius of the park.<br>
<br>
Just throwing this out to see if there is any interest in it.  Let me <br>
know if anybody wants to link up and then we'll work on the details <br>
later.  <br>

family had a great time and we have since placed our first stamp.<br>
<br>
For us to be able to consider doing a weekend get-together it would need<br>
to be on a Saturday.<br>
<br>
What are others thinking?<br>
