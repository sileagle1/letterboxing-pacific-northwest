letterboxing, moved, what?<br>
<br>
Also, I managed to track down his list of boxes. <br>
<br>
I had to do it through "Getting Started" on the website to a link on <br>
carving by Mitch Klink (Der Mad), then through the article to the <br>
bottom to a link to examples of Der Mad's carvings.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Der Mad Stamper appears to be the ultimate mystery box.  No one has been able <br>
to locate him for a long time.  I think the general consensus is that we <br>
should divide up and maintain his boxes until such time as he (hopefully!) <br>
reappears.<br>
<br>
I had assumed you could use "Search for Boxes" to find his boxes (for placer, <br>
choosing DerMadStamper) --but I just tried it--and the only boxes that showed <br>
up are those already adopted (in WA).  All his unclaimed boxes are currently <br>
listed under the placer "Abandonedbox."  If you are familiar with the name of <br>
a Stamper box, you could find it thru Abandonedbox--otherwise, you'll have to <br>
go the longer route Susan described in her e-mail (titled What happened to Der <br>
Mad Stamper?).<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The last time I saw Mitch (Der Mad Stamper) was at the 1st Portland <br>
Letterboxers get together a couple years ago.  At that time he was <br>
just finishing up his degree at the Rock Creek campus, and I had <br>
heard he was offered and had accepted a web developer position at one <br>
of the east side colleges.  I believe he had plans to move his family <br>
to that side of the city, Gresham, if memory serves.  I can't <br>
remember which college it was, maybe Mt. Hood Community <br>
College, ...maybe not.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I'm pretty good at using the Internet to find people so <br>
let me give it a whirl and see what I can find.  If I find him, I'll <br>
ask him to make a guest appearance or send an email stating his <br>
wishes with his boxes.  If I can't find him or he doesn't respond, I <br>
say we divvy the boxes up among many to keep them alive at least.<br>
<br>
One suggestion when this whole subject of Abandoned Boxes came up, <br>
was to credit the creator of the box(es) and also state our contact <br>
info. for the maintainer.  I like that approach and it gives credit <br>
where due.<br>
<br>
What exactly is the process to adopt another's box?  I've sent a <br>
couple emails to the folks managing the Yahoo Group and LbNa Web <br>
Site, but have received no responses.<br>
