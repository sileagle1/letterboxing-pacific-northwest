I like it when people say nice things about other's boxes. Everyone needs warm fuzzies about their boxes because they have left part of themselves out to share with others. Personally, if you have something not nice to say, say it in private though. I love it when people like Charlie Trail Duster give the big run down report about where he's been and how the boxes are. <br/>

PS- "It's a bird, it's a plane" in Oregon City is alive and well. I checked on it this weekend on my way to Canby. Because I have received several reports that it was missing, I took a flashlight in case the box had slipped farther into the wall. But it was right there when I pulled the right rock out. <br/>
