One of my maintenance people found one of your boxes with stamp near our steam <br>
locomotive on display.  It had been moved around on the pavement by crows. I <br>
would like to replace it so the "game can continue". We are located at the World <br>
Forestry Center museum in Washington Park in Portland, Oregon. (4033 SW Canyon <br>
Rd, Portland, 97221).  If you can give me some idea where to replace it, I will <br>
be happy to do this.  The stamp is of a train, so I assume near the train.  I am <br>
very familiar with geochaching, and live near the first one.<br>
