at the correct spot as I got firsties on this cool cool box, as well <br/>
as my first hitch hiker, and since I was in the area and know <br/>
Wingnut hasn't been there I thought I would check on it.  Gone!!  I <br/>
called Wingnut from the spot to confirm I was in the right spot <br/>
after I scoured the bushes and surounding area.  While talking to <br/>
her on the cell phone I looked in the very stinky garbage and found <br/>
the lid to the box.  Confirmed gone :(  Not sure what Wingnut plans <br/>
to do but I know she'll keep us posted.  <br/>
<br/>
I did find Royal Angler alive and well and very well hidden.  <br/>
<br/>
The Salmon are coming in the little river and up to the fish <br/>
hatchery.  If you haven't been at McIver lately It is so worth the <br/>
trip.  There are gigantic Salmon in the ladder and in the locks.  <br/>
Very cool!<br/>
