replacement and headed out this afternoon to put it in its home. I was<br>
horrified to see the damage done to the area where the letterbox was<br>
hidden. My hope is that it was not the work of frustrated letterboxers<br>
but that of some pinhead miscreants. With great trepidation, I put the<br>
box in its cubbyhole, cleaned up the area and scattered needles and<br>
leaves to try to make the area look natural once again. Hopefully,<br>
future visitors will do their best to tread lightly, erase their<br>
tracks and avoid further disruption to the area. Funhog<br>
