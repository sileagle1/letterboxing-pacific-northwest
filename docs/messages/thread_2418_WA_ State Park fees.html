It figures--just as we're moving away they lift the fee.  I feel like <br>
we've invested in the parks, though--we've spent at least $150 in park <br>
fees just so we could letterbox a bit these past couple of years.  <br>
Compare that with out $40 Oregon State Park pass that was good for 2 <br>
years!<br>

Perhaps a better alternative would be a smaller daily use fee. Say $1<br>

We really hope that this move will not result in more park closures. <br>
It always seems to come back to that whenever there is any talk of<br>

I would be content to continue paying $5 per day if it keeps the parks<br>

An entire lack of a fee seems like it would encourage people to treat the<br>
state parks much as they do city parks- an extension of their backyards<br>
that they  can do whatever they like in and don't have to bother to clean<br>
up after themselves in. :P That and I also wonder about the closures<br>
thing- they've had to close some for lack of funding, and now they're<br>
taking away one source of funding? That doesn't seem to make much sense.<br>
