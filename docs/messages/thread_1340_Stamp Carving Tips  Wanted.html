carving tips for the carving workshop at the Great Lakes Gathering <br/>
next month.  Since I know there is some awesome carving talent in <br/>
this area of the country, I am hoping for a few tips from some of <br/>
you to add to the list.  You can either e-mail me direct or post to <br/>
the group.<br/>
<br/>
I will also be including a page or two of sample carved images from <br/>
other letterboxers and would love to have a few contributions <br/>
from 'boxers outside the Great Lakes area.  If you would like to <br/>
share an image you have carved, please e-mail me a scanned B/W image <br/>
no smaller than actual size at 72 or greater resolution.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
