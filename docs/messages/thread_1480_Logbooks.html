                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well now I'm in quite a quandry. I started out using unlined artbooks and<br>
little journals for my letterboxes. Then for convinience sake, I started<br>
getting lined memo pads when I was in a hurry and couldln't get to the art<br>
store. I now have them in a couple of my letterboxes. Having seen lined<br>
memo pads in other folks' letterboxes, I thought it was no big deal. I will<br>
make an effort to get back into the unlined swing of things.<br>
<br>
Late Saturday night, my letterboxing friends, my wife and I decided to<br>
climb Little Mt. Si near Northbend, Washington. I got up at 5:30 am on<br>
Sunday morning and whipped out a hand carved stamp. I dug around my<br>
letterboxing supplies and all I had was a lined memo pad. I quickly put<br>
together a letterbox with all its various supplies and markings. Then out<br>
the door we went. The letterbox was placed with its less than perfect<br>
contents. I am planning on a series of letterboxes on the way up Little Si.<br>
Next time up, I'll replace the memo with a better journal. Whew. Who knew?!<br>
<br>
On the plus side, I double bagged my logbook after reading Amanda from<br>
Seattle's post. I also added the silica packets someone suggested to keep<br>
moisture out as well. We have lots of them at my work.<br>
<br>
I've seen some of the hand made logbooks from folks on this list and they<br>
rock. Perhaps I too will strive for those lofty goals. But in a pinch, ya<br>
gotta go with whacha got, eh?<br>

I've seen this phenomenon before -- I wonder what draws people so to the <br>
lined pages? Maybe it's some subconscious return to penmanship class in 3rd <br>
grade...<br>
