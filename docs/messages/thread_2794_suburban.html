&gt; So I just got my new Family Fun magazine and the darn thing opened <br/>
right away to this heavy <br/>
&gt; stock page with pull up flaps all about the Chevy Suburban and it <br/>
is called "Welcome to <br/>
&gt; Letterbox Camp". I'm all for advertising, but with our "leave no <br/>
trace" ethic, wouldn't it be <br/>
&gt; better for us to be sponsored by some fuel efficient car than the <br/>
gas guzzling Suburban????<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The back of the ad is all about letterboxing and even provides an <br/>
image of the Suburban for <br/>
&gt; you to xerox and make into a stamp (ugg!)...at least they're <br/>
encouraging people to make their <br/>
&gt; own stamps! It actually is pretty well done...Suburbans just bug <br/>
me. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I tried the familyfun link at the bottom <br/>
(www.familyfun.com/letterboxcamp), but it doesn't <br/>
&gt; seem to work (yet?).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just thought I'd throw out my opinion and let those of you who <br/>
don't get the magazine know <br/>
&gt; about the ad. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We agree with the "leave no trace" philosophy.   Funny how things change though. Over the years we've gone from bicycle camping to car camping and then, due to health, RV camping.  Our letter boxing excursions are done with a Honda and that leaves a smaller "trace".  We love getting out to box however we can!  <br/>
