                    <div class="plaintext-content">We agree with the "leave no trace" philosophy.   Funny how things change though. Over the years we've gone from bicycle camping to car camping and then, due to health, RV camping.  Our letter boxing excursions are done with a Honda and that leaves a smaller "trace".  We love getting out to box however we can!  <br>
