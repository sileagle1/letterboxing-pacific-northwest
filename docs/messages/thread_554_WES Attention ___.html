HELP!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was under the impression form your e-mail to me Goosey that you <br/>
wanted your boxes claimed by someone down here.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking about you today at the get together ( were your ears <br/>
burning??)<br/>
<br/>
Wes G. monitors this list, perhaps he can get your registration <br/>
debugged and your name attached to your boxes where they belong.<br/>
<br/>
We all agree that you are missed and hope all is well.  If you need <br/>
help with a site visit or check-in, repair etc don't hesitate, you <br/>
know where to find us.<br/>
<br/>
