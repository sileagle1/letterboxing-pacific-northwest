                    <div class="plaintext-content">OMG ... what fun the evening was! Good suggestion for a meeting <br>
place, Funhog ... the Free Range Red was very smooth and my first <br>
organic micro-brew. However, I think I've developed an addiction for <br>
those delicious garlic fries.<br>
<br>
I'd like to thank Funhog, Keith (alleged non-boxer), Maiden, <br>
Kittypiller, Wingnut & spouse for coming out. I really enjoyed <br>
sharing boxing stories and getting to know each of you a little.  <br>
<br>
What a kick to be at the same table with someone who inspired the <br>
only Postal Lb I've created.  (hehhehehe .... you guys know my postal <br>
is called "Beating a Dead Horse" don't you?) I think I may have to <br>
get Dead Horse to said individual for a stamping in. <br>
<br>
It was so nice of all of you to share your logbooks and allow me to <br>
see some really fantastic stamp images.  Thanks also for adding your <br>
images to my logbook. (Yippie ... I'm no longer an "exchange <br>
virgin"!!) <br>
<br>
For those who are traveling today ... Have a safe trip back home to <br>
Washington and Funhog, I know its a business trip, but I envy your <br>
location (Hawaii)!!! Hope you get a chance to break away for some <br>
boxing while you're there. <br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

ps: Hey, I forgot to get a "ruling" last night on Virtual Lb's ... do <br>
they count as a P or not? <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was a grand evening.  Getting to meet more of the local (and not so<br>
local) letterboxers was a delight.  I must say that kittypiller is the most<br>
well behaved child I've met in a good long time! (And working in the schools<br>
I see a lot of them ;) It was great to finally meet The Green Turtle, Amanda<br>
from Seattle, and Wingnut.  I am looking forward to meeting up with them<br>
again and hopefully getting a chance to go out boxing with Wingnut and<br>
Kittypiller one of these days!<br>
