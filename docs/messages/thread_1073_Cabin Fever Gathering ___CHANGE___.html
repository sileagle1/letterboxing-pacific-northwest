                    <div class="plaintext-content">Due to the large turn out of people, we're going to change from Shari's on<br>
Beavercreek Rd to Izzy's.  It's in the same shopping center.  Shari's would<br>
not take reservations and would not garuntee that we would even be in the<br>
same part of the building.  Izzy's gave us half of the banquet room for no<br>
charge.<br>
<br>
The time is still 12:00 PM for stamp exchange and stamping into the postal<br>
letter box.  We'll head over to Clackamas Community College for letterboxing<br>
after everyone is done eating and kibbitzing.  If you have contact<br>
information for someone that was planning, I would GREATLY appreciate it if<br>
you would make sure they get the change of venue.<br>
<br>
I will also let the hostess at Shari's know to redirect anyone that doesn't<br>
get the message.<br>

still count on me and Cat's Meow to be there and since I am picking <br>
up Willow and kids, they will be there as well. See you then!<br>
