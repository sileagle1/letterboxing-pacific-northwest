now that I've got a kiddo working there.  I got out Thursday and found <br>
one of daelphinus' little gems.  My heart sank a little when I finally <br>
pulled it out of it's hidie-hole--the plastic box was filled to the <br>
top with water and a waterlogged worm was floating inside. Not only <br>
that but the plastic baggie holding the stamp and logbook was wet <br>
too.  When I got to the bag holding the logbook, it was sealed tight <br>
and the handmade book inside was bone dry!  Thanks to The White Family <br>
who had been there about 1 month ago, every bag was closed tightly and <br>
the box survived.  <br>
<br>
I re-planted the plastic box upside down in hopes that it might stay <br>
drier inside, but who knows? It was raining sideways just the day <br>
before.  There is nothing worse than a moldy, smelly logbook and it is <br>
so easy to keep them dry.<br>

Thanks for the update.  Another trick, too, is using industrial <br>
grade zippered plastic bags--and double-bagging those, too.  They <br>
come at a hefty price (especially when I had to by them in <br>
industrial business bulk lots just to find them) but they outperform <br>
even the toughest ziplock freezer bags anyday.  Yes, and definitely <br>
closing the bag properly helps, too. ;) I tried to 'fix up' most of <br>
our WA area boxes as well as possible for the long haul anticipating <br>
the rains by changing out the logbooks to waterproof paper and the <br>
industrial plastic bags but as time neared for our big 'unwelcome' <br>
move out east it became obvious we weren't going to be able to <br>
revisit each of the surviving boxes.  Yes--many kudos to the White <br>
Family for taking the time to ensure the bags were tightly sealed <br>
and much thanks to Colls for the positive status report on a <br>
letterbox (that about 6 months ago we came about 5 minutes away from <br>
just retiring it to make life a bit easier on us in absentia).  That <br>
kind act is greatly appreciated and is a nice and very welcome <br>
change to most of the status reports on our (quickly disappearing) <br>
letterboxes we get the majority of the time!!!<br>
<br>
Hope everybody in the PNW is drying out these days!  All this <br>
national coverage of all the rains is making us even more homesick <br>
for the PNW region than before...  :(  We didn't get the massive <br>
rains on this side of the country as you all did but we did have to <br>
deal with tornadoes and fallen trees just about as far as your eyes <br>
can see a few days ago.  Have a wonderful Thanksgiving!<br>
