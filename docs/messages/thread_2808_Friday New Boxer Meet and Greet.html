                    <div class="plaintext-content">This week I have been teaching a very small family class on letterboxing at<br/>
my elementary school. We are going out on Friday to Milo McIver Park to<br/>
break in their newly carved sig stamps and skills. If anyone is going to be<br/>
around and would like to come and say hello, exchange stamps, and join the<br/>
hunt we will be in the Riverside Picnic Area in the SOUTHERN Day Use Area at<br/>
about 11:30ish. (We may be a minute or two late getting there). We plan to<br/>
exchange and set up until approximately 12:30 when we will hit the trail to<br/>
find a couple of boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you're planning to come so we don't miss you.<br/>
<br/>
