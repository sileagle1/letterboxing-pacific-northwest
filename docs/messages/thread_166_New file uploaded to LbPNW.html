Awesome stamp, Funhog!  I never thought of that method of<br>
getting two different colors on one stamp.  The only way<br>
I have done it is to carve away all the areas to be colored<br>
and have the person stamping use black ink to put the outlines<br>
in their logbook, then use markers to color appropriately.<br>
By the way, I feel sorry for ya'll being snowed in, but it<br>
sounds pretty nice to me since we have been near 80 up until<br>
a few days ago.  No wonder ya'll are so creative up there!<br>

I've seen stamps that used four or five colors that way, although I <br>
have to admit I didn't much care for them much.  Looked too hokey.<br>
<br>
In other news, I created a "Stamping With Style" page you might be <br>
interested in--there are lots of way to get more than one color into <br>
a stamp, and the method Funhog used is only one of them.  Check it <br>
out at http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/Stamping<br>
<br>
Enjoy!  =)<br>
