                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife and I hunted for this box too - and came to the same conclusion as you regarding the changes made by the grounds keepers.  However, the planter of the box (Paisley Orca?) was down there after we were and found the box safe and sound in it's hiding place.  I haven't been back, but I plan to search the area again - after hours - so as not to draw the attention of the grounds keepers like we did last time :-(<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gosh...Maybe my paces are off.  Amanda and Ryan found this letterbox<br>
with no problem, but others seem to have a time of it.  Maybe I'll just<br>
have to make another trip over that way and check out the Maryhill<br>
Peacock again.  And also check out Horsethief Lake's letterbox - one of<br>
my personal favorites.  Any excuse to get my kayak on Horsethief Lake<br>
again, too,  - even though it can get pretty windy.  Sorry for the<br>
inconvenience for those of you having problems with the clues.  I<br>
thought they were pretty straightforward.  <br>
