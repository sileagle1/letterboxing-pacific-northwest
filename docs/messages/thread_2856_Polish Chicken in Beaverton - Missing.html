it on the letterbox.org site. Neither email address associated with <br/>
this box is working (both addresses are defunct). Someone should <br/>
probably pull the listing. Being a newbie, I have no idea how this <br/>
works.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I looked on letterboxing.org.  That box was placed by Cari, and is <br/>
the only one that was placed by her on LbNA and none on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
The parent directory for the special listing of that box has "geo" in <br/>
it and had geo coins for sale.<br/>
<br/>
That leads me to believe that she/they were geocachers who placed one <br/>
box 3 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Could any of our geocaching friends help us out on this?<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you know this person and could help mhcclass76 contact <br/>
them?  If there is a way to contact them, it would be great to have <br/>
them verify their own box and archive the clue.<br/>
<br/>
If there is no way to contact them and the box is definitely missing, <br/>
I would say to contact the webmaster of LbNA to either archive the <br/>
listing link or mark as probably missing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure webmaster Choi will help you with that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
