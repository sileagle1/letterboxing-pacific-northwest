                    <div class="plaintext-content">> I was wondering if anyone has ever thought of having a "how to<br>
> carve great stamps" event... I would be very interested in some<br>
> tutoring....<br>
<br>
There have been "tutoring sessions" at events and even if there's not <br>
a designated one, it's generally pretty easy to find someone at an <br>
event that will give you some pointers.<br>
<br>
I have a webpage for an online tutorial on carving at <br>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/Carving that you might find <br>
useful.  There's also links from it to other websites on how to carve <br>
stamps as well that are very useful.<br>
<br>
But I'd also like to mention, there's not necessarily one "right" way <br>
to carve a stamp.  What works for one person doesn't always work for <br>
another.  A little experience, practice and developing your own style <br>
will go a long way into carving your own fantastic stamps.  =)<br>
