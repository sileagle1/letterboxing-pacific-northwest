I'm a little late in writing this note, but two weeks ago Seahunter <br/>
(whose name will be changed to Grumpy Monkey pretty soon if he <br/>
doesn't shape up when letterboxing with me) and I took a trip to <br/>
Newport/Lincoln City and visited 3 boxes.  Here's an update:<br/>
<br/>
**Freddy at Tadpole's Birthday by the Hoppy Hunters is alive and <br/>
well.  It was a little damp inside, but the baggies kept everything <br/>
nice and dry.  This box hasn't been visited for a while (Sept 04).<br/>
<br/>
**Boiler Bay by the Lennen's 3 is alive and well but not recently <br/>
vistited either.  I just tried to look it up on letterboxing.org and <br/>
it isn't on there anymore, but the box is alive and well and ready to <br/>
be found!<br/>
<br/>
**Beneath the Blue #2 by Funhog has had a visit more recently and a <br/>
new log book added.  This box was full of water, but the baggies <br/>
protected everything inside.  I dried it out and tried to put it back <br/>
in its hidey-hole so it wouldn't get more water in it.  Hopefully it <br/>
worked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And a box a little closer to home:<br/>
<br/>
**Instant Gratification (new location) by Pupp &amp; Maiden1974.  Get out <br/>
there and get this box with its new holiday stamps...they are great!  <br/>
There are SIX new stamps in there that will only be there for a <br/>
month.  You will be really mad at yourself if you miss these great <br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I've had my nose buried in a book for a while, but I hope to see a <br/>
lot of you at the gathering next weekend!  I've missed all my <br/>
letterboxing buddies!<br/>

WOW&lt; thanks for the update, I had gotten a report that this was <br/>
totally gone last summer so I deleted the clues, I will put some <br/>
sort of clues back up for it, and it will be ready to find again!!!  <br/>
Going to the beach the last weekend of March so I will be able to <br/>
check it and update it!!! Thanks so much bookworm!!<br/>
