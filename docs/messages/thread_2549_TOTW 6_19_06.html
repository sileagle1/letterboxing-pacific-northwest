<br/>
That's a great TOTW.<br/>
<br/>
I do the same -- explain it as treasure hunting.  Sometimes people <br/>
will recognize it as geocaching, and I don't disabuse them of that <br/>
notion.  Too difficult to explain the differences.  Geocaching seems <br/>
to be more well-understood, a little more main-stream.<br/>

Good one, Colls! I try to select my quarry carefully...find someone <br/>
who seems playful and interested in many different things. Much less <br/>
likely to glaze over! Also, if they laugh at my corny jokes...<br/>
