If you haven't gotten this box yet, I highly recommend it. <br/>

We just had the most wonderful time! The snow has stopped and most had<br/>
melted around our house so I loaded up the kids and hubby and went in<br/>
search of Paisley Orca's Beaver Creek box.  I was thrilled to find it<br/>
safe and sound exactly where the clues said it would be.  The hike down<br/>
was a bit treacherous due to the area being pretty heavy with snow and<br/>
ice still, but it was a definite adventure.  My 6 year old and 4 year<br/>
old made it with no problem and we got stamped in.  It was fun to see<br/>
that the last person to log in was a park ranger with very nice<br/>
comments. <br/>
