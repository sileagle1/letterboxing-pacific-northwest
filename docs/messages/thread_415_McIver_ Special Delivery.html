This stamp was created by Brett to commemorate the imminent birth of<br>
his and Penny's second child. Not knowing if Grace's new sibling would<br>
insist on arriving before, during or after the Rubberstamp Campout, he<br>
entrusted me with his stamp and the honor of creating this very<br>
special letterbox. <br>
<br>
Head east from camp until you might be inclined to spike and serve.<br>
Standing in the middle between two upright citizens, set your compass<br>
for 125 degrees magnetic and walk 108 steps to a shady character.<br>
Reset that compass for 80 degrees and walk until you reach the open<br>
arms of a verdant friend. There's a place in its heart for this little<br>
bundle of joy.<br>
<br>
				Congratulations!	Funhog										<br>
