                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fluttered about the state today checking on various letterboxes.  <br>
Just wanted to note that the following letterboxes are alive & well <br>
(or assistance rendered to) as of 1 Jun 04:<br>
<br>
Tumuli (was M*ima Mounds), replanted, revised clues<br>
Chamber of Secrets-alive & well<br>
New Market Falls-alive & well<br>
Olympia Brewhaus-alive & well<br>
Olympia Beer-poor shape, I took the liberty to retire the old log & <br>
deteriorating stamp, recarved a new one, created a new log & will <br>
send the originals home to Silver Eagle--same clues, same hiding <br>
spot, now contains a very similar stamp<br>
It's Raining Animals-alive & well, slightly revised clues to #1<br>
Mushroom & Fern-alive & well (despite frequent missing reports)<br>
Spectacles-alive & well but totally out in the open--somebody <br>
accidentally stumbled upon it today, signed in and said they were <br>
going to look into letterboxing but left the entire box visible to <br>
ALL passersby, we carefully tucked it back into its nook and it <br>
continues to live on<br>
Sisters' Pagoda-alive & well & heavily visited--who knew?<br>
Lion of Lion's Park-alive & well<br>
<br>
no luck with Memories<br>
no luck with 2 others at Tum Hist Park<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, forgot to mention yesterday that we put the Heath Farm LB back <br>
into play--clues have changed slightly to it but it's back, better <br>
than ever!  As clues to Weepy Clown #4 are dependent upon this LB, <br>
the clues to the original hiding spot are still required to find the <br>
clown.  Not sure how to deal with this.<br>
<br>
dvn2r ckr<br>
<br>
Not bad, found 14 letterboxes in one day & NARY a find added toward <br>
my PFX count.  :(  Did get to add a geocache to my count, though, <br>
and a nifty pencil sharpener, to boot.  ;)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We'll revise 'Where are the Clowns' #4 as soon as we can locate the new Heath Farms box. We're just recently moved #2 <br>
as a homeless person had taken up residence in the near vicinity.  We also suspect that #3 is missing, Rayvenmom went <br>
out Monday afternoon to look for it again and we believe that we found the log (Which is buried in heavy undergrowth) <br>
but nary a sight of the box itself.  If so, we'll rearer/replant after consulting with Canada Goose. Will try to get <br>
out there this weekend to do so dvn2r ckr.  Thanks so much for replanting it!!!<br>
<br>
Besides, we need to go out and continue to look for our nemesis, the infamous Pirates Treasure!  This will make try <br>
#8.  (chuckles) I guess we're not pirates at heart!  Not yet anyways!<br>
