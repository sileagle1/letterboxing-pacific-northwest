who is currently doing a through hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.  He <br>
should be in the area in about 2 or 3 weeks, last I head from him.<br>

 The Meadow<br>
Placed by Hoopoe <br>
Place:  Sheep Lake, Chinook Pass, Yakima County WA<br>
Nearest town: Greenwater PIERCE  county.  This box is right on the <br>
county line.<br>
Distance, about 3 - 4 miles round trip.  Allow plenty of time to <br>
stop, look and enjoy the sights.<br>
<br>
Hike:  A fairly kind, steady hike with moderate gain.  In some places <br>
the trail requires careful steps.  Small children can make this trip <br>
but should be well supervised due to steep edges on parts of the <br>
trail and the wilderness nature of the whole area.<br>
<br>
Take water and a lunch. Prepare for stunning vistas, wildflowers ( <br>
late July is best time), busy chipmunks, birds, bugs and <br>
butterflies.  Wonderful warm woodland smells.  <br>
<br>
This area is subject ot heavy snowfall and the box will only be <br>
accessible during the thaw, a variable mid-May through early <br>
October.  Check on current road access reports for snow closure and <br>
unexpected closures, such as the forest fire that closed the road <br>
south from the pass the day I placed this box.<br>
