irritates you...but come to the party anyway!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Wooo HOOOOOO!!!<br/>
<br/>
We have over 60 people signed up to go so far!  It's not too late to <br/>
sign up if you want to come...the more the merrier!  <br/>
<br/>
Please see the AQ Event board under Spring Flinger to see the link <br/>
for the park...there you can get the address and see some pictures of <br/>
what's in store.  <br/>
<br/>
Also....<br/>
We need some drinks still!  (canned pop and bottled water)  Look at <br/>
the list to see what everyone is bringing for the BAKED POTATO <br/>
POTLUCK and see what's left.  And some packaged cookies to if you are <br/>
so inclined.  Just let me know and I'll add it to the list!<br/>
<br/>
We have at least one event stamp so far (and it's a big one!  be <br/>
prepared!) plus a ton of personal travelers.  Rumor has it that we <br/>
all just might get infested with cooties too!  I am so looking <br/>
forward to meeting you all, and I'm sure a good chunk of time will be <br/>
spent just introducing ourselves, exchanging sig stamps and catching <br/>
up with old friends.  <br/>
<br/>
Have a great week everybody ~ Elisabeth<br/>
