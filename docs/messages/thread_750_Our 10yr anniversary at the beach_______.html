I carved a new sign in stamp for just us and headed out with high <br>
hopes of finding many boxes.<br>
    We started with Devils Lake but were unable to locate it. We <br>
thought we were in the right place but we could have been wrong.<br>
    We then headed to We Love Lincoln City which was probably our <br>
easiest find since we started letterboxing and being 8 months <br>
pregnant I needed that about now. Very hard to be discreet though but <br>
we did a good job. When we found it we could see it even before we <br>
got to close so we hide it better from the crowds by placing it it in <br>
a little farther.<br>
   On we went to Boiler Bay. Again a success. We are liking these <br>
cause of the ease of the find but this one was even harder to be <br>
discreet. We were happy that the kids weren't with us since they make <br>
it almost impossible to be very discreet.<br>
   Then off we went to Devils Punch Bowl and were finally rewarded <br>
with Paisley Orca's creation. It's alive and well.<br>
   We then went to Beneath the Blue # 2 at Beverely Beach. We looked <br>
and looked and finally gave up. We later remembered some extra clues <br>
we had gotten and went back later and had success. This makes 2 out <br>
of the 4 of this series for us. Thank you Funhog.<br>
   We kept going and ended up at the Yaquina Bay Lighthouse. We <br>
searched and search and could not find this on. We are almost certain <br>
we were in the right spot on this on.<br>
  We then decided to call it a day cause I was starting to feel a lot <br>
of baby activity and I didn't want the baby at the beach.<br>
  Then on the way home we decided to see if we could find the Van <br>
Duzer Corridor one. Unfortunatly we came up empty handed on that one <br>
too. We again are pretty sure we were in the right spot. Paisley Orca <br>
if you would like to know if this one and the lighthouse one might <br>
just have been missed by us or if they are gone please e-mail me <br>
blancoandyou@yahoo.com and we will describe were we thought it was. I <br>
hope they aren't cause we like your stamps.<br>
  Sorry it got lengthy....I love hearing how people have done and I <br>
hope there are those of you that do too. We are so happy we found <br>
this sport and are always excited to hear the news of how it is going <br>
with everyone. Thanks again for all those that place boxes. We hope <br>
to do that next summer.<br>
