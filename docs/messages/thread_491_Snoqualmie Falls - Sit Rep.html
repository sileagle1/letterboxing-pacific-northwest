I was just out there on 7/29 to do a mini-run up-n-down that 1/2 mile <br/>
trail - - hey! did someone say "idiot".<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, if any of you haven't been on that short, awesome trail then it <br/>
is a must do. Just don't plan on running/jogging it. wow-what was I <br/>
thinking.!?...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - on 7/29 it was alive and well. It was rehid just fine, just <br/>
not in the exact spot I had placed it. (only less than a foot from <br/>
where I placed it)....<br/>
<br/>
Happy Adventures<br/>
