That info is probably completely useless to you, but I do know that it <br/>

If we did make that hike then we could visit Dumbledore at his secret <br/>
hideaway.(Hint for all those Southern Oregon boxers)<br/>
The closest thing to a week long hike for us is either pulling our <br/>
trailer down the highway or doing the Rogue on our raft.<br/>
<br/>
Now regarding the inside joke about when to show up, you do have to <br/>
admit Gwen and I are pretty fast on throwing some great chow together.<br/>
<br/>
 Someday you will find out what happens when one gets into retirement <br/>
mode, you have no clue what day it is.<br/>

up on the wrong day!<br/>

Yep, cuz if you showed up on the right day, it might have been <br/>
leftovers. Wait a minute, it was the right day...wasn't it?<br/>
