That info is probably completely useless to you, but I do know that it <br>

If we did make that hike then we could visit Dumbledore at his secret <br>
hideaway.(Hint for all those Southern Oregon boxers)<br>
The closest thing to a week long hike for us is either pulling our <br>
trailer down the highway or doing the Rogue on our raft.<br>
<br>
Now regarding the inside joke about when to show up, you do have to <br>
admit Gwen and I are pretty fast on throwing some great chow together.<br>

 Someday you will find out what happens when one gets into retirement <br>
mode, you have no clue what day it is.<br>
