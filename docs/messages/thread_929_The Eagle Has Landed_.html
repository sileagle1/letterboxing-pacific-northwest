                    <div class="plaintext-content">Even though I flew in last Sunday (with help from an airplane),<br/>
I have not had a chance to post my activities until now, so<br/>
here goes.  Sunday I had to drive to Ft. Canby because I wanted<br/>
to place my Lewis &amp; Clark In WA box there and I intended to <br/>
letterbox along the way.  I did manage to find the two Claquato<br/>
boxes and the Rainbow Falls one, but darkness defeated any other<br/>
endeavers.  In fact, I had to hide my box in darkness with the<br/>
threat of being locked in the park if they closed the gates.<br/>
Luckily there were lights along the path that I hid it on so<br/>
it was not too bad, but was not able to hide it as well as I<br/>
wanted.  I then drove on to Portland so I could letterbox the<br/>
Columbia River Gorge the next day and hide my Lewis &amp; Clark In OR<br/>
box there.  I just have to say that even though it rained on me<br/>
all day, the Gorge is just beautiful and the hikes and letterboxes<br/>
are great!  I even found the Multnomah Letterbox!  I reluctantly<br/>
left the Gorge to do some letterboxing in Portland because I <br/>
wanted to get another of Funhog's 3 Portland boxes (Sleight).  I <br/>
already have one (Portland, TX), but alas, I was not able to find <br/>
this one.  I did find a few others but it was soon time to start <br/>
heading back to Olympia for the Silver Eagle Oyster Exchange <br/>
Event graciously organized by DVN2RCKR.  I did manage to squeeze<br/>
in the Happy Postman Series in Lewisville Park just before dark,<br/>
though it made me a little late to the event.  This was my first<br/>
event and first time Exchanging with people I did not know and<br/>
I must say I was very impressed with the whole experience.  <br/>
Everyone was very nice and easy to talk to and the food was great!<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who showed up, especially on such short<br/>
notice.  The next day I had to be in Seattle for my conference <br/>
that would start in the afternoon, so I was up early again to get<br/>
in as much letterboxing as I could (I was up by 5:30 each day<br/>
so I could be at the letterbox destination at dawn).  I planned<br/>
to place my Olympia Beer letterbox (first in my Beer Series) at<br/>
Tumwater Falls Park, but when I got there the gates were closed <br/>
and would not open until 8:00.  I decided to drive down to the<br/>
Tumwater Historical Park and find the Water, Water Everywhere <br/>
box (and bonus) and ended up placing my box there.  Instead of<br/>
waiting for the other park to open, I decided to go on to the<br/>
Wonderwood Park in Lacey and I'm glad I did.  I really enjoyed<br/>
that park (it helped that it was the first day without rain) and<br/>
found a lot of boxes while trekking all over the place.  I did<br/>
not plan on spending that much time there but with all the boxes, <br/>
beautiful scenery and cool weather (I'm tired of mid-80s), I<br/>
ended up spending almost 3 hours there.  This left little time<br/>
for my next stop at Ft. Steilacoom Park, but I did manage to find<br/>
the Fledgling, SSLF and Where Are The Clowns boxes.  I briefly<br/>
looked for DVN2RCKR's Insane Asylum box but could not find it, <br/>
even though I know she just replaced it.  There were many others<br/>
I just did not have time to look for since it was time to head to<br/>
Seattle.  Today was the first day I did no letterboxing and doesn't<br/>
it just figure that it was beautiful outside!  I did sneak out<br/>
to place my Klondike Gold Rush box and walk through Pioneer Square<br/>
and Pike Market.  I must say, I really enjoyed this area and I<br/>
don't normally like being downtown in big cities.  In fact, I<br/>
have loved every place I have visited so far and envy all of you<br/>
for your multitude of scenic places to visit.  I hope to sneak<br/>
out again tomorrow and maybe Friday, and of course I hope to see<br/>
some more of you this Saturday at Wapato Park before I have to <br/>
leave.  Sorry for the long post but I just wanted to share how<br/>
much I appreciate being here.  Hope to see you Saturday!<br/>

Yes, I still can't get used to having so many available<br/>
letterboxes within such realtively short drives.  I'm<br/>
used to driving over 100 miles for 1 or 2 boxes.<br/>
By the way, loved your Dancing At Bougival stamp!<br/>
