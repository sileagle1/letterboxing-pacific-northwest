                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just completed a 3200+ mile road trip from Denver, CO to OR area to <br/>
visit family for Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say THANKS! to placers of boxes on the north coast, <br/>
Colombia Gorge, and Portland areas in particular - but also ID, WA <br/>
and MT (I know there's some crossover with the Rocky Mtn talk list <br/>
where I usually hang out....)  I've tried to contact placers of <br/>
boxes I found in your area privately, but since I had Mile High <br/>
Hopes of "bagging" many more boxes than I had time for while in the <br/>
area I wanted to thank you ALL for your efforts.  I'm in awe of how <br/>
many boxes there are in your area!<br/>
<br/>
I THINK I might have been successful in making some more  <br/>
addicts....I mean boxers....My bro, sis in law, and 18 month nephew <br/>
helped me with a few boxes for a true group effort. <hehe><br/>
<br/>
So many rocks, so little time!  I did the trip in 2 weeks, but could <br/>
easily have used 2 MONTHS for all the boxing I wanted to do...<br/>
<br/>
Hope ya'll can make it to the Rocky Mountain area for a road trip <br/>
real soon.<br/>
<br/>
Yours in Boxing,<br/>
