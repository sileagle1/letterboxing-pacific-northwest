when he has too much work to handle himself, and thought I'd mention that <br/>
colors and styles are not an all-or-nothing deal.  We often get orders that <br/>
have 5 of this color short sleeve, 10 of that color long, etc, and it makes <br/>
no difference in the ultimate price as long as you order the minimum the <br/>
printer needs to make it cost-effective.  Often folks choose ink colors that <br/>
work well for most shirts, with an ink color change if the scheme chosen <br/>
won't work for a particular color.  Then, you just pay another set-up fee <br/>
for those ink colors.<br/>
<br/>
Something to think about.<br/>
