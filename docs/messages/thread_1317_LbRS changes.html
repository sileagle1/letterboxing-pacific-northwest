                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've made some changes to the LbRS as detailed below:<br/>
<br/>
Due to the sheer number of requests, Pet friendly has been returned to Dog friendly as this more accurately covers <br/>
what we are looking for here. I mean, no one's ever complained about a pet cat running down the trail and jumping up <br/>
on someone slobbering all over them. Nor has anyone complained about someone's pet lizard barreling down the trail, <br/>
though, I'll tell you what, if I saw someone's pet Iguana barreling down the trail at me, I'd be hard pressed to not <br/>
stand there in shock, completely amazed. Besides, the signs we see at a park show a Dog on a leash, not a cat or a <br/>
lizard.<br/>
<br/>
Also, due to overwhelming requests for these additions, I've added the following additional ratings. 'P' for Parking <br/>
Fees, 'E' for Special Equipment and 'TED' for Total Estimated Distance.  The new P and E ratings are now placed at the <br/>
end of the current string and the TED is combined into the current T or Trail rating to give a combined score.  The <br/>
TED ratings are:<br/>
<br/>
0 = Unknown, 1 = 0 to 1/4 mile, 2 = 1/4 to 1/2 mile, 3 = 1/2 to 1 mile, 4 = 1 to 2 miles, 5 = Over 2 miles <br/>
<br/>
So the new ratings would look like this:  'T2-2' which would mean an Easy trail with a Total Estimated Distance of <br/>
between 1/4 to 1/2 mile.<br/>
<br/>
Parking fees is a simple Yes/No question. If the spot you start someone out from requires them to pay parking should <br/>
the park there, then a yes is a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Special equipment is as well also. If any special equipment is required, other than the normal day hike items, then <br/>
select Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to keep your current ratings if you want to, the old style will not break the decoder, it decodes both new <br/>
and old formats as well.  If you want to update your current ratings on your letterboxes, feel free to do so.<br/>
<br/>
As far the request to include the rating for "NDQ" (Nearest Dairy Queen) and "NBH" (Nearest Brew House), I'm sorry, <br/>
but I believe that extra curricular activities are something for each person to experience on their own, in their own <br/>
way! ;-)<br/>
