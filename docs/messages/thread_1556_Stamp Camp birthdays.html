Hey Charlie -- I am so glad you were able to come to the event - and I just<br>
wanted to reiterate a little of what you said... and fix a little typo you<br>
made. Happy 60TH Birthday Charlie!! Can't wait to see you again... and we'll<br>
try to find a different hat next time.<br>

<br>
A major thank you to Camp Fire Lady, Pandora, Maiden and Bookworm for<br>
putting together the wonderful Passport to Letterboxing gathering at<br>
beautiful Battle Ground Lake. I really had a good time meeting new<br>
people, attending two expertly presented and planned seminars,<br>
collecting bunches of stamps and finding lots of letterboxes. It was<br>
very fortunate that the excitement we had Saturday evening had a happy<br>
ending and those who received the "walk" stamp certainly deserved it.<br>
And what a joy to meet the famous "DER Mad Stamper". Thank you all<br>
for helping Pandora celebrate her 28th and my 30th birthday, it was a<br>
lot of fun! Oh, and while I always appreciate getting a new hat to<br>
wear there are some designs I appreciate more than others. Well done<br>
guys! Lets do it again! <br>
