                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok so first of all...I think Yahoo Groups was on Crack the last time <br/>
I posted.  April Fooling Around aside, I did not! deliberately post <br/>
twelvety-hundred-times on purpose.  Holy Garlic Breath!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say a Huge Mile High Thanks to EVERYONE for coming <br/>
out to Laurelwood on Tuesday.  I was truly and completely <br/>
overwhelmed by the mondo-sized welcome mat ya'll put out!  I'm <br/>
rarely at a loss for words, but well...words fail me once in a <br/>
while.. and this is one of those times.<br/>
<br/>
Extra special thanks go to marmalade for carving some very special <br/>
April Foolish stamps for us all to enjoy - which personally I'll <br/>
treasure forever since I collect all things related to Fools Day, to <br/>
funhog for placing a 'box for the occaison for us all to find and <br/>
for catching an earlier flight to join us, to GT and Amanda for <br/>
wandering by on their way north from "other" Foolishness - I'm sorry <br/>
I didn't get to chat with you more, to the Cootie Crew for working <br/>
overtime (I'd only ever "met" one cootie before and well..good lawd <br/>
those things are like bunny rabbits!) and to ALL of you for being <br/>
there, sharing your stories, stamps and your WONDERFUL amazing <br/>
selves for the evening!<br/>
<br/>
The meet was the 'boxing highlight of the trip for me.  There were <br/>
many on the family front, but one I thought I'd share with you: <br/>
<br/>
The next morning after our meet I was awakened by the Party Penguin <br/>
who says "oink, oink, oink" and puts his hands under his arms while <br/>
wandering around the house rocking happily back and forth...a bit <br/>
like one of the ways to spot a letterboxer!  I've been "into" <br/>
penguins long before the recent movie stuff.  The Party Penguin who <br/>
says "oink, oink, oink" in the form of my adorable 3-year old nephew <br/>
made sure I wouldn't miss my flight.<br/>
<br/>
I smiled happy thoughts as I waddled my way to the Max station the <br/>
next morning with my pack on my back and my explorer hat on my head <br/>
saying "oink, oink, oink" thinking to myself: Yep, Portland was the <br/>
perfect! place to spend April Fools week 2007.  And Fools really <br/>
don't care how "that" might look to "other" people...<br/>
<br/>
Left 3 PREsents behind for ya'll to find (a few already have found <br/>
one) to show my apPREciation for a terrifically memorable week.  <br/>
Two 'boxes have clues up already with one more set of clues I still <br/>
need to type up.<br/>
