  Congratulations to you, mama & big sister (Grace, right?)!  When Hallie was <br>
tiny and yowling at 3 AM, I remember thinking I was linked to all the other <br>
parents out there somewhere in the night, sleepy and taking care of a baby.  I <br>
hope Robert gives you some good solid sleeping time!<br>
