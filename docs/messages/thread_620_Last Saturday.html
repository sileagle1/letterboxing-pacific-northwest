As Carie of Lennens 3 reported, we went out Saturday and had a nice fun<br/>
day of letterboxing.  There was some frustration (as is usually the case<br/>
when my inept butt is involved in the letterboxing process).  Doyle Owl<br/>
was indeed elusive, as was one of the Mom, Mexico and Me boxes.  At<br/>
least the first one we tried for.  <br/>
<br/>
We were successful with one mystery LB, Spiney and 2nd Annual<br/>
Thanksgiving LB's.  It was a beautiful day.  We are now trying to figure<br/>
out Ace of Fun. UGH!   Everyone who has this one can go na na na na na<br/>
cuz we are stumped.  We think we may have some idea, but not sure if<br/>
we're on the right track.  Any friendly comments from a helpful Hog<br/>
would be most appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
