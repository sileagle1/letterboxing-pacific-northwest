finding Bookworms Unite, a box I placed in an urban area, very easily <br/>
accessible, three weeks ago.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I went and got this box today at lunch.  What fun clues and a very <br/>
nifty box!  I love clues that you can't figure out until you are <br/>
there.  I was the second person to stamp into this box (last one was <br/>
Sept 6).  It was hidden very well, and I made sure to hide it better <br/>
than I found it.  I'm very proud to have this wonderful Bookworm stamp <br/>
in Bookworm's log book. (Hee hee.  Uh, oh, too much sun. I'm getting <br/>
silly now!)<br/>
<br/>
Best of all, I used my brand-new signature stamp in this box for the <br/>
first time.  It seemed fitting that my new stamp should get stamped <br/>
into this box first.  My buddy Maiden was kind enough to take time out <br/>
of her busy schedule and carve it for me.  I will be debuting it at the <br/>
Joker's Wild Letterboxing Poker Run Gathering on October 1st.  So stop <br/>
by and see me if you'd like to have it in your book.  I'm happy to show <br/>
it off.  You might want to ask me about any books I've read lately, <br/>
too.  :-)<br/>

I definitely will ask you, always interested in good books, and<br/>
sometimes when I ask questions I get special things as a result, hmmm?<br/>
And you're right, yours of all stamps is the most appropriate for this<br/>
particular box.  I'm so honored you chose this box to break it in; I<br/>
will now stop stewing about no one visiting!  Looking forward to<br/>
meeting you at Oxbow.<br/>
