  Cat's Meow, Lazyboy and I am off to the Passport to Letterboxing <br/>
Stamp Camp also this fine morning and it will be a beautiful weekend <br/>
for an event! I too have a personal traveler that was created when I <br/>
was a member of the "big" list and there were a few flame wars <br/>
happening. If you can show me the universal hand sign for "Peace", I <br/>
will gladly give it to you. Cat's Meow has also carved her own <br/>
personal traveler. If you can go up to Cat's Meow at the event and <br/>
make the sound that a cat would make when it sleeps, she will gladly <br/>
present her stamp to you. Looking forward to meeting some new <br/>
letterboxers and seeing some of my old friends as well!<br/>

at Stamp Camp. We both have personal stamps that can be had to the <br/>
asking. Jenn also has a birthday stamp for anyone who's had a <br/>
birthday recently and asks for it. In addition, if you ask Jenn what <br/>
youth organization she supports, she has another stamp. Our dogs, <br/>
Jett and Tank, also have stamps which can be had for some loving (ear <br/>
scritch, hug, belly rub, etc). Jett the therapy dog also has another <br/>
stamp that can be had for a list of ten things that help you maintain <br/>
positive mental health. Kids can have the stamp for a list of ten <br/>
things to do when you're angry that doesn't hurt you or others. I'm <br/>
carving mine today. You can prolly have it just by asking for it and <br/>
being nice to me. (I'm easy).<br/>

nicely.  I'm more elusive than bigfoot, but quite agreeable when <br/>

<br/>
Two additional stamp imprints can be obtained by telling me the names <br/>
of (1) the first two letterboxes in Oregon, and (2) the first <br/>
letterboxes in both Kansas and Nebraska.  I can't wait to meet you <br/>
all!<br/>
