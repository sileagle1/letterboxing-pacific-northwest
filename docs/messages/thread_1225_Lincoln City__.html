Just got back from a trip to the beach....only got a bit of Lbing <br>
done.  After our 2nd try for the Beneath The Blue #2 I am ecstatic <br>
to report that we found it!!!!!!  What a beautiful walk through the <br>
forest!  Our plans to get Fogarty Creek and Roads End were <br>
unsuccessful due to a sprained ankle of yours truly, one walk was <br>
all this girl could do this time!!!!  Ankle Healing, out again <br>
soon!  <br>
<br>
We also stopped to get Spruce Goose on the way to the beach, cute <br>
little park and we ran into a gentlemen who wanted to tell us his <br>
whole life story.....what can you do but smile and listen!!!!<br>
<br>
Talk soon,<br>

Carie, I think you need the Letterboxing Order of the Purple Heart <br>
Postal Letterbox for injuries sustained in the line of letterboxing!<br>
<br>
Send me your address off list and I'll pop it in the mail for you.<br>

Oh thanks for the great laugh!!!!  My hubby laughs at me...says that <br>
if I had to work with a sprained ankle, I would stay home and off my <br>
foot, but when it comes to boxing, I will suffer through!!!!!  Oh he <br>
is on to me!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

I actually was serious.  I am the last person on the Letterboxing <br>
Order of the Purple Heart postal letterbox, so I can give it to the <br>
next person injured in the line of letterboxing that I hear about.  <br>
If you want it, let me know and I'll send it your way.  I'd love to <br>
move this guy along (the stories in it are good reading!).<br>
