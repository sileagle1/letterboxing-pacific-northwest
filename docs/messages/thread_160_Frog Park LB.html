We found it!  Great clues and great hiding spot!  Didn't see any tadpoles, <br>
but we did see a huge family of ducks! :-)<br>

Hi Leenie!<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'm kinda hoping the tadpoles/frogs got wiped out--if they really are <br>
(the evil) bullfrogs.  Make room for Pacific treefrogs or red-legs to move <br>
in, without immediately  becoming bait for the big brutes.   <br>
<br>
I saw what was probably that same duck family--maybe 12 or 13 puffballs <br>
swimming giddily after their parents.  I'll have to go back just to check how <br>
they're grown--and how many of them have survived thus far...  <br>
<br>
Heather will be thrilled that someone other than me found her first box!<br>
