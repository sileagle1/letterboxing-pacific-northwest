Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
While boxing this weekend we found several boxes just thrown back together<br/>
and not even put back...just left out in the open. I know that there are many good<br/>
people on this site and in the Letterboxing community and it is probably just a<br/>
few that are doing this. Lets be sure to take care of these gifts that we all have<br/>
worked so hard at carving, hiding and writing clues. Also be sure to rmind the<br/>
new comers to do the same. While I won't mention any names, ( and it wasn't a <br/>
stamp tha tI was familiar with) we did notice that  all the boxes had the same stamp<br/>
posted last in each box we found. <br/>
<br/>
Please lets be careful with those boxes!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Oh you are so nice... what are you thinking. You need to cause some trouble<br/>
like the rest of us around here... tell us who it was, accidentally send an<br/>
email to the list that should be sent privately or say something that we can<br/>
all get in an argument amount :) Stop leaving all the dirty work up to the<br/>
rest of us by being such a nice guy.<br/>

WoW, is this what it has come to???  We have to add a disclaimer <br/>
when we are being humorous??!!!  Cover all the bases I guess!!!  <br/>
Can't be too safe around here!!!<br/>
<br/>
Back to the boxes in question, the last stamper in the series did <br/>
not sign a name just stamped in, so although my brother is a nice <br/>
guy indeed, we really didn't see a name to put to the messed up <br/>
boxes!!!!!  And if we did would we add a name???......  I may, but <br/>
my brother, well he is just nice!!!!!<br/>
