<br>
Today after work stopped by fain's legion, see what was going on.  The bat is there!!!!!  The Gator is there!!!  Hippo 2 is there, and have another firstie!!!  However, The Turtle was not found :-(  Don't know if it might have been dvn2r ckr's nemesis, as the others were in fine shape.  Been there twice before, searched the area for any signs, none found.  Also the clues for strgzrmomma's new raining animal were not there; looked around but didn't spot it anywhere.<br>
<br>
Yesterday had time before a meeting so went down to Pioneer Cemetery, and found Tom Riddle's Dairy, snug in its spot.  Another Firstie!  Nice Stamp!  Wandered around the cemetery, lots of pioneers there, very interesting.<br>
<br>
Last Monday, stopped by the Capitol on the way home, was almost dark, went on a moon walk.  Moon was not found, didn't see the pump run in the hole.  Earth was 'behind a cloud', didn't grab it, but stood around for a while with my arm in the tree, looking foolish (fortunatley the State Patrolmen were on dinner break :-).  Did find the third, the Capitol.  Found my favorite HH again!  I recall NailHead's message claiming firsties, and beating dvn2r ckr and her cohorts.  They were there later, but cleverly fit their stamps on the first page, right in front of the 7Nails page :-)  NailHead, you just can't every best dvn2r ckr.<br>

Several Sunday's ago, located Hedwig's Journal, in the dark.  Work with people in the last building you walk around, so took a shortcut.  Very nice!<br>
<br>
Late last and early this month nabbed the NailKids tribute to NailHead.  Got two before it got too dark and they locked the gates (or so the sign said), second time got the other two and the Goldfish.  Nice walk, nice kids!<br>
