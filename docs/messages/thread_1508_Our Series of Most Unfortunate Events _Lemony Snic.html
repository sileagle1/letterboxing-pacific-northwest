                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Fellow Letterboxers ,<br/>
<br/>
This is a tale of misery, and bad luck, if you are looking for <br/>
someone to share their happy letterboxing experiences, stop reading <br/>
now, do not read any farther, because the this clue will fill you <br/>
with despair, this is your last chance, despair begins at the very <br/>
next sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Those poor Baudelaire orphans! We tried to rescue them, tried, <br/>
meaning of course, that we failed, but failed attempting to do it <br/>
and not sitting on the couch at home watching T.V. and scarfing down <br/>
cheetos. <br/>
<br/>
When we tried to leave Oregon for California, it seemed were plagued <br/>
with the bad luck and misery of Sunny, Violet and Klause.  First the <br/>
car broken down at the bottle of the hill, bottom at this point <br/>
meaning the lowest part of a very large and miserable hill one must <br/>
climb in order to get to the top.  Pandora was stranded.  A quick <br/>
call to the Mechanic sent someone out to figure out what the problem <br/>
was, a dead battery, no big deal, oh how wrong, the misery, agony <br/>
and unpleasantness of trying to find a battery at 7:00pm on a Sunday <br/>
night was about has bad has hiking through overgrown paths in Oregon <br/>
where little bugs bite you merely to suck the blood out of you! When <br/>
fixing this dilemma in our journey we were informed by the Mechanic <br/>
who I am sure broke it on his own in an attempt to aid Count Olaf, <br/>
that the alternator on the car was shot, shot meaning of course, not <br/>
working at all.  So an overnight delay and the time it took to get <br/>
that replaced in the morning set us way behind on our mission to <br/>
rescue the miserable orphans. Once that problem was fix the <br/>
following morning it appeared that the orphans bad luck and misery <br/>
had worn off on us a bit, because when driving home to finally get <br/>
on our way, we discovered that we could not tell what time it was or <br/>
listen to music, which would surely make this trip even more <br/>
miserable than we had imagined.  In investigating this problem we <br/>
discovered that the car radio had put itself in theft lock mode when <br/>
the battery died, and now required a secret code to unlock it.  <br/>
Required meaning of course that it was absolutely necessary, and <br/>
secret meaning of course that only the person that originally owned <br/>
the car had it.  So delayed again, we headed to car toys to have the <br/>
stereo replaced with one that would work, work from hear forward <br/>
meaning it would play music that pandora could sing to in order to <br/>
make the trip full of even more misery and agony for Iron`Bear who <br/>
would have to listen.  We were finally on our way, headed, though <br/>
terribly delayed, to California to rescue the orphans.  If there is <br/>
a silver liningmeaning, of course, a sliver of hope that something <br/>
good has come from such tragedy, it is that the $500 it took to get <br/>
everything fix saved us from the car getting broken down in the <br/>
miserable, hot area between Oregon and California where we would <br/>
have been stranded on the side of the road and 50 miles out of any <br/>
town.<br/>
<br/>
We finally arrived in California to find that there was a mistake in <br/>
our hotel reservations that left us searching for a new hotel at <br/>
2:30am  yet another most unpleasant experience.  But we finally got <br/>
settled and slept, ready to wake up in the morning and finally <br/>
attempt to rescue the poor orphans.  Sure enough we found the <br/>
location where the orphans had been hiding, but much to our despair, <br/>
no sooner had we found it than we saw Count Olaf himself breeze past <br/>
us with the orphans in tow.  We were too late! Ahhh the misery and <br/>
unpleasantness, the despair and broken heartedness we suffered was <br/>
too much, too much meaning that neither of us could really handle <br/>
it.  But it seemed there was a little ray of hope a note from <br/>
Lemony Snicket in the back of the log book giving us a time and <br/>
place to find more information about the orphans.  We rushed back to <br/>
the car and headed straight to Kinko's where they charge you and arm <br/>
and a leg to use their computers, in a hope to figure out where <br/>
Lemony Snicket wanted us to go.  But alas, we could not decipher his <br/>
directions.  <br/>
<br/>
We gave up for the day, filled with unpleasantness, and headed back <br/>
to our room to clean up and have dinner with some local letter <br/>
boxers. After that we visited family, which trust me fellow letter <br/>
boxers, makes the whole adventure yet even more unpleasant.  <br/>
<br/>
The next morning we decided to go back to the location that the <br/>
orphans had been at and take a picture of Lemony Snicket's letter in <br/>
case it actually was a clue, and perhaps something we could un-<br/>
riddle and figure out another time.  After grabbing a photo of the <br/>
note, we decided to hit some much more happy and pleasant <br/>
letterboxes and put an end to this series of unfortunate events that <br/>
had befallen us on our quest for such an unhappy letterbox as the <br/>
one planted by Lemony Snicket.  <br/>
<br/>
We hit several boxes in the area and finally found ourselves at a <br/>
box in Oroville California.  We grabbed the box quickly in an effort <br/>
to go expose ourselves to more misery by visiting family again.  We <br/>
stamped in on a near by picnic table and then I rushed off to <br/>
utilize a most unpleasant port-a-potty.  Iron`Bear re-hid the box <br/>
and off we went.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning we had one last box to grab in Yuba City, before <br/>
hitting the I-5 and heading home, nabbing a few boxes along the <br/>
way.  We got to the park and I got out and started looking for the <br/>
box, Iron`Bear was at the car getting the stuff. But he starts <br/>
hollering to me, "pandora where is the book and stamp?"  "You had <br/>
it last," I informed him.  After a few more minutes of him looking I <br/>
walk over and he says, "I can't find it." That is when the worst of <br/>
it all began. My heart sank to my knees; I felt a lump in my throat <br/>
as I asked him. "When I rushed off to the bathroom last night and <br/>
said, I'm going to the bathroom the stuff is on the table." Did you <br/>
get the stuff?  Iron`Bear just looked at me, and shook his head, "No <br/>
I didn't hear that part."  Oh the agony! The misery! The bad luck! <br/>
The misfortune!<br/>
<br/>
We jumped in the car and immediately headed back to the park in <br/>
Oroville; we searched frantically in a desperate attempt to recover <br/>
even a smidgen of our journal.  But to no avail  it was gone, along <br/>
with our signature stamp and a few of our dauber duos.  <br/>
<br/>
We sat in the car for a moment, staring off into nowhere, trying to <br/>
figure out what to do, and I think, just understanding the <br/>
disappointment and despair each on of us felt.  We had just lost not <br/>
only the last 95 images we had collected, but also the last several <br/>
series that we had planted, stamps that made all others we had <br/>
carved pale in comparison.  <br/>
<br/>
But the worst of it all, the most dreadful, was that the journal <br/>
contained both the Lemony Snicket stamps in Washington and <br/>
California.  Iron`Bear and I looked at each other and decided we <br/>
would figure something out.  Luckily for us most of the stamps we <br/>
had our friends had gotten with us, we could color copy their stamps <br/>
and only have to return for the ones that they didn't have.  But we <br/>
had all those California stamps in there!  So we would get them <br/>
back.  We made a mad dash through Oroville, Yuba City, Nevada City, <br/>
Grass Valley, Auburn, and Willows and visited the Lemony Snicket box <br/>
for a third time  retrieved every stamp we had gotten in the past <br/>
two days, plus two more and then hit the I-5 had started making our <br/>
way home.  However, even what we were able to accomplish didn't <br/>
quite help the sting we felt, and we where sure now, that it was <br/>
some evil plan of Count Olaf who was trying to keep us from having <br/>
any evidence that the Orphans were ever there, and trying to destroy <br/>
the image of him that we had gotten as he ran by with them in toe.  <br/>
Why he had to take our entire book and signature stamp too we will <br/>
never understand, but chalk it up to what an evil man he is.<br/>
<br/>
We write you dear fellow letter boxers and Mr. Snicket, to tell our <br/>
tale of misery, despair, and tears and to warn all others that go <br/>
for these letter boxes that they are quite well named, quite well <br/>
described and really seem to instigate a series of most unfortunate <br/>
events.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Iron`Bear and pandora{I`B}<br/>

Do you know about Retrograde Mercury? True, it doesn't actually go retrograde <br/>
until 5:32 pm today but I have found, in my 25 year study of astrology, that <br/>
Mercury's backward motion can start several days before the actual 'station' <br/>
and end many days after. It looks as though you experienced a textbook case of <br/>
the dastardly, in this case meaning frustratingly evil, planet's curse.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this means we should start calling Count Olaf, Count Mercury?<br/>
<br/>
So sorry for your troubles (you must have a particularly sensitive point at 8 <br/>
degrees of Virgo in your natal chart). Mercury goes direct on September 2 <br/>
first thing in the morning but I wouldn't plan any trips, sign any contracts or <br/>
begin anything in general until the following weekend just to be safe!<br/>

We got your I-80 #1 and your Tip of Shasta letterboxes while out there, had<br/>

We are so sorry to hear about your loss.  I am sure all letterboxers cringed<br/>
when we read your post. I know I did. When we go on vacations we usually run<br/>
into weather problems.  Like Tornadoes, huge wind storms, and the like to<br/>
close airports and shut things down for a bit. The kind of storms where you<br/>
are headed to the airport and find out it has been closed and you end up<br/>
staying in the rent by the hour motel, but we will not go there. We hope you<br/>
can recover most of what you lost.  Willow, Daisey and Heartsey.  <br/>
