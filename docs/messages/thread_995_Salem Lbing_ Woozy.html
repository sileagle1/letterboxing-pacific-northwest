to LBing. We only had time for one but they are totally hooked <br>
now. They were already talking about their personal stamps<br>
and where they could place some boxes. We got Woozy Goldfish II. <br>
Thanks to Dvn2r ckr. Its alive and well. Look for some new LBs to start <br>
appearing in the Salem area soon.<br>
Also some new ones in Central Oregon coming soon!<br>
Later,<br>
