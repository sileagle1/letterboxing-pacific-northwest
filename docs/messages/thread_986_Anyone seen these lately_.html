Heather and I tracked down Sunburst on Oct 12 (as I recall, if you'd read the <br/>
compass wrong, you could easily end up in the wrong spot).<br/>
<br/>
And we visited clever Squirrel's Delight back on Aug 8.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to discuss exactly where you looked for them, feel free to e-mail <br/>
me off list.<br/>

I got the Squirrel's Delight in September and again in October.  It's adorable!   The Sunburst box I haven't even attempted yet.  But speaking of boxes that have alluded people.. has anyone seen the Crystal Springs box lately? I've been down there TWICE in the last 2 weeks but can't seem to find it.  Although the kids LOVE feeding the ducks and the garden is beautiful so it's definitely NOT a wasted trip!<br/>

Yes, I have found Squirrel's delight in September. The log book was <br/>
pretty full so you might think about bringing along a replacement. <br/>
Needs to be small though. Email me off list and I can tell you what <br/>
size container it will fit in and any help finding it.<br/>
