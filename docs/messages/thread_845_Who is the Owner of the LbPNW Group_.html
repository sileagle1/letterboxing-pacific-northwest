I already tried that a couple days ago and low and behold I got no <br/>
answer either from the LbPNW list either.  However the LBNA group <br/>
does allow you to view the members and you can tell who the list <br/>
Owner and Moderators are.  Randy Hall  The Author of the recent book <br/>
everyone is talking about owns the LBNA Yahoo Group, and I do know <br/>
that Randy is very prompt in replying to emails.<br/>
<br/>
Seems great minds are thinking alike this morning.<br/>

Had I know that the Cape Crusader was Ryan Carpenter I would have <br/>
joined the group ages before I did so.<br/>
<br/>
I will contact him via the emergency response system by lighting the <br/>
sky with a bright turtle shape and see if he comes running over.<br/>
<br/>
Will the Cape Crusader answer this maiden's plea for help?<br/>
Will he make it in time?<br/>
Will he answer RayvenDad or come to the aid of a woman first?<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned...<br/>
