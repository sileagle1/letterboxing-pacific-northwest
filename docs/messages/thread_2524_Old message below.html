                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just looked up old messages from myself on this board.  I haven't <br>
posted since August 2004.  You see, shortly after I wrote this <br>
message, I found out my husband had been having an affair.  I wanted <br>
to work on the marriage, but he didn't and told me to take a hike, <br>
December 2004.<br>
<br>
Moved into an apartment January 2005 and bought my own townhouse in <br>
August.<br>
<br>
Now it's May 2006 and I want to LB again -- with a new logbook that <br>
will be just my own, though I will still claim all the boxes I did <br>
before!<br>
<br>
I have always wanted to meet you and go on LB camping weekend but my <br>
husband wasn't interested.<br>
<br>
Soooo, a couple of things:<br>
<br>
1)When are any camping events this summer?<br>
<br>
2) Do you know of anyone that would want to LB every now and then <br>
with me, as I don't like to go alone?<br>
<br>
3) I'm involved with a social group (meetin.org for Portland), a <br>
website for people 20's-60's, single, married, with significant <br>
others.  It's free and when people have ideas, they post an event and <br>
other people sign up.  I posted a letterbox event for July 15 and <br>
want to take these few people on an easy box or two (boxes that are <br>
hopefully not missing.)  Do you have any ideas?<br>
<br>
Thanks so much.  I actually carved a stamp for my first box to be <br>
placed on Ross Island, so you would have to canoe or kayak to get to <br>
it.  My husband and I scoped out the site.  I still plan to plant it <br>
but having moved twice and not having unpacked all of my boxes. . .<br>
<br>
Thank you for any response. <br>
<br>
Email me at susan@kuku.org.<br>

<br>
And, I'm thriving, not just surviving!<br>
