                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just looked up old messages from myself on this board.  I haven't <br/>
posted since August 2004.  You see, shortly after I wrote this <br/>
message, I found out my husband had been having an affair.  I wanted <br/>
to work on the marriage, but he didn't and told me to take a hike, <br/>
December 2004.<br/>
<br/>
Moved into an apartment January 2005 and bought my own townhouse in <br/>
August.<br/>
<br/>
Now it's May 2006 and I want to LB again -- with a new logbook that <br/>
will be just my own, though I will still claim all the boxes I did <br/>
before!<br/>
<br/>
I have always wanted to meet you and go on LB camping weekend but my <br/>
husband wasn't interested.<br/>
<br/>
Soooo, a couple of things:<br/>
<br/>
1)When are any camping events this summer?<br/>
<br/>
2) Do you know of anyone that would want to LB every now and then <br/>
with me, as I don't like to go alone?<br/>
<br/>
3) I'm involved with a social group (meetin.org for Portland), a <br/>
website for people 20's-60's, single, married, with significant <br/>
others.  It's free and when people have ideas, they post an event and <br/>
other people sign up.  I posted a letterbox event for July 15 and <br/>
want to take these few people on an easy box or two (boxes that are <br/>
hopefully not missing.)  Do you have any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much.  I actually carved a stamp for my first box to be <br/>
placed on Ross Island, so you would have to canoe or kayak to get to <br/>
it.  My husband and I scoped out the site.  I still plan to plant it <br/>
but having moved twice and not having unpacked all of my boxes. . .<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any response. <br/>

&gt; Well hey there Dharma and welcome to letterboxing! <br/>
&gt; I am so glad that you and your husband enjoyed yourself, I know <br/>
that is what<br/>
&gt; it is all about for me, letterboxing is very special to me because <br/>
it gives<br/>
&gt; Iron`Bear and I something special to do together that we both enjoy <br/>
and it's<br/>
&gt; quality time together.  I'm just tickled to know that another <br/>
couple enjoyed<br/>
&gt; getting that Fate of the Childhood as much as we enjoyed planting <br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you and your husband considered coming to the Passport to <br/>
Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; Stamp Camp in August or to Funhog's Event out in Longview this <br/>
Saturday? I<br/>
&gt; would love to meet you.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's been about a year since my hubby &amp; I have been lb'ing -- we <br/>
got <br/>
&gt; busy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In fact, at the age of 43, I graduated from Portland State <br/>
University <br/>
&gt; with an undergrad degree in June!  (43--Finally!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In fact, (off the subject), I did an altered book reflecting on how <br/>
4 <br/>
&gt; women in my family affected me for a "Women, Creativity &amp; Healing" <br/>
&gt; class.  If you want to view the book, go to www.kuku.org.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, back to lb'ing!  My hubby &amp; I went and had lunch at the zoo <br/>
&gt; cafe, then went off &amp; found the four boxes in Fate of Childhood <br/>
&gt; Series, Adventure #1.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We had so much fun!  Michael, my husband, has hiked through and <br/>
&gt; around there a lot, but we ended up on a couple of trails he had <br/>
&gt; never discovered, which is one of the joys of letterboxing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I saw in the logs Smiley, Camp Fire Woman, Sunshine, Charlie Trail <br/>
&gt; Duster &amp; others I can't remember now!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for so much fun, Pandora.  I can't wait to start another <br/>
&gt; adventure!<br/>
