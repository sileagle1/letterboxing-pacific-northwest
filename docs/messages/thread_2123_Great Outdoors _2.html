                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello - I had to change the location of Great Outdoors #2.  The <br/>
Gresham city park (Thom Park) where the 2 boxes were hidden, has been <br/>
closed as of 6/28/05.  Rather than take any chances, I pulled the <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to keep the re-plant local, so I hid them in Troutdale.  I <br/>
decided to combine the two boxes into one (with 2 stamps), since the <br/>
greenway I chose is very small.  See the letterboxing.org site for the <br/>
new clues!<br/>
<br/>
Since the location and clues are completely new, it should count as <br/>
another F1 for those who found it in its previous location, and might <br/>
want to find again, I would think??<br/>
