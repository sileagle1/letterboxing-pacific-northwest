Lily, I hope you will forgive me and others if this is a touchy <br>
subject that causes some us to over-react.  I never intended to make <br>
light of your situation.  These sorts of things are very disturbing.<br>
<br>
Thank you for sharing your humiliating experience with us, so we will <br>
all be reminded to be more aware.  I parked at a trailhead today, and <br>
was a little more careful than usual about what I had lying about in <br>
my car... and I popped out the detachable face of my stereo and <br>
placed it out of sight.  I am sometimes too careless, and your <br>
message was a wake-up call for me to think twice about security.<br>

Gratefully yours,<br>
