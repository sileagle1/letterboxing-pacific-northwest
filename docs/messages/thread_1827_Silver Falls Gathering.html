                    <div class="plaintext-content">This would be wonderful if we could get the Group Camp like we did at<br/>
Milo McIver!  That worked out wonderfully for everyone.  Folks just<br/>
showed up as they could and camped for free (at least it was free the<br/>
way Funhog and I hosted the event.  I refused to take anyone's money for<br/>
camping and hanging out with us).  <br/>
<br/>
It may be different this time depending on who is hosting and how they<br/>
want to go about paying for it.  Not everyone is willing to blow big<br/>
bucks to host their letterboxing pals at a state park.  Anyway, that's<br/>
putting the cart before the horse since a date has not firmed up yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Who's taking charge of this event this go 'round?  And by the way,<br/>
hosting an event is really not too tough.  At least it wasn't for me.<br/>
Our event was pretty loose and free.  People have different styles of<br/>
hosting.  Some folks like to have more control and have everyone<br/>
register.  That is fine.  I thought the way we did it worked out fine,<br/>
but I have a less rigid style.   Everyone always seems to enjoy<br/>
themselves no matter who hosts or how it is done.  <br/>

Hey maybe Funhog might be willing to do a class on shading for us <br/>
lowly carvers who know nothing about it... :o) I have been wanting to <br/>
learn because shading, I have noticed, makes an enormous difference <br/>
between a mediocre stamp and a masterpiece! and I  have done lots of <br/>
mediocres.... So what do you say Funhog? wanna teach me shading (and <br/>
other poeple too...gee whiz..im not being greedy) ? or someone else <br/>
with your shading abilities if your not available to do it. That <br/>
would be really awesome :o) I would love to learn new carving <br/>
techniques, since I dont have anyone to learn from my carvings are  <br/>
kind of limited by my lack of imagination I guess. Anyhoo.. thought <br/>
i'd ask!  :o) <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There was an inquiry on AQ yesterday from a local person who had heard <br/>
through the grapevine that there was a gathering, heard the camping was <br/>
full, but wanted to attend anyway because they were local, but couldn't find <br/>
any info on it.  I guess it's not officially listed with AQ because the <br/>
camping is full, but just thought I'd mention it.  Maybe an announcement <br/>
there would be nice and folks can figure out how they're going to get there <br/>
and where they're going to camp?  Particularly the local folks who can <br/>
daytrip it would be interested.  You could always state right in the <br/>
announcement that the group camp is full and details to help point the way? <br/>
My family is really, really looking forward to seeing this beautiful park, <br/>
meeting all of you, and placing what will be our first boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion, from a fairly new-bee who maybe doesn't know what she's <br/>
talking about...<br/>
