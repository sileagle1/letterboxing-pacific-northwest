Letterboxing dream this morning.  Was in the woods seeking a series <br/>
of boxes.  DVN2SKR was there and we were seeking someone elses boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I was way off the line ( tisk)and stumbled upon what at first looked <br/>
like a collection of kids toys.  Little things like Legos and Weeble <br/>
people.  ( hummm Trial and Errors Gnomes???)<br/>
<br/>
Then I see there is a shoe with all these little plastic things glued <br/>
on.  ( hummm I think that is RayvenDads new ploy but not with plastic <br/>
toys.)  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is a nod to Geocaching but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
I pick up the shoe and I hear DVN2 behind me saying "check out the <br/>
bottom"<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough the stamp is carved into the bottom of the shoe.  It is a <br/>
goodly sized shoe at that!<br/>
<br/>
The image was far and away too strange but did involve a military and <br/>
baseball (?) theme.<br/>
<br/>
I inked up but never stamped in.  Woke up instead.<br/>
<br/>
I think I need a vacation.<br/>

<br/>
On the other hand, perhaps there is some deep subconscious reasons behind<br/>
that dream... Perhaps you should get an interpretation from the Dream Team<br/>
at UW?<br/>

two (not so) little ones at the moment, I don't get enough sleep to <br/>
dream (doesn't it take at least 45 minutes of undisturbed sleep to <br/>
hit REM?)--can't remember the last time that ever happened (in over <br/>
5 years now).  Anyhow, I would consider it a dream (vacation) to be <br/>
able to go letterboxing with Hoopoe anytime!!!  AND hunting for one <br/>
of Trial N' Error's boxes--that would just be the icing on the <br/>
cake!!!  Still looking for those little gnomes, too--what a <br/>
wonderful village they have (or so it appears from the pictures)!<br/>
<br/>
Have a wonderful &amp; blessed holiday, everybody!!!  Can't wait for <br/>
boxing day... ;)<br/>

PS  Hoopoe--did you participate in the Christmas bird count today?  <br/>
Just wondering how we fared in this region this year...<br/>
