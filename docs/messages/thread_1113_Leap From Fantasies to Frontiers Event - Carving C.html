How about if this be an ongoing "group" thing. I will have a set of <br/>
carving tools available and the carving medium available at a station <br/>
in the shelter. We can all be available to help out if someone is <br/>
interested. I like the idea of us all contributing our special <br/>
technique to it! Whether it be basic or more refined! LOL!! We all <br/>
have our own set of carving tricks up our sleeve.  If there is a <br/>
special medium that you prefer to carve then bring a sample of it to <br/>
display/share. <br/>
<br/>
I know that due to trial and error (not the letterboxer) that the <br/>
heavier plumbers gasket doesn't lend itself to carving. I would love <br/>
to see what the green material is that "Evil Glenn" and "Trial &amp; <br/>
Error"  used in the Pt. Defiance Sport Series (of which we found the <br/>
first two stamps of today). Also what is the harder red/pink material <br/>
that dvn2skr used for the Insane Asylum or the material that was used <br/>
in the Cpt. Chambers Mystery box. <br/>
<br/>
I have never personally seen PZCut (that I know of) and am interested <br/>
in finding out more about Rayvenhaus' white carving material that <br/>
they used in the Snow Dogs Series. <br/>
<br/>
ANy other feedback on the subject?<br/>
