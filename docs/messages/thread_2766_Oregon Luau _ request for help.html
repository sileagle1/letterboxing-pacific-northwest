                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks H-A-F and others for offers of help. Kerry of Camp Violet went<br>
that direction over the weekend and took care of business for me. Here's<br>
the report:<br>
"Hey artTrekker- You are one lucky boxer.  Bridge construction had<br>
scraped away all the earth under half the bridge.  Your box was less<br>
than five feet away and I strongly suspect that it was only a matter<br>
of time before that side of the bridge was also affected.  I moved the<br>
box to a safer location."<br>
Yay for found boxes and letterbox heroes! As soon as I interpret the<br>
new directions and get my taxes done ;/ (yes, really), I'll get the new<br>
clues posted. Have a great luau!<br>
