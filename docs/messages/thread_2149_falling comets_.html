                    <div class="plaintext-content">just ventured out on a 6 mile hike up tahoma the other day in search of <br/>
long, lost falling comets (among other falling objects).  No sign of <br/>
said comet impressions anywhere.  Not sure if this comet survived its <br/>
first thaw back in 2003 to greet curious boxers.  Wondering if anybody <br/>
was ever able to snag said comet way back when?  I presume said <br/>
comet 'fell' into the nisqually and worked its way into the sound and <br/>
eventually the pacific at some point a few years back.  <br/>
<br/>
anybody fortunate enough to ever have found it?<br/>
