Knowing DH though, I'll be lucky if we stop to pee let alone <br/>

<br/>
Anyway, we'll be visiting my brother and his wife and my very first <br/>
niece for 2 days on the way out (mid Jan time). I have a letterbox to <br/>
place in the area, it's a tribute to who else...my new niece! Any <br/>
letterboxers in this area that could check on it in the future? My <br/>
brother isn't a letterboxer, but he may be able to do it, my plan is <br/>
to leave an email address and hope finders alert me to problems, but <br/>
if someone in the area would check it for me I'd be so grateful! It <br/>
has a great stamp (if I do say so myself!hee hee) of a victorian baby.<br/>
<br/>
email me at gryandrowansmum@yahoo.com if your interested in checking <br/>
it for me...<br/>

Thanks and stay warm everyone!<br/>
