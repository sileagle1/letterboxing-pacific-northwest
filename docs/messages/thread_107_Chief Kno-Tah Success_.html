Hillsboro or drive in and out of it a couple of times it may become <br>

inspired to plant a box in Hillsboro also... It is there now, I need <br>
to write the clues and post them, working on that now.......  Have <br>
fun looking, I hear it's supposed to be sunny this Sunday.....  And <br>
it really is findable!  Cyndie<br>
