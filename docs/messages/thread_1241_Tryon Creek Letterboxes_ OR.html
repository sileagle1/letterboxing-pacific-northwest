                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning's meeting with Ranger Karen went pretty darned well. I think she now <br/>
has a good idea of how our pastime differs from geocaching, which has been the <br/>
source of ongoing problems in the park. Her concerns are pretty much the same as <br/>
those expressed by Kyle Spinks of THPRD: environmental damage and visitor safety.<br/>
<br/>
I got a definite 'maybe' from her, which I consider much better than a definite 'no!' <br/>
She is now considering the possibility of incorporating some form of letterboxing into <br/>
their Junior Ranger Program, as is Silver Falls SP. I have offered to walk the trails with <br/>
a staff member to locate the TC boxes and identify any that might pose a problem.<br/>
<br/>
It also turns out that she is the park manager at Milo McIver SP and is totally aware <br/>
that there are boxes hidden in this park as well. I described last summer's Stamp <br/>
Camp at McIver to her. Regarding letterboxing here, she felt that this area does not <br/>
receive the volume of traffic that Tryon Creek does and is less likely to see the type of <br/>
damage that concerns her.<br/>

Everyone... cross your fingers, stay on the trails and don't hurt the trilliums! Funhog<br/>
