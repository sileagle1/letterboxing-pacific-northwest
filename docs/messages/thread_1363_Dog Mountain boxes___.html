 <br>
Took a rainy-day hike up Dog Mountain today and found Ryan's Safari box and FunHog's box as well.  Both boxes are alive and well.<br>
 <br>
Weather was blustery, to say the very least, and the rain pelted like hail.  What a brutal hike.  Pretty soaking wet by the time we made it back to the trailhead, but satisfyingly exhausted!!!  <br>
 <br>
The wildflowers were absolutely gorgeous and blooming in the thick meadow blanket!!!  Still snowcovered across the gorge on Defiance, so I'll wait a couple more weeks before heading up that direction.  I'll be placing a box in a secret special spot up there when I go!!  <br>
 <br>
It's gonna be an awesome summer!!!<br>
