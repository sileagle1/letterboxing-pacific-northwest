of our boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Bon Sigh LB<br/>
repaired and revived on 2 Jun 06 although I really wanted to <br/>
just 'retire it off'<br/>
<br/>
************<br/>
<br/>
Halitaeetus leucocephalus LB<br/>
<br/>
Placed by:  dvn2r ckr, rnrB &amp; trkr<br/>
On: 28 May 2004<br/>
Missing: 6 June 06<br/>
Retired: 6 June 06<br/>
<br/>
Des Moines Beach Park<br/>
Des Moines<br/>
King County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
<br/>
Calkins Point Letterbox  <br/>
<br/>
***likely missing report 8 Jun 06/will retire if it is indeed <br/>
missing***<br/>
<br/>
Start At: Luther Burbank Park <br/>
Mercer Island <br/>
King County <br/>
Washington State <br/>
<br/>
**reappeared on the scene unbeknownst to the planter on 2 Dec 04**<br/>
***new logbook replaced on 4 Mar 06***<br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
Little Fishy LB<br/>
<br/>
alive &amp; well on 4 Jun 06<br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
Gun Fight LB<br/>
Bothell, WA<br/>
<br/>
likely missing, will retire officially once/if I get a chance to <br/>
drive by its location<br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
Picea sitchensis LB near Seaside, OR is likely missing as we've <br/>
received 3 could not find reports on it &amp; it's a fairly <br/>
straightforward clue****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
We checked on somebody else's LB in Seattle: <br/>
<br/>
"Go Sonics" LB was alive &amp; well on 4 Jun 06--we checked on it while <br/>
geocaching in the area in which it was hidden so we could drop off <br/>
some 7 travel bugs we stumbled on in Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****************************<br/>
<br/>
So, that's what's going on--we're rapidly realizing we're not going <br/>
to have much time to repair our boxes 'one last time' before we <br/>
drive away in a couple of weeks.  We're overwhelmed with trying to <br/>
get rid of most of our belongings as we're likely moving into <br/>
a 'cubicle' next go 'round.  <br/>
<br/>
This is by far one of the most difficult things we need to do yet: <br/>
would there happen to be a loving family out there interested in <br/>
adopting 1-4 older cats (3 of whom are brothers from the same litter-<br/>
-half siamese/half farm cats one of whom is all black, another is <br/>
all grey and another is black &amp; white reverse coloring of a <br/>
Siamese//they turn 14 in Sept--the other unrelated one is an all-<br/>
around American black &amp; white domestic short hair mutt and will turn <br/>
14 around March/April)?  If so, please contact me offline.  They're <br/>
well travelled but I'm doubting they all have another <br/>
extended 'summer' cross country trip in them and would probably not <br/>
welcome living in an urban apartment for the next 6 years without a <br/>
yard or opportunity to venture outside.  :(  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
