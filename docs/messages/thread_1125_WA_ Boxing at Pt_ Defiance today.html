Poltergeists!! We spent two hours this afternoon looking for "The <br/>
Forest Gnome" and "Jarl the Wood Gnome". When the sky was rent apart <br/>
with hail we decided that those two gnomes were sending a signal that <br/>
today would not be the day to find them. <br/>
I will admit that we went back and forth on the trail counting and <br/>
recounting all the markers and still were unable to find a small <br/>
hemlock tree evenly spaced between two cedars which would be the home <br/>
of the first gnome. Even with all the possible combinations of the <br/>
triangles (forwards, backwards or facing both directions)and looking <br/>
only at cedar and hemlock combinations (I do know my trees - I used <br/>
to teach plants and trees at Camp Seymour) we were zero for zero. <br/>
So..we tried to find "Jarl" we found three curved stones on the trail <br/>
that fit into the clues but none of them revealed "Jarl" at the cedar <br/>
that was at 50*. <br/>
SO...soaking wet and cold from hail...we backtracked and went after <br/>
the Pt. Defiance #1 Box! PAYDIRT! Quite literally...the box hasn't <br/>
been visited since last summer and has only had about a dozen visits <br/>
since it was planted in 2001. With that summer being the banner year! <br/>
Due to the lateness of the day (2:30pm and our growling tummies we <br/>
decided to forgo Box #2 of that series until next weekend or the <br/>
weekend of the Leap from Fantasies to Frontiers event. <br/>
We have decided to sit and carve several stamps and get boxes ready <br/>
to plant next weekend at the park in anticipation of the Leap Day <br/>
event!<br/>
<br/>
Til later,<br/>
