I just spent about twenty minutes talking to Kyle Spinks about his<br>
concerns regarding letterboxing. His concerns are pretty much what<br>
you'd expect but is basically very open to the hobby. The big thing<br>
that came from our conversation is that he'd like to meet with a group<br>
of local letterboxers sometime before year's end.<br>
<br>
Yay! An opportunity for a gathering... who's gonna make the event<br>
stamp? It will probably be on a weekend evening and I suggested the<br>
week of December 6-7. What do you all think? He suggested someplace<br>
like McMennamin's Roadhouse. <br>

you Portlanders should venture out a bit. We have more<br>

I had written to Kyle Spinks about my Burntwood letterbox and following is <br>
the answer he sent me:<br>
<br>
Hi Annette,<br>
I have been checking the boxes in our parks at a rate of 1-5 daily and <br>
haven't quite gotten to yours yet  :-))<br>
<br>
My main concern is for the safety of the Letterbox placers and seekers.  <br>
Typically, I don't encounter many problems with Geocaches and I don't expect to <br>
find many with Letterboxes.  There are those times when I need to alert a <br>
Geocache or Letterbox hider of an issue with their 'treasure,' so it's nice to have <br>
a current email account.  Usually it's been a Geocache that has been found and <br>
stolen, but I've also found caches in poison-oak bushes or near steep banks.<br>
<br>
The general rule-of-thumb I use is the answer to the question "Would you <br>
trust your 5-year-old to seek the [Geocache or Letterbox] ALONE while you stood <br>
off to the side?"  I usually think about things such as animals or insects that <br>
may bite, terrain that is hard to cross, trip hazards, eye-level <br>
branches....you get the picture.<br>
<br>
Thanks for helping me out.  I don't foresee any problems with your Letterbox <br>
(or many others, for that matter), but I'll contact you via email if anything <br>
seems amiss.  I'll be using my work email address (kspinks@thprd.com) if I do, <br>
but you can contact me at either address.<br>
<br>
Have a great day...and stay warm!<br>
<br>
Kyle Spinks<br>

P.S.  The Green Hornet made the 2001 Tualatin Hills Nature Park gathering <br>
event stamp (and organized the letterbox table/display at the park's Earthday <br>
Fair).  It was my first letterboxing event.  I met Funhog there, too!  --Annette<br>
