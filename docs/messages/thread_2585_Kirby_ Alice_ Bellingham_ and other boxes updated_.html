<br/>
  First off, I have listed all of my boxes that were on LbNA only on AQ as well.  They can now be logged in your AQ logbooks, even if you're not a premium member.<br/>
<br/>
  I've also updated my Whatcom Falls Letterbox clues, since the first one went missing.  The updates reflect a new location and an entirely new box, including a new stamp.  So, if you found this before, it might be worth another venture to get the new stamps if you're in the area.<br/>
<br/>
  I checked in on the Kirby and Curiouser series' at Priest Point Park in Olympia, and they are all doing fine.  A couple were somewhat visible from the path, but people have left them alone, it looks like.  Please remember to rehide them well!<br/>
<br/>
  And I finally managed to expand the Kirby series to include all 12 boxed I'd originally planned to place!  So even if you've got the first 4, you may now want to make it back down (or up, as the case may be) thataway to find the last two thirds of the series.<br/>
<br/>
  Have fun, everybody!<br/>
