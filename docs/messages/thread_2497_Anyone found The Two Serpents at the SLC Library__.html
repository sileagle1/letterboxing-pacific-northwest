best friend in Utah. We spent a day around Salt Lake City and I  <br>
introduced her to letterboxing.<br>
<br>
We headed to the Salt Lake City Library and followed the clues to the  <br>
second floor and onto the shelf where the book should have been. There  <br>
was a SPACE where the book SHOULD HAVE BEEN but it wasn't there. We  <br>
were so sad!<br>
<br>
Has anyone found this letterbox?<br>
