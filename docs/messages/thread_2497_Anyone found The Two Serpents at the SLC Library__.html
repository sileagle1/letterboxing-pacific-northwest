&gt; My inspiration for a letterbox generally comes from almost anything.  <br/>
&gt; Special<br/>
&gt; events, images I run across that just jump out at me, people, places,<br/>
&gt; history, etc etc etc. Its horrible.. I too have an entire folder on my<br/>
&gt; desktop of images I want to carve but havent had time for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lately Ive been inspired more and more by historical events that my  <br/>
&gt; class<br/>
&gt; is studying or has studied. Watch this summer for some boxes on Ancient<br/>
&gt; Greece :-)<br/>

&gt; TOTW -- Do you have a particular source for inspiration for letterbox<br/>
&gt; clues or placements?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My first and foremost favorite ideas for letterboxes stem from digging<br/>
&gt; into the local history of an area. Then, secondly I like to go for long<br/>
&gt; forgotten 'kitsch Americana'--just to keep some of the old 'mod'<br/>
&gt; history revived among the public consciousness a bit longer before it<br/>
&gt; fades away into oblivion.  Then, finally I get inspired by locations--<br/>
&gt; just for their beauty or unique features &amp; usually carve/hide something<br/>
&gt; on the spot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I read incessantly so I often pore over all sorts of materials for<br/>
&gt; inspiration--newspapers, internet, old hiking books, travel<br/>
&gt; guides/brochures, maps--you name it.  Sometimes I just find an image<br/>
&gt; that I like and think may work well for a letterbox and then eventually<br/>
&gt; I'll find the 'ideal' spot for it. I've got an entire photo/negative<br/>
&gt; album &amp; another file folder that contains ideas for future stamps or<br/>
&gt; impressions of stamps I've already carved. I also have several computer<br/>
&gt; files that contain ideas for letterbox images/locations. In contrast, I<br/>
&gt; try to avoid 'commercial' type stuff for our letterboxes--TV shows,<br/>
&gt; tourist attractions (Disneyland?), copyrighted stuff but do have a<br/>
&gt; couple boxes that may fall into this arena because they bear special<br/>
&gt; meaning to us, etc.<br/>

&gt; Sad to say, the elusive Hidden Dragon seems to have taken flight since<br/>
&gt; my last visit. Glad to say, I will be replacing it soon since this is<br/>
&gt; the perfect time to make the visit. The apple trees are in full bloom<br/>
&gt; and downright gorgeous with their gnarled trunks and exuberant<br/>
&gt; flowers. I'll keep you posted... Funhog<br/>

&gt; Subject: Musicians Series<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On such a glorious spring day I just had to play hooky from work and<br/>
&gt; head out for a hike. I meet a pig in the parking lot and proceeded to<br/>
&gt; voluntarily load 30 pounds of water, rocks, trail books, and a laptop<br/>
&gt; computer onto my back. We headed down Leif Erickson Drive (this is a<br/>
&gt; trail, not a road) in Forest Park to admire the abundance of trilliums<br/>
&gt; in bloom. Along the way we stopped by to find the latest additions to<br/>
&gt; the Musician Series by Camp Fire Lady and Maiden. These are boxes that<br/>
&gt; should not be missed by any local boxer. After nabbing the boxes we<br/>
&gt; continued down the trail, up Hardesty, back on the muddy Wildwood<br/>
&gt; trail, down Water Line and then back on Leif Erickson to the cars for<br/>
&gt; about a six mile loop, making for a nice training run for this<br/>
&gt; summer's backpacking (something I'm planning for part of my sabbatical<br/>
&gt; July/August this year).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I encourage all to get out there to get these boxes: with the older<br/>
&gt; boxes there are now ten boxes in the series. Note that you are allowed<br/>
&gt; to hunt these without a 30 pound pack and if you just go out and back<br/>
&gt; on Leif Erickson Drive it is an flat easy stroll of less than 4 miles.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I packed the kids in the car and we headed to an area where a large  <br/>
&gt; number<br/>
&gt; of boxes reside.  The problem with boxing with young kids, though, is  <br/>
&gt; that they<br/>
&gt; don't necessarily want to spend the entire afternoon looking for every  <br/>
&gt; last one.<br/>
&gt; And it doesn't help motivate them when the first four (from a series)  <br/>
&gt; all have<br/>
&gt; basically the same stamp!  They actually mutinied after the fourth box  <br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; found in that series, and refused to look for the others.  By that  <br/>
&gt; time, they<br/>
&gt; weren't even interested in finding others in the area not related to  <br/>
&gt; the series.<br/>
&gt; ((sigh))<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh well.  At least we got out and enjoyed the day!<br/>

&gt; If anyone has found any of the boxes from this series, I'd love to  <br/>
&gt; hear from<br/>
&gt; you.  I haven't been out to check on them since I placed them in  <br/>
&gt; October, and<br/>
&gt; may not get out there yet for awhile.  I'm wondering if they made it  <br/>
