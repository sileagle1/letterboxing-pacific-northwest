Come bid farewell to dvn2rckr before she's far "flung" to DC.  "Fling" <br>
some letterboxes for others to hunt down.  Come meet and greet some <br>
other people that love this crazy hobby as much you do!<br>
We will be meeting in Shelter #2.<br>
Water, Electricity and Barbaque/stove is available in the covered <br>
shelter.  This shelter is the closest to the play area.  The park <br>
includes a total of 312 acres on both sides of East Bay Drive.  Access <br>
to the shoreline, rose garden and lots of nature trails await us.<br>
*************************<br>
CAUTION!!!!!!!!  There is access to the water!!  Please be mindfull of <br>
children and watch them closely!!<br>
*************************<br>
We will also be having a potluck, but everyone bring their own plates, <br>
napkins and utensils.  If you know what you will be bringing, let me <br>
know and I'll post it so everyone knows what's needed!<br>
Hopefully the trails will be dry...but let's face it.  This is <br>
Olympia, Washington.  We could be having beautiful dry weather or <br>
ankle deep in mud.  It's all part of the dvn2r we are ck'ing!<br>
