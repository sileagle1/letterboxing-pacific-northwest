Well, on a fateful day in November of 2001 it led me to a little <br>
gathering at a Pizza Place in Oregon and I met Ryan. Since then I have <br>
been traveling with Ryan (and hiking) in places that I might not have <br>
ever seen if left to my own devices! The wilds of Honduras, Guatemala, <br>
and Panama; the little podunk trail towns along the Appalachian Trail; <br>
the morros of California's Central Coast are a few examples of <br>
locations that weren't really on my life list prior to letterboxing <br>
with Ryan!<br>

That's a two-way street, you know. I've ended up in Florida, North<br>
Carolina, and--most shameful of all for a manly man such as<br>
myself--taking pictures of Easter chicks at Walt Disney World<br>
pretending to throw up.<br>
<br>
Probably spent more time in Seattle than I otherwise would have as<br>
well. ;o)<br>
