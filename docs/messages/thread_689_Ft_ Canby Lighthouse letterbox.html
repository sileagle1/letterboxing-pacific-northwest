Lighthouse Letterbox. We were unsucessful at finding. We are <br>
wondering if it being our first attempt if we just missed it or was <br>
it gone. If anyone has any info whether or not this box is alive and <br>
well or missing would be great. We are going to head that way this <br>
weekend and are going to hopefully find it and a couple others. <br>
