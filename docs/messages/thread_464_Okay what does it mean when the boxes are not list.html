He contacted several of us about the need to claim "abandoned" boxes.<br>
<br>
Where were your B.C. boxes clues posted?  On the old LBNA site? I <br>
suspect they can help you sort it out.  I have not had a chance to <br>
get away and do "foreign" boxing so I had not noticed a lack of B.C. <br>
site. <br>
<br>
I would register at the new site and then send a note to Jay <br>
reclaiming your boxes. <br>
<br>
<br>
I found a listing for your Maywood Park box ( near Packwood south of <br>
Mt Rainier)<br>
