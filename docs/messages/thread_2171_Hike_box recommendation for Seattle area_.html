Tomorrow, I may have an opportunity to goof around in Stanwood/Seattle <br/>
area.  Any boxes on a shortish, intense and beautiful hike that you <br/>
could recommend?  Short notice, that's when I suck most at boxing!  <br/>
S'hard to pick!  Thanks for your help.<br/>

<br/>
It's been ages since I was up that way &amp; I haven't kept tabs on new <br/>
boxes up there but here's some ideas as I noticed nobody else had yet <br/>
responded to your question and you're probably rushed for time before <br/>
you head out boxing tomorrow.  The boxes probably closest to where <br/>
you'll be are either in Mukilteo or the North Seattle.  A pretty park <br/>
with some intense hills and good views of Puget Sound would be Carkeek <br/>
Park--which contains a handful of letterboxes at least.  Another short, <br/>
intense hike and mid-North Seattle is Ravenna--but I'm not sure if the <br/>
clues to that box are still listed.  You could also try the Twin Ponds <br/>
LB or the Pied Piper LB--in/around Shoreline (I think). <br/>
<br/>
Other boxes relatively close to mid-Seattle--Calkins Pt (Mercer Island)-<br/>
-nice walk, beautiful park relatively easy to find from I-5--&gt;I-90.  <br/>
Several West Seattle boxes might be a good choice, too. I've also got <br/>
one in Seattle 'West Point Mule' that's about 5-6 miles--depending on <br/>
what you're idea of a short, intense hike is--it's got awesome views <br/>
and nice hiking along the way.   Traffic will likely be a bear with <br/>
Seafair starting up so I recommend a good map recon before you venture <br/>
out to see exactly where you need to drive to get to the various <br/>
parks.  You'd probably prefer to hike/explore over sitting in <br/>
traffic.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your visit!<br/>
