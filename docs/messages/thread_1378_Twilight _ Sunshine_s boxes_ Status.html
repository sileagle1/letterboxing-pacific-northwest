Bastyr -- 9 boxes here, #1 appears to be missing -- #3 may be on walk<br/>
about -- this one has gone missing before and just when I'm replacing<br/>
it, it re-appears -- we even had the beginnings of a herd out there at<br/>
one point :&gt;.<br/>
Kelsey Creek Farms -- 1&amp;2 are fine, it appears #3 is out on walkabout<br/>
again.  Much like the grazing animal at #3 Bastyr, this one has come and<br/>
gone before as well -- we had a "herd" of these at one point as well.<br/>
Blythe Park -- 1&amp;2 are fine -- #3 is apparently missing -- will have to<br/>
check this one out.<br/>
<br/>
There you go -- replacing will likely happen in the next couple of weeks<br/>
-- and look for another compass based set out at Cottage Lake this<br/>
summer (YMCA camp moved :&gt;).  I'll post when replacements have been<br/>
found (or when they wander home...)<br/>
