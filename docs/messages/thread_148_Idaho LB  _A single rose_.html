Wanted to let you know we stopped briefly on Boise on our way home <br/>
from Utah last Saturday. We had a great time playing on the rocks <br/>
and looking at the fish at the Depot. "A Single Rose" was alive and <br/>
well. I will be going through again in June and plan to stop for <br/>
more boxes. It is a great reason to stop and stretch on that long 12 <br/>
hour drive to Grandmas house. <br/>
