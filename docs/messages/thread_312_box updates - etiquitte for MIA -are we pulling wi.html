                    <div class="plaintext-content">Does anyone else think that if the placer has abandoned a box and no-one else takes on the stamp replacement or care for it as an orphan,  that the box clues should be removed or at least a notation made on the clue page, that it has gone missing?<br>
 <br>
If not completely removed, then list it as missing on the main page's  state listing so we don't waste time hunting for clues for something that isn't even there and hasn't been there for a long time.<br>
 <br>
With the new site, it seems like there should be a way to update each of the clue pages to include the " reported MIA as of DDMMYY" to be added if it is verified missing.  Like Oxbow #2 and Council Crest and Rock Creek, every time a new boxer goes on a hunt for these permanently missing boxes, the thread starts again. <br>
 <br>
 It would make LB outings much more pleasant and less frustrating to hunt for a box that is known to be alive and well as of DDMMYY, rather than finding out after you get home from a tedious search that it has been reported missing several times, even a year ago and worse tedium is hunting through the banter on the threads to see if there is a mention of each and every box that you plan to find. <br>
 <br>
 It would be especially frustrating for someone from out of state on a 1 time short visit. You could schedule your time to search only for boxes that are alive and well rather than come back empty handed.  Granted it is nice to go to the areas even if there isn't a box, but if your plan is to find a box and you spend time hunting for something has been missing .....  Especially if you spend time deciphering cryptograms like Rock Creek and come up emptyhanded!<br>
 <br>
Just a thought, or a fly in the ointment. <br>

You might think that a rigirous verification sysytem, like a <br>

box that you did  not know was missing. However, it sure is nice to <br>
know if a box is missing especially if you have a trip for <br>
letterboxing planned.  We just took a trip to the beach and searched <br>
for 4 and came up with only 2.  If I had known that they were <br>
missing I would have searched for something else. Don't get me <br>
wrong, the hikes we went on were lovely, LB or missing LB, but it <br>
would have made it nicer to know!!!  But with no way to take care of <br>
this issue, it is all in the thrill of the hunt, whether you come up <br>
with a find or missing!!!!<br>
Just my 2 cents worth!!!<br>
