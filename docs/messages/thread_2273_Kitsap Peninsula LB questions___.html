<br/>
I received the following email (not sure why it came to me) from a <br/>
geocacher who has stumbled upon numerous letterboxes lately and was <br/>
wondering if any of you could help this fellow out.  I'm not <br/>
familiar with this letterbox.  Please respond directly to him to <br/>
avoid 'letting out the mystery' but if you could drop me a note to <br/>
let me know you contacted him so I can 'drop it' that would be <br/>
awesome!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
dvn2r ckr<br/>

Message: <br/>
A friend of mine has discovered another Letterbox cache and neither <br/>
of us can find a listing for it.<br/>
<br/>
It is located in the SW corner of the Seabeck Cemetery at Seabeck, <br/>
WA. It is a very short distance from my friend's GC.COM cache, near <br/>
an odd looking tree.<br/>
<br/>
Can you shed some light on this cache?<br/>
<br/>
You can email this individual directly.  <br/>
