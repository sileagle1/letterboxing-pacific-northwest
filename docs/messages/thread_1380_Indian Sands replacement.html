letterbox?  I planted it in February and just found out yesterday it <br/>
was gone.  I live several hundred miles away from the area so I <br/>
can't check on it too often.  I do apologize if you have looked for <br/>
it and couldn't find it.  I have devised a new hiding spot for it, <br/>
though it isn't out on the spectacular cliffs anymore.  You should <br/>
still wander out there while you are there, especially now, since <br/>
there are an abundance of truly delightful wildflowers, <br/>
unfortunately, a ways away from the new box's hiding spot. Hopefully <br/>
I have planted it somewhere it can enjoy a longer life than it's <br/>
predecessor.  I will be back in October to check.<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
