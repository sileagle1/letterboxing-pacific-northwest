<br>
Have you ever________ while letterboxing? Just fill in the blank, but <br>
remember this is a family channel.<br>

something funny that my coworker showed me. Warning though---it <br>
involves geocaching instead of letterboxing.  She geocaches with her <br>
family and they actually found slugs 'in the act' while hunting a <br>
geocache.  That image is now her screensaver at work!<br>

Here goes:<br>
<br>
...seen a tarantula in the middle of the trail! (Alum Rock Park, San <br>
Jose, CA)<br>
<br>
...stumbled upon cacti overlooking the Hudson River in New York! <br>
(Opuntia)<br>
<br>
...been forced off the trail by an armed SWAT team--not once, but <br>
twice! (Lacey, WA)<br>
<br>
...found letterboxes without clues (not yet posted--or even developed <br>
yet--to the world)--not once, but twice! (Hidden Palms in Multnomah <br>
Falls, OR & Carmel-by-the-Sea in Carmel, CA)  <br>
<br>
Well, if you count GT's Clueless box the way WE found it--then that <br>
raises it to three. ;)  Add in the Fore! box in Winton Hills, OH and <br>
that makes 4 completely, utterly clueless boxes for us.<br>

What about the rest of y'all?<br>

Well, let's see....  One of the first boxes I found had a stash of<br>
porn also hidden in the tree. That was kind of a surprise. (It was the<br>
Fanno Creek box, in case you're wondering.)<br>
<br>
Then there's the well-known "naked man" incident where I saw a naked<br>
man hiking down the trail where I was looking for letterboxes. (Denny<br>
Creek, in case you're wondering.)<br>
<br>
Amanda and Princess Lea found a couple who were... uh.... making out,<br>
I guess, while looking for letterbox in California. Dunno which box<br>
that was.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, Catbird and Lizard once told me of discovering a<br>
couple of people going at it while looking for one of the Point<br>
Defiance boxes.<br>
<br>
But because it's a family channel, I won't get into any details here. ;o)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My friend and I also found illicit materials while looking for Whizbang's boxes in Mt. Vernon.  Except, in that case, somebody had gone so far as to cut out some of the pictures and hang them up on little twigs, so as you're venturing through the overgrown not-such-a-path-anymore, you're suddenly staring at a photo of a nakie man, which is hanging inches from your eyes.  There were also plenty of used prophilactics in the area, though (sadly) those have become quite common.  Another one of those Mt. Vernon boxes had us sitting in the car and eating lunch (it was yucky weather) and attempting to ignore the marital dispute in the car next to us.<br>
   <br>
  Still never found any of those three boxes, though.  We had found every box we had attempted before those three, too!<br>

Well...I've never done "the act" while letterboxing, but I've seen <br>
others!  (Silver Falls State Park, "Silver Falls Series")<br>
<br>
I also slipped and rolled down a muddy hill in the rain at the Heceta <br>
Head Lighthouse box and had to go into the restroom (where there are <br>
no locks or doors) and strip down to almost nothing to clean my <br>
clothes.  I looked like a caked, muddy mess!  I was just praying that <br>
no one would come in while I was standing there in my underwear!<br>
