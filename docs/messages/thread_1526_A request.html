<br/>
As many of you know a few weeks ago, pandora and I lost our log book in<br/>
Oroville California, we have been trying to retrieve all of the stamps that<br/>
were lost in that logbook. However we have hit a wall, and are not able to<br/>
retrieve several stamps. So what I am asking for is for anyone that happens<br/>
to have a scanner and has the following images and would consider out of the<br/>
kindness of their hearts giving us a helpful hand in retrieving these images<br/>
to please contact me privately. <br/>
<br/>
It's a bird it's a plane - in Oregon City - *side note we tried to retrieve<br/>
this image today, and I believe that this box is missing, or it has been<br/>
moved from its original spot.<br/>
<br/>
Clackamas County Rub Dub - in Oregon City<br/>
<br/>
Fantasy Forest Series - in Estacada <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you well.<br/>
