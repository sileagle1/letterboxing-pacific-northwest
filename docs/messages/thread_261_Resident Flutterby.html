exist.    As a non- resident in your area I suspect that finding this <br/>
one is going to be nearly hopeless.  Very likely an Ah-ha moment.  I <br/>
will have to print out the clues and be prepared to stumble over it <br/>
and the Chief when I am down that way in August.<br/>
<br/>
Do they permit U turns in Oregon?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it is vacation season soon.  We would not want our <br/>
easternvisitors to miss out on the fun here.  I started boxing last <br/>
year in June.  I followed Wanda and Pete all over the area they <br/>
seemed to be a day ahead of me the whole way.  I could almost trace <br/>
their vacation!<br/>

(Yes, let's all just ignore my recent public over-excited misassumption about <br/>
Flutterby's location.)<br/>
Now I just need to find the time to get to that new location and attempt to <br/>

But...the fact that your sonar failed to locate it concerns me, Paisley.  I <br/>
