Hi! Mighty quiet 'round here... must be the holidays :o) I thought I <br/>
might just throw out a tip ;o) today is Sandi's birthday (shes 25, <br/>
but you didn't hear that from me) so for her birthday present I was <br/>
thinking, what do I get for a letterboxer? which turned into, what do <br/>
I want for letterboxing? what every one wants!  A FLAT DRY SURFACE TO <br/>
STAMP ON!!!!! So how did I fix this problemo? I bought 2 school <br/>
pencil pounches with the 3-ring binder holes on them, and a square of <br/>
particle board which I drilled holes into on the left and right sides <br/>
and attached the pencil pouches with strong ribbon knotted several <br/>
times. The pencil pouches can hold the logbook, stamps, pens, <br/>
inkpads, napkins, car keys, and all the other stuff we tote around <br/>
with us and it is small enough to fit comfortably in a backpack or to <br/>
be carried, because it folds up. And the wood makes for a flat, dry, <br/>
even surface to stamp on :o) Hope this might help some of you people <br/>
for holiday gift ideas for other LBers or for yourself on the trail. <br/>
As for me, my days of toting around the gallon sized ziploc freezer <br/>
bag are over! Happy holidays to you all!<br/>
