Gone FISHING for letterboxeRs lately?  <br/>
<br/>
This is the perfect time to meet some letterboxeRs in Idaho.  You'll <br/>
have some FISHY letterboxes to find as well.  The theme is anything <br/>
FISHY.  Can you smell it?  So if you like, dress like a FISH, flop <br/>
like a FISH, bring FISHY food, or whatever you FISH like.  It might <br/>
not have to taste FISHY, but how about look FISHY, or feel FISHY?  <br/>
Bring some tasty FISH snacks/drinks for others to enjoy.  Get your <br/>
scales ready as you won't want to miss out on all the FISH fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this event FISHY enough for even J-Bear to attend?        <br/>
<br/>
Bring your friends and family and meet other letterboxers.  <br/>
<br/>
An option is to forget the FISH altogether, and come as you are, but <br/>
remember your letterboxing logbook and stamp to exchange with <br/>
others.  Dare you bring a HitchHiker to exchange in the hostel.  Go <br/>
FISH!   <br/>

all contributed to this event and to this region.  I'm in awe!!!  In <br/>
fact, I was hooked! Thanks for a wonderful afternoon.  You all are an <br/>
incredible group of artistic boxers.  I've seen so many new versions of <br/>
pfish, now...<br/>

I really enjoyed the chum, trailer-park caviar, ghoti cookies and so <br/>
much more.  How creative y'all are!!!  Thanks again,<br/>

Dump above in a bowel.  In a sauce pan combine 3/4 cup white vinigar (add a few drops of red wine vinigar or a really good balsomic)  1/2 cup olive oil or other healthy alternative. You can skip the oil all together if you like.  1/2 cup sugar or 4 packets of splenda.  Heat until the sugar is disolved, cool and add to the canned stuff. If you are not using the sugar, you can mix it all in the same bowel.  Chill before serving.  Great for picnics because nothing can cause food poisoning.WD'A<br/>
