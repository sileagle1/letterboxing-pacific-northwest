 <br>
I'm not sure you want me to have the Order of the Purple Heart for this one, but here it goes.....<br>
 <br>
While planning to return the boxes to Tryon Creek late on Friday, I was crossing over a large log (elsewhere), stepped off wrong and did some tissue damage to my knee.  Needless to say, we did not get the boxes back to their homes and I am on crutches for a while.....    it may be a while before we get back over there. (no ACL or bone damage)<br>
 <br>
Funhog, you are a true diplomat!  Let us know what is to happen.  We will be happy to get the boxes back in there as we are able, if they need to be relocated, we will be happy to find new places to hide them when/if needed with the Ranger's assistance.  Does she have the Iron Mountain box?  We looked for that one, originally, but only found the Orphan and High Bridge. <br>
 <br>
I am sorry if anyone went looking for those boxes, as we still have them.<br>
