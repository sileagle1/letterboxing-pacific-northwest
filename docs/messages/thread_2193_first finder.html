We're pretty new to this still... what kinds of things are put in<br>
letterboxes for first finders? I like the idea but I'm not sure where<br>
to go with it. <br>

left first finder prizes, but haven't done so for a long time. It's fun to do but I <br>
would only do it if it were a special box and I had something that was just the <br>
right fit for the theme of the box.  If it is done too much then  it's expected and <br>
the excitment wears off.<br>
