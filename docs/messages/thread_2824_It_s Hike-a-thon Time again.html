                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey there! I have been out to the Olympic Peninsula and all over the <br>
Seattle area the last couple of days getting the mileage in for the <br>
WTA Hike-a-thon 2007. (and maybe finding a letterbox or two along the <br>
way) :-)<br>
<br>
My goals this year are to hike 50 miles and raise $1,000 for the WTA. <br>
As most of you know, the trails and forest service roads up to the <br>
trails really took a beating last fall and winter. And every penny <br>
collected for the WTA goes to maintaining and building trails in <br>
Washington State. <br>
<br>
This year I am sending a book by John Sandford or Nevada Barr to <br>
everyone who pledges! <br>
<br>
Be sure to check out my blog for more information and updates on my <br>
trail adventures.<br>

<br>
The entire month of August is hike-a-thon month and I need to collect <br>
all my pledges by Sept. 3rd. So far I am up to 33 miles hiked and <br>
$765 dollars pledged!<br>
