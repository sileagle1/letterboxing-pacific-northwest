I did Trial & Errors Federation Forest boxes Saturday. The good news is all<br>
the boxes were alive and well thought seemingly a bit lonely. Beautiful day<br>
at a beautiful place. Oh yeah, I ran in to a group of friendly Gnomes that<br>
live in the area. Nice little village they have and a real friendly bunch!<br>
If you do these boxes make sure you seek out these little folks and drop by<br>
their place.<br>

Look around the site you might see some other boxes of interest.<br>
