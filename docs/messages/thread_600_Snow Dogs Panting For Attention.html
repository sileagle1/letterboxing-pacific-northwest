Great Job, Ravenhaus!!!  Great park, great trails, great clues, great stamps, can't wait to get back there and get the rest.<br>

Thanks Fudrick,<br>
<br>
    It was such a wonderful feeling to know that some one was able to follow our clues and that they appreciated the stamps.  Those were the first ones ever carved by RayvenMom and she was so worried that no one would like them.  Planting the boxes was an interesting endeavor as we ran the boxes 3 times ourselves and then once with a 'Beta Tester' (Heart's a Flame).  RayvenMom and I did not agree all the time on the definition of a "Y" in the trail, a "T" in the trail or a "Triangle" in the trail, hence the word "Intersection" (Grin).<br>
<br>
    We certainly had a blast placing and making it, learned so much along the way, and thanks to everyone who gave hints and tricks.  We are already working on the Black Pearl series.<br>
<br>
    Fudrick, please contact me off list at kerjin at myndworx dot com and let me know the details if you would please, problems, etc, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
Steve of Rayvenhaus<br>

Well the Snow Dogs are getting a little more company.  I found 5 of <br>
them yesterday, but the heat got to me before i finished.  I can <br>
relate to the long trek, luckily some kids pointed me in the <br>
direction of the creek, so I stumbled upon Diesel.  I liked the <br>
clues, challenging, but accurate, without giving the whole thing <br>
away.  I figure if I can find a letterbox on the second try, I'm OK, <br>
and the clues are at just the right level of difficulty for me.  :)<br>
<br>
Will probably go back in a couple of weeks to finish up.  Thanks for <br>
the suprises along the way... I stumbled onto one while looking for <br>
a "real" one...  <br>

Thanks for the tip.  I think my son somehow got into my Yahoo profile <br>
and did a little "editing".  It all appears to be fixed now.<br>
