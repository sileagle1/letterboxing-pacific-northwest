found BonAppetit on Cooks Butte and that was sure fun, take the <br/>
moisquito spray however, they were bouncing off of us after we put <br/>
it on!!!!!!!  Then went on to do Boxed set which we have been dying <br/>
to figure out!!!!!  Very fun series, makes ya think!!!!  We just <br/>
about gave up looking for love on the ground but were very happy <br/>
when it came into view!!!!!  Thanks for great boxes and even better <br/>
stamps!!!!!!  If you haven't gotten these two series of boxes I <br/>
would reccomend that you do!!!!<br/>
