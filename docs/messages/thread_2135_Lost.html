<br>
Well, twice during the Silver Falls weekend, I misplaced my signature stamp. <br>
I guess it was so happy in such a beautiful park that it wanted to stay. <br>
The last time I lost it, I'm sure it was at Box 3 in Funhog's series Wood <br>
and Water, because I didn't use it again until I tried to the next morning <br>
at the Calypso Orchid.  We were sitting above the log on the trail to avoid <br>
the hornets, and there was much stamping and handing around going on, as <br>
SloMo and Wood aug arrived as we were placing a HH.  We did this walk in the <br>
evening of July 4, so I think it's not likely anybody was there after us - <br>
most of you had gone home already.  But if anybody should happen to visit <br>
that box and find my sig stamp, I'd be so happy to have it back.  It's easy <br>
enough to recarve a replacement, but it's my very first one.  I'm kind of <br>
sad about it.<br>
<br>
If you didn't happen to exchange with me and know what it looks like, I do <br>
have a picture in my AQ profile.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much, and again, so lovely to meet all of you.  Thanks Pungent Bob <br>
and Funhog for the great trip!<br>
<br>
Lisa<br>
<br>
P.S. - did anybody pick up the Pungent after I hid it again?  I told several <br>
people who had already found it, where it was, but don't know what happened <br>
after that.  We re-hid it in Group Camp C after the rangers came and began <br>
cleaning up A.<br>
