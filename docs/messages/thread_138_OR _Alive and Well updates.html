of boxing over the last couple of weeks.<br>
<br>
Spirit of Dartmoor is wonderful!   We were the 1st there since last <br>
September to stamp in!<br>
<br>
Nutria-  very cute we saw 1 duck and lots of raindrops!<br>
<br>
Oregon Trail looking good - very nice stamp but the downpoor left us <br>
with a smudged print.<br>
<br>
Beacon Rock is alive and well, even in a hail storm it is difficult <br>
to be discreet!  We barely got the box put away when a couple of <br>
drenched hikers came past. It was close.<br>
<br>
Has anyone found the Council Crest box - Mad Stamper's?  We looked in <br>
all the possible places (we think) to no avail, fear it has been <br>
obducted.<br>
<br>
Thank you all so much for providing so much fun and beautiful <br>
stamps!!!!  So many boxes so little time. Wahhoo!<br>

We may try Council Crest again.  Marquam Trail is a nice city walk anyway.  Thank you!<br>
