The Taylor Mountain series most likely won't have any new boxes added <br>
soon. We are in the process of moving from the Hobart area out to <br>
Enumclaw. I might get some time to add another box, but I really <br>
doubt it. I hope to add to it someday, but I just don't know when <br>
that will be. I guess I may just have to start a new series out in <br>
southeast King county someday.<br>
<br>
I will eventually be posting a map of Taylor Mtn. to my site, too, <br>
but I don't know when that will be.<br>
