I did want to thank preBoxed and everyone else for organizing last<br>

some of you! I wish I'd had time to make it all the way around the<br>

to meet with you all again soon! <br>

Now, now... no boycotting!  I would be happy to have you hang around <br>
until I show up, but I bet it's about 8:30 before I get there.  And <br>
there still won't be any condiments.<br>

Excellent! Hopefully, we will be able to show Wes that he isn't in<br>
Kansas anymore. Even though he's no longer the Wizard behind the<br>
curtain at LbNA, his role in creating a user friendly site is worthy<br>
of grand kudos. (May 16th at Laurelwood Public House on NE 40th, 6 PM<br>
for those who don't know.)<br>
