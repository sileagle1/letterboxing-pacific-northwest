Not sure who this guy is, but it seems he's got some letterboxing <br>
stuff.  *shrug*<br>

I hear he's talkative -- and he told me that hats at all CafePress shops <br>
are $2 off with coupon code WARMHEAD, which expires 3/8/04....<br>

Oh no!  I have that SAME shirt.<br>
<br>
But I promise I'm not your arch-rival, or enemy or ANYTHING like that.  (I have my very <br>
own g********* arch rival (or rather, he seems to think we're having a competition...) and <br>
it's about as annoying as it can possibly be.<br>
<br>
I am just getting started with letterboxing, and have been doing the OTHER sport for <br>
about 5 months.  I need the brain stimuli!!<br>
<br>
I do believe, however, if you WANT cool tshirts, it is possible to create cool tshirts! <br>

Well, I actually like that shirt a lot, and it's just a joke that she is my <br>
'arch rival', because really she is one of my best friends... she likes to <br>
use the gps to log how far she has walked and all... we like to tease each <br>
other 'bout it... so when she got her cool g shirt, she rubbed it in.... <br>
*grinz*<br>
<br>
Have a great day, Jessi<br>
