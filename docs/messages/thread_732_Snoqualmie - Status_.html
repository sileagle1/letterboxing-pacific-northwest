                    <div class="plaintext-content">After an early start to my work day I decided that I had to take a <br>
stroll out to Snoqualmie Falls for a 'check-up' hunt.  It appears <br>
Mischief's Snoqualmie Falls series is doing just fine, both 1 and 2 <br>
were uncovered, but fixed - snug as a bug now.  Odd that #2 was all <br>
but sitting out in the open for anybody that happen to be there but <br>
contents and such are great.  <br>
<br>
As for soggy2pair's Falls in Love LB that is still snug, near <br>
Mischief's #2.<br>
<br>
The weather is suppose to be fabulous this week, and if you haven't <br>
been to the Falls it is a great opportunity to nab a total of 4 <br>
LB's. The trail is steep but not difficult, at least not until the <br>
rain starts and makes it real slick.<br>
<br>
Have a great time, travel safe and don't forget to bring an extra <br>
bag to haul some trash out - - it is about as bad as I've ever seen <br>
it.<br>
