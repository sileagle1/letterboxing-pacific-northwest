stroll out to Snoqualmie Falls for a 'check-up' hunt.  It appears <br/>
Mischief's Snoqualmie Falls series is doing just fine, both 1 and 2 <br/>
were uncovered, but fixed - snug as a bug now.  Odd that #2 was all <br/>
but sitting out in the open for anybody that happen to be there but <br/>
contents and such are great.  <br/>
<br/>
As for soggy2pair's Falls in Love LB that is still snug, near <br/>
Mischief's #2.<br/>
<br/>
The weather is suppose to be fabulous this week, and if you haven't <br/>
been to the Falls it is a great opportunity to nab a total of 4 <br/>
LB's. The trail is steep but not difficult, at least not until the <br/>
rain starts and makes it real slick.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time, travel safe and don't forget to bring an extra <br/>
bag to haul some trash out - - it is about as bad as I've ever seen <br/>
it.<br/>

&gt; It's obviously been tourist season, hasn't it?  We'll definitely <br/>
try <br/>
&gt; to find your letterbox sometime soon--we've always been intrigued <br/>
by <br/>
&gt; its name.  Just gotta find a nice day to drive the 160+ miles <br/>
&gt; roundtrip to find it.  Will definitely try, though!  Thanks for <br/>
&gt; placing one so far from your home!<br/>
