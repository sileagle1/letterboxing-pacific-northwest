This was obviously a misunderstanding so let's not make a mountain <br>
out of a molehill.  Surely you can understand how someone might be <br>
confused when you write "We took our dog by mistake".  If you left <br>
your dog at the car, then did you really make a 'mistake'?  It <br>
implies you did take your dog into the park, and getting ruffled for <br>
someone following your statement to its natural conclusion isn't <br>
going to help.<br>
<br>
Wow, and to think, I almost missed this exciting thread since I <br>
wasn't interested in any boxes in Federal Way.  =)<br>
<br>
However, if there's a lesson to be learned from this--anyone that's <br>
hiding a letterbox where dogs aren't allowed, it might be a good idea <br>
to mention that in the clue so 'mistakes' like this don't happen <br>
again.  I'll start making a point of including such information in my <br>
clues.  (Starting today, though, I'm not fixing my clues <br>
retroactively to do that.  Hiker beware.)<br>

I did bring my dog in, I was wrong, I am sorry, I won't do it again! <br>
I drove 45 minutes with my girls and a neighbor girl who lbs with us, <br>
and while that doesn't make it right, that was why we did it anyway. <br>
I am 100% sure I'm not the only one to ever do this, in fact, in <br>
terms of impact, the teenagers hanging out on the bench just inside <br>
the park smoking and swilling beer who left butts and empty beer <br>
bottles (which, by the way, we retrieved) made a LOT more that day.<br>
<br>
When I wrote the clues and hids the boxes I didn't own a dog, so I <br>
never noticed the rule. Lets just say I'll pay a LOT more attention <br>
now, and not do it again. I'm feeling a *little* bad for my post <br>
earlier, but there are better ways to tell someone you object to <br>
their actions. Like, tell them. Don't post rude things. (Like, <br>
calling someone a jackass, right?) Anyway, that wasn't you, I'm just <br>
saying, I'm sorry. For the dog.<br>

Explorer Dog that has tons of great ideas about day hikes etc. with <br>
your animals here in the Pacific Northwest.<br>
I go there often just to get some ideas for places to plant <br>
letterboxes. :-)<br>

My Halloween letterboxes are at Cougar Mountain and Dogs are allowed <br>
on lease! So get into the Fright Fest Spirit by getting these <br>
letterboxes. :-)<br>
