letterboxes for us to find.  I have started this amazing sport with my 2 daughters in <br/>
July and we just love it.  I look forward to placing my own someday soon in a <br/>
park by my house here in Vancouver.  We have found about 53 boxes.  We have <br/>
gone out for 4-6 hours at a time and are really enjoying our adventures and <br/>
seeing many amazing parks that we never knew existed.  Today we went to Lewisville <br/>
Park in Battleground, WA and did the new Postman Series.  It is very <br/>
kid-friendly and the stamps are just beautiful.  I have a small request though.  Please <br/>
seal those plastic bags or the books will get wet.    I really look forward <br/>
to meeting all of you at the next gathering.  I am Willow and my kids are Daisy <br/>
and Heartsey.  We travel with Campfire Lady, Goofy and Critter.  Our team <br/>
name is Runamuck or D.A.T.T.  Thanks again and maybe we will get to exchange <br/>
stamps sometime.  Willow.  <br/>
