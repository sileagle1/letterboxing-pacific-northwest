Camp Fire lady: I have had a box that sat unfound for 6 months before<br>
it was found and it isn't a tough one to find. Be patient. Someone<br>
will get there. <br>
<br>
Someone posted a while back that newbies tend to be self-centered, and<br>
when I saw it I was a tad offended, but maybe it's true in a way.  I'm<br>
sure you all remember carving your first pieces of art, obsessing<br>
about what to put in the box, what kind of box to use, all that etc.<br>
etc., and then you place it and walk away and think about it lying<br>
there hidden all night and the next day, and then maybe you go back to<br>
look and see is it still there, and of course it IS, and then you<br>
think about it all the time.  When it rains you think about your<br>
little log book and stamp all nice and dry inside the box.  I've<br>
planted quite a few in remote areas and will be surprised if they are<br>
ever visited, but if they are, I will know I maybe had a hand in<br>
bringing someone to place they might not have visited otherwise.  I<br>
know for a fact I would not have gone to many of the places I've been<br>
this summer had it not been for certain boxes I was after.  So<br>
self-centered, maybe yes, but hopefully in a good way, and thanks<br>
everyone for those boxes in the beautiful more remote spots as well as<br>
the ones in the funky urban areas that are just plain fun to find. <br>
That Wilson box is a hoot.  I will just keep placing and try to be<br>
patient waiting for the visitors that will come in time.  <br>
