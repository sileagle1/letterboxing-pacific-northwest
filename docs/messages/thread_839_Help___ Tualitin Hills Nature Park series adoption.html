recarve.  Does anyone out there have them??????  I'll give it a week <br/>
or so before I start carving replacements with out the originals.... <br/>
Also, if more than one person wants to replace a carving and help I <br/>
would love it, we would have more than one person's stamps placed <br/>
there then! And I would/could maintain them.  Contact me off list @ <br/>

lol, stupid newbie I am and all :)....  I think I remember it was you <br/>
who told me that they were placed by him.  I very much respect his <br/>
position, wishing he was still participating also!  Maybe I had a <br/>
wrong e-mail addy??????  I did post a while back about wanting to <br/>
adopt this series then and he didn't add to the string then either, <br/>
(so sad!) Anyway, I would love to adopt this series, and Tom, if you <br/>
are lurking, let me know what you think :)  can ya send me copies of <br/>
what you have Funhog?   Thanks so much..  Wingnut<br/>

<br/>
Like Funhog, I've got the original stamps in my logbook except for <br/>
the one that went missing the day it was announced.  As far as I <br/>
know, nobody actually had the chance to nab that box before it flew <br/>
the coop.  But there's only 2 of the 8 left?  Are you sure?  I might <br/>
have to go back out there and verify which ones really are missing or <br/>
not.  Perhaps I can carve some and replace one or two of the boxes <br/>
while on the trail.  =)  Or maybe not.  *shrug*<br/>
