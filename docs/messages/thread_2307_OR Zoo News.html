Zoo saying they had a "box with a stamp book in it" of mine. The found<br/>

find that this was the original Packy's Place box that went missing<br/>
over a year ago! So, I trundled on down to it's home to check up on<br/>
the replacement box I had made. Lo and behold, that one was missing...<br/>
so, the original is back in its hiding spot awaiting the next visitor.<br/>

While at the Zoo, I checked on all the other boxes that I know of<br/>
livimg there and found every one of them safe and sound. Both the<br/>
Wapiti and Winking Eagle boxes have moved slightly from their original<br/>
homes but the clues will still get you there. I think both have<br/>
groundskeepers who have taken them under their wings since their<br/>
camouflage materials seem to move along with the boxes. Take extra<br/>
paper if you go for the Lorikeet box as the log is full, once again. <br/>

I added the wonderful Mystic Tiger to my logbook today. If this is any<br/>

middle school where I work.  A couple of weeks later, the science <br/>
teacher and I took all of our 6th and 7th graders on a field trip to <br/>
the zoo.  Most of the kids from my letterboxing class had pre-printed <br/>
the clues to the zoo boxes and brought all of their supplies to <br/>
letterbox while they were there.  They loved all of the boxes they <br/>
found there--especially the Packy box and the Mystic Tiger.  We even <br/>
turned some of the parent volunteers on to letterboxing and now they <br/>
take their kids out on the weekends!  Thanks for your great boxes!  A <br/>
day away from school/work and the chance to letterbox--what could make <br/>
a better day!<br/>
