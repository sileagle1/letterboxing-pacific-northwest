worried that everyone's retired from letterboxing and there are no new<br/>

propose that we start a 'topic of the week' discussion. <br/>
<br/>
For the first one, my suggestion is the question, "What things would<br/>
you like to see as a PNW Topic of the Week?" I know that some of the<br/>
other regional lists do this as a regular feature and it has resulted<br/>
in lots of boxers getting to know the other locals. Let's give it a<br/>
try. Any suggestions? Funhog<br/>
