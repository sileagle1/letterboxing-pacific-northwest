:) How kind of you.  I do enjoy midieval books, themes, pictures.  I <br/>
hope they were well-hidden.  It was snowy at the time and I knew it <br/>
was risky trying to hide them...  But they apparently survived just <br/>
fine.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the heads up on the boxes, I'll check those out.<br/>
