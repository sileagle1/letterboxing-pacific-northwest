Hello,<br>
<br>
I'm fairly new to this and very new to atlas quest.  I'm having some problems figuring out where to start...  for example: Here Kitty Kitty in Tacoma says to park on the west side of the park; but which park? <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Jessi<br>

<br>
    <br>
                  <br>
<br>
<br>
      What are Treasure Hikers?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yep. We're all treasure hikers in the general sense of the word... each little piece of art set free in the world is a treasure to plant and find.<br>
<br>
But there is a larger game afoot to encourage more boxes on longer distance trails and paths, and that game is Treasure Hikers!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Treasure Hiking is a fun way to set hiking goals while letterboxing and earn cool pathtags or other accessories!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Guidelines<br>
<br>
One point for each mile hiked while letterboxing, either finding or planting, on hikes of 1 mile or longer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Friendly Suggestions:<br>
<br>
~ Each hike must be a minimum of one (1) mile in length.<br>
<br>
~ Maintenance should not count  you will be doing maintenance anyway ;-)<br>
<br>
~ Points should only be counted once for the purposes of "hiking while letterboxing". So if you hike out to a box you have already found with a friend or for maintenance, enjoy the walk, but don't count the points. <br>
<br>
~ The true Treasure Hiker Spirit is about hiking while letterboxing, and reporting is on the honor system, so lets all try to play fair and have fun. If you "cheat", you are only denying yourself boxes you haven't found, miles you haven't hiked, and beautiful places you haven't seen!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep track of your hikes by adding the Treasure Hiker Widget to your My Page. When you get your 25 miles, email Camp Fire Lady for the address to send your $3.00 (for each tag) and a SASE and you will receive your tag!! List should include date, mileage, boxes found but is not necessary. This is an honor system and I would think you would not want to cheat yourself by acquiring your pathtag for miles not really hiked.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All hikes must be done IN the state of Washington  but ANY letterboxer is eligible- you don't have to be a resident of Washington to participate. Trail miles earned in each participating state count toward that state's particular pathtag and cannot be added to another state's count. Pathtags can be earned by family or individually. It is your choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A pathtag patch can be purchased now to show others that you are participating in the pathtag program and when you have earned your pathtag, you can add the pathtag to the center of the patch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Pathtags can be earned for reaching milestones of 25 miles, 50 miles, and 100 miles. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Pictures of the pathtag and patch can be found here: http://www.atlasquest.com/gallery/viewalbum.html?gAlbumId=2257 <br>
<br>

The easiest way to get an answer to your question is to contact the planter of the box and see if they can help you start your quest. Letterboxers are pretty helpful when it comes to someone having trouble locating their box or ciphering the clues. <br>
<br>
Happy Hunting!<br>

Welcome to letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Some clues give you very simple directions to the letterbox, others are more like a puzzle. <br>
I just looked at the clue for that box.  There is a very good hint to the name of the park in the clue.  If you don't know the answer to the hint to the park's name, a quick google search should help you out.<br>
<br>
Figuring out the letterbox clues is a great deal of the fun!  Enjoy your new hobby!<br>

      Hello Jessi and welcome to Letterboxing!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The easiest way to get an answer to your question is to contact the planter of the box and see if they can help you start your quest. Letterboxers are pretty helpful when it comes to someone having trouble locating their box or ciphering the clues. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting!<br>

When you get your 25 miles, email Camp Fire Lady for the address to send your $3.00 (for each tag) and a SASE and you will receive your tag!! List should include date, mileage, boxes found but is not necessary. This is an honor system and I would think you would not want to cheat yourself by acquiring your pathtag for miles not really hiked.<br>

Trail miles earned in each participating state count toward that state's particular pathtag and cannot be added to another state's count. Pathtags can be earned by family or individually.
