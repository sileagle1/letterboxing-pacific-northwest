toward a letterbox. Yesterday evening, we went to search for one in <br/>
a relatively small, old park. As we were arriving, three people were <br/>
leaving. I didn't see any sort of pack for carrying LB supplies, so <br/>
I figured it was just a coicidence that we were in the same park at <br/>
the same time. <br/>
<br/>
When my children and I went to put our stamps in the first logbook, <br/>
we noticed that one other set of people had been to the same box the <br/>
very same day. Could it have been the people we had just seen?....I <br/>
doubt it, but it was fun to wonder.<br/>

BTW, If I remember correctly, I think it was Team Chaos who had <br/>
visited the same set of boxes.<br/>
