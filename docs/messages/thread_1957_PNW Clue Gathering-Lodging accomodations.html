Hi! Sandi and I (both women) will be traveling quite a distance to <br/>
come to this gathering and so we will be getting a hotel room but <br/>
with the cost of gas and food and other little expenditures, we are <br/>
trying to cut costs wherever we can. So we figured maybe if we hit it <br/>
off real well with another female(s) letterboxer who has also <br/>
travelled quite a distance and needs a hotel room we can split the <br/>
cost of a 2 bed hotel room. Sorry guys, you're not invited here hehe <br/>
So anyways, no one needs to reply to this posting to invite <br/>
themselves because we would like to meet you first. Just keep in <br/>
mind, if you need a hotel room and meet us at the gathering and like <br/>
us enough to put up with us for one night feel free to ask us if you <br/>
might want to share a hotel room. <br/>

You might consider staying at the hostel at McMenamins Edgefield. <br/>
http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=3&amp;id=106  Amanda raves about<br/>
how wonderful it is and when she was there, nobody else was there so<br/>
they (her and her sister) essentially had their own room!<br/>

I was going to suggest a hostel, as well.  We recently stayed in <br/>
several around CA and had great experiences--one was a lighthouse <br/>
and another was a gorgeous renovated Victorian mansion!  I'm even <br/>
considering staying in one in Portland tomorrow in anticipation of <br/>
the event on Saturday.  dvn2r ckr<br/>

for that hotel right now. And as for hostels, Im sure it is gonna <br/>
sound hllarious, but for some reason I never in my whole thought-<br/>
filled life realized that USA had hostels too haha I thought only <br/>
other countries had those.. ohh how funny...  :o)<br/>
