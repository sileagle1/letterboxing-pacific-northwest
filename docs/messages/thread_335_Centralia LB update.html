Thanks for the nice verse.  The message is obvious, but the presentation is<br>
great!<br>
<br>
I did find my 'notes' for the 'easy' route to the chafing dish.  I did err<br>
(much to everyone's surprise, I am sure).  I had writted 70 as the distance.<br>
As I usually measure in paces (2 steps) that is what I assumed I had done.<br>
No such luck, it was probably steps.  Look for the upright roots on the<br>
left, then look right just beyond them.  I did update the info in the clues.<br>
<br>
I would likely have taken 60 steps if I was trying to keep up with rnrB, but<br>
without that, my step is likely shorter.<br>
<br>
On the way UP the hill, I wasn't sure if I had gone up the steps or not, it<br>
turns out I hadn't.  I know, pay attention!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Mummsy was not there.  She is enthusiastic, but does not walk too well.<br>
Went to Harry Fain Park.  We made it all the way to the first box, and she<br>
was done in.  Stood in the playground and looked to see where the clues<br>
went, then I went and got the box.<br>
<br>
Took the grandkids to an Easter Egg Hunt.  Alexis picked up a ball, when she<br>
bit into it it was a paint ball.  Was more worried about having done<br>
something wrong than telling us what she had done.  Called the consulting<br>
nurse, who said that the paint was not hazardous but to wash her mouth out<br>
real well.<br>
<br>
The park is very nice; great trees and markers, many birds, not too far from<br>
civilization, but a high degree of steepness (at least for some of us :-)<br>
<br>
Saw your new stamps, they are great!<br>
<br>
See you on the trials, Fudrick<br>
<br>
