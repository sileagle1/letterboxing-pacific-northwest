                    <div class="plaintext-content">Seahunter & I went down to the beach this weekend for a lovely stay in the Astoria area.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to do any letterboxing because I brought the clues for all of Oregon and Washington EXCEPT the Oregon coast clues (boo hoo).  While I was at Fort Stevens complaining that I just KNEW there was a letterbox somewhere in the park and wondering if I could possibly find it without clues (I'm nothing if not hopeful), Seahunter pointed out that there was a letterboxer asking someone for directions over by the museum.  <br>
<br>
Thinking he was just trying to get me to shut up about not bringing the clues, I casually strolled over to check and found a letterboxer asking one of the park employees to help her solve the clues to the box!  She had her clues spread out on the table and they were reading them together.  I couldn't figure out whether to be appalled or impressed by this.  What do you guys think?  I always thought that you were supposed to be casual and unobtrusive in hunting for boxes.  This really seems to go against the unofficial letterboxers creed.<br>

Letterboxing is supposed to be secretive, I like it that way and I hope<br>
things like you ran into Bookworm aren't happening very often or I'm afraid<br>
more boxes will start coming up missing. <br>
