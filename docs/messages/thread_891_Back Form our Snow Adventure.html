the Crooked River Ranch Series Box #2, Steelhaed Falls.<br>
It was snowing the whole way and we hiked through <br>
1" to 1 1/2"  of snow. The kids had a ball! <br>
If you ever get to come to Central Oregon you have<br>
to come and get this box. The views and scenery were awesome!<br>
I think it was even prettier in the snow. (If you are going to get this<br>
 in the snow 4x4 or traction required).<br>
We had a GREAT time, thanks to Funhog for a wonderful LB.<br>
I've been wanting to see these falls for quite some time now.<br>
We are going back in the spring.<br>
Later,<br>
