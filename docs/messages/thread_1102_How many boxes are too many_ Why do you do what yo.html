How many boxes in a given area is too many? Can their actually be too many?<br>

I've had this question on my mind since my first letterboxing experience, a 'moderate' hike using tree roots to pull myself up to Rattlesnake Ledge. I'm still trying to suck in air years later.

As to # of Letterboxes -- I figure as long as they're still being<br>
visited, it's not too many :).<br>
<br>
Ease (or difficulty) of climb, urban/not urban, close to town/miles away<br>
-- these all add into it.  There are 6 boxes (that I know of) at St.<br>
Edwards.  Could it host more?  Probably -- but 6 is the current load.<br>
All are being visited.  There are 9 more up at Bastyr (ok, arguably the<br>
same property) -- but those 9 are there for a very specific reason<br>
(compass practice for Y camp and any other beginners who want the<br>
practice).  They are very close together because the compass work is the<br>
point (not the hike).  They are on trails that could (almost) handle a<br>
stroller all the way -- so it's great for families that have both much<br>
younger and much older folks who want to participate.<br>
<br>
So that's 15 in (arguably) 1 park.  Too many?  Apparently not as they're<br>
all still getting visits :).<br>
<br>
There's my 2 cents...<br>

I for one would like not only to have your opinion but also your X <br>
mark in my log book.  I really hope that you consider making a non-<br>
cognito appearance at the Pt on the 29th.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">> How many boxes in a given area is too many? Can there actually be <br>
too many?<br>
<br>
In the event of a multi-letterbox series, I prefer longer treks <br>
between multiple letterboxes in a series--ie enough to make it worth <br>
putting the 50lb baby backpack (baby & 'stuff' incl) back on in <br>
between events.  I've also grown to prefer outings of 1-3 letterboxes <br>
within a series--because any more than that seems to be overwhelming <br>
(with letterboxes spaced about a 1/2 to 1 mile apart--mostly because <br>
I'm in the hobby for the exercise & the brain exercise of trying to <br>
successfully follow the clues) and I start to find the stamping in <br>
aspect of it rather cumbersome if the distance between two boxes <br>
doesn't even elevate your heart rate.<br>
<br>
Yes, places can become saturated with boxes.  I'm sure saturation is <br>
defined totally differently by various people.  <br>
<br>
CT = saturation  <br>
<br>
PNW = pleasantly sporadic with pockets of accumulated <br>
condensation/puddles<br>
<br>
Doesn't Dartmoor set the definition, though?  What are the current <br>
estimates for Dartmoor?  I've heard that within a 200 sq mile area <br>
there are around 2,000-5,000 known letterboxes (with several hundred <br>
more 'unpublished' ones that this paeon will never have the privilege <br>
of learning about).  Using that as a guide, then CT is barely <br>
moist... <br>
<br>
However, if the goal of a letterbox is to teach somebody something <br>
significant about the area or to introduce them to something they <br>
ordinarily (without knowledge of the area or letterboxing) would not <br>
have known about the region, then that drives me to personally place <br>
a letterbox.  Of course, in these comments I know I have a few boxes <br>
that don't meet these criteria but, for the most part, that's what <br>
drives me to place a letterbox in a region.  Generally, that's why I <br>
prefer to place historically based letterboxes (or at least that's <br>
what I strive to do--if I accomplish that, then that's another story).<br>
