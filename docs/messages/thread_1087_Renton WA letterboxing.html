                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, I was in Renton and visited the "Ouch" letterbox and <br/>
the "Don't Feed the Ducks" letterbox. Both are doing fine and are in <br/>
need of more visitors! <br/>
<br/>
The Don't Feed the Ducks location is a lovely lakeside walk and I <br/>
highly recommend it, plus the stamp is super cute.<br/>
<br/>
The Ouch letterbox is one of the many of the Outlaw Tracey Letterbox <br/>
Series  and is worth a find just to walk over the old trestle bridge! <br/>
<br/>
I also did maintenance on the Kubota Gardens Letterbox today, so it <br/>
has a new, dry box. <br/>
