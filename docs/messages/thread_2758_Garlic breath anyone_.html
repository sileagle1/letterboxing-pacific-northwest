sometimes a person can't tell themselves you know...  Anyhow, I was<br/>
looking through my log book in bed last night thinking about how much<br/>
fun seeing new friends and old was last night not even aware of that<br/>
garlic smell in the last.  This morning we sit down to work and he<br/>
says "did you have garlic last night?"  - whoo-boy, did we have<br/>
garlic!  I said well I didn't have the garlic fries, but there were<br/>
some nearby, must have been enough to infect me, unless it was in my<br/>
salad along with the smelly onions. Sure was worth it, though - I hope<br/>
to see more of Team Shroom and MonkeyBoy locally on the trail, and I<br/>
really enjoyed meeting Prebox and hearing a little about Colorado and<br/>
Denver.  My daughter lives there, so just one more excuse to save up<br/>
and visit.  And of course it's always nice to see those who come from<br/>
far away too.  Great seeing y'all!  I'll try to hold my breath today,<br/>
but I think it's coming out my pores, not that it bothers ME!<br/>
