2004 and T-shirt temperatures. Furthermore, Letterboxing Notables from Northern <br>
climes were visiting. Put it all together and Saturday was the perfect time to hit Smith <br>
Rock SP, along with a gazillion rock climbers. The three boxes there are all in fine <br>
condition but my Mariposa Lily is very lonely. We also visited the two entries in <br>
Redmond's Sam Johnson Park in the late afternoon. <br>
<br>
Today, another trio of letterboxes was on the program. We went to Tetherow <br>
Crossing and found all of these boxes in good shape. The water in the river was high <br>
and everything is turning that wonderful shade of green that is so special in the <br>
desert.<br>
<br>
When I got home this evening, I first checked to see if any new boxes had been <br>
placed in the area over the weekend. That's when I discovered birder's latest <br>
contributions. Then, I looked at the Talk List and saw that the Fleshman's had been to <br>
these new boxes this very day! I only wish we had gone there today, too. It would <br>
have been way fun to run into them, blood and all, on the trail. That sort of encounter <br>
is highly unlikely in this part of the state but my fingers are crossed that it'll happen <br>
someday. Funhog<br>
