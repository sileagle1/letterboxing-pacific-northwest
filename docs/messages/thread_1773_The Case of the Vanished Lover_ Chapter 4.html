Chapter 4<br>
<br>
By the time I left the museum and library it was almost 5:00pm and it<br>
was already mostly dark.  The sun seems to not want to hang around<br>
this time of year and makes for some drearily short days.  The drizzle<br>
was turning to a half hearted rain. The old seaman had left, the<br>
scattered crumbs of bread left among the white splotched paving stones<br>
in front of the museum the only evidence of his prior presence.  The<br>
gulls having got all there was had moved off to bother other people<br>
for handouts, the only evidence of their presence- the splotches.<br>
<br>
I drove back to the center of town and up by the Capitol to see if I<br>
could catch my FBI contact by the federal building.  It was a Saturday<br>
but that never stopped the Bureau from doing business.  My friend had<br>
recently been promoted to head up a small group of agents and he<br>
sometimes handled the payroll processing for his group on Saturdays<br>
mid month. <br>
<br>
Actually we were not friends at all, we just tolerated one another and<br>
sometimes shared information when it was mutually beneficial. We had<br>
met while investigating the same case about 5 years ago.  I had been<br>
hired by an insurance company to investigate a possible fraud on a<br>
fire claim by a local restaurant.  The Bureau was investigating a<br>
money laundering operation that had reportedly been going on in the<br>
same restaurant.  I discovered that the owner of the restaurant had<br>
fled the state to Illinois just after he cashed the insurance check<br>
and had hooked up with the Chicago mob.  George Masser, my counterpart<br>
in the Bureau had tracked down a twice convicted pyro who had been<br>
hired by the restaurant owner to torch the building.  I gave Masser<br>
the location in Illinois where the restaurant owner had fled and he<br>
gave me the information on the torcher.  The Bureau was able to pick<br>
up the restaurant owner in Chicago and convict him of organized crime<br>
activities and I was able to prove arson to the insurance company. <br>
Masser got a commendation, I got a 5% recovery fee from the insurance<br>
claim.  Masser didn't like private investigators at all, he feels they<br>
are all disingenuous interlopers on his domain.  Freelance detectives<br>
unworthy of a badge that mostly got in the way of official<br>
investigations in his eyes. Truth is, no single investigator, whether<br>
private, municipal, or federal can cover every angle.  Sometimes we<br>
need each other as this case with the restaurant owner proved.  It<br>
proved it to me anyway. I take help wherever I can find it.  Masser<br>
had a different way of looking at it.<br>
<br>
I drove by the parking lot of the federal building.  There were five<br>
cars in the lot.  All of them nondescript black Oldsmobuick sedans. <br>
Masser had been moved to the third floor with his promotion to<br>
supervisor.  I saw that one office was still lit on the third floor. <br>
I made a u-turn and parked along the street opposite the parking lot<br>
and waited.  I figured that he would not work past 5:30, what federal<br>
employee ever does, even a Bureau employee and especially on a<br>
Saturday?  I watched the lit office and soon I saw the figure of a man<br>
retrieving a coat and hat from a rack next to the window and then the<br>
light went out.  A few minutes later at precisely 5:33pm George Masser<br>
appeared on the side walk next to the federal building and walked<br>
toward the parking lot.  I pulled my car into the parking lot and<br>
intercepted him before he crossed to his vehicle.<br>
<br>
I rolled down the window and leaned out. "Agent Masser, can I have a<br>
word with you?"<br>
<br>
"It's after 5:30 Stealthboxxer.  I have an appointment with a steak<br>
and a cold beer. I don't have time for your amateur detective<br>
nonsense.  You better make this quick."<br>
<br>
"What do you know about a strange little lonely lady who recently lost<br>
her man and can't seem to find him? Has the local Bureau been<br>
contacted by such a woman about a missing person in the last couple of<br>
months?  This lady would be wearing a very old dress and a black cloak<br>
and sound like a real Victorian lady."<br>
<br>
"Oh, so you've taken the case of Miss Lonely Heart, have you? Seems<br>
about right for you, Stealthboxxer, a hopeless case for a hapless sap.<br>
 Yeah that broad showed up here about 3 days ago demanding the Bureau<br>
investigate the possible kidnapping of her boyfriend.  She claimed<br>
that the captain of some ship had taken him away from her and she<br>
`simply shalln't live without him.'  She actually said that."<br>
<br>
"Your guys get anywhere in the investigation?"<br>
<br>
"Are you kidding?  That dame was a nut case.  She wouldn't even tell<br>
us the name of the man she was looking for.  She never stopped crying<br>
the whole time she was here so I figured she was some crazy bird that<br>
had escaped from Western State Insane Asylum.  I had one of my guys<br>
escort her to an interrogation room while I called up there to<br>
Steilacoom to see if she fit the description of anyone who had broken<br>
out.  She didn't fit any descriptions of escapees so I advised her to<br>
see a doctor and sent her away."<br>
<br>
"So you didn't find her story credible at all?"<br>
<br>
"Look, Stealthboxxer, you may have time to play hide and seek with<br>
some crazy dame but the Bureau has real business to investigate.  You<br>
are some sucker, Stealthboxxer. I hope you you're not expecting to be<br>
paid by that looney. Hah, hah!  Looney!  Like I said, I have a dinner<br>
date and I'm already late so if you will excuse me"<br>
<br>
"Alright, Masser, enjoy your steak."  He walked off and got in his<br>
car. I wasn't about to tell him that she had already paid me $900 in<br>
gold coins.  I wasn't about to tell him about what I had uncovered<br>
about the Geraldson Corporation and the Escalate either.  There didn't<br>
seem to be anything illegal going on so far as I could tell and since<br>
the Bureau wasn't looking for this lost man there was nothing they had<br>
that could help me right now and there was also no need for me to give<br>
them any information on what I had found out.  I could always get<br>
Masser involved later if I needed to.  He was always looking for a way<br>
to impress his superiors. If I discovered anything illegal and tipped<br>
Masser off on it he would end up looking like a hero in his bosses'<br>
eyes. That's how our relationship worked, you scratch my back, I<br>
scratch yours.<br>
<br>
I drove over to the local market and picked up some groceries to take<br>
to my apartment.  I had been living off of canned sardines and stale<br>
saltine crackers for the last week and having some decent food in the<br>
place sounded good for a change.  The market was about halfway up the<br>
hill on the east side of town. Fresh oranges were in from California<br>
and there were a few without mold.  I picked out a half dozen good<br>
ones. I picked up a slab of bacon and a dozen eggs, a few cans of<br>
beans, a pound of stew meat, some carrots, potatoes, celery and a<br>
couple of onions. I got a half pound bag of ground coffee, a half<br>
gallon of milk, and a loaf of bread. All for about $6.50.  Enough for<br>
a few days for one man. <br>
<br>
On the way back to my place I stopped by Lu Tan's cleaners.  Mr. Tan<br>
only kept his shop open till 3pm on Saturdays but I saw that the<br>
lights were on upstairs where he and his family lived in the apartment<br>
above his shop so I decided to pay him a personal visit.  He was angry<br>
at first for disturbing his dinner but the $20 gold piece changed his<br>
tone and he smiled as he led me downstairs to his shop and retrieved<br>
my laundry.  My bill was only $8 but I let him keep the change as a<br>
sort of interest payment and advance payment on my next cleaning.  Mr.<br>
Tan and I had an interesting relationship: he would do my cleaning and<br>
I would pay him about once a month and get my clothes back when I<br>
could afford to.  He didn't seem to mind too much as long as I paid<br>
him a little extra for his troubles.<br>
<br>
I arrived back at my apartment and checked to see if the landlord was<br>
still on the hunt.  The light was out in his apartment by the front<br>
entrance and his car was not there. Likely he got some money from my<br>
neighbor and was out to dinner with his wife. I went up to my place on<br>
the third floor and put my groceries away in the icebox. I tuned the<br>
radio to some jazz and made a pot of stew.  After eating my dinner I<br>
made a pot of coffee and got out my notes on the investigation so far.  <br>
<br>
This Geraldson Corporation was something of a mystery.  How could a<br>
large corporation that obviously had so many holdings stay so low<br>
profile.  If what I found was true it looked as though R.J.Geraldson<br>
had managed to find gold in California and Alaska a year or more<br>
before others did and well before the official gold rushes occured and<br>
masses of people flooded the gold fields.  With a head start like that<br>
they must have excavated more gold than any other mining group in both<br>
locations.  With that much gold coming in they would have been one of<br>
the largest and richest mining companies in the world. Yet, still,<br>
they were relatively obscure.  No history books I had ever read<br>
mentioned them at all. Indeed, a mystery.  And one I would surely<br>
investigate further.<br>
<br>
And what of Sam McGaw?  Who was this captain of the 19th century<br>
Escalate and how did he figure into the Geraldson picture.  He<br>
obviously left the Escalate at some time and started that logging<br>
operation out of Bordeaux with Geraldson's money. What prompted him to<br>
go into the logging business? And how did he, or more likely, his<br>
descendant of the same name, come to be captain of the modern<br>
Escalate?  What did McGaw have to do with Dravus Limited beyond being<br>
the captain of their ship?  <br>
<br>
Boiling down all of these mysteries still left me with one question:<br>
what did all of these involvements with Geraldson, Dravus, McCaw and<br>
gold mining and logging have to do with this nameless lost man? I was<br>
beginning to feel like Masser was right, this case was hopeless.  How<br>
could I possibly find this man without even a name.  Maybe he was<br>
connected to all of this Geraldson stuff, who knows.  But without a<br>
name I was just digging up mole holes.  Sure, I was uncovering loads<br>
of dirt, but I wasn't really finding anything important to the case as<br>
far as I could tell.  <br>
<br>
I decided that I would continue the investigation in the direction I<br>
was headed until either the money ran out or I found something solid.<br>
Miss Lonely Heart had said that she would be back in one week. Maybe<br>
she could give me some real information to realte to what I had<br>
discovered myself.  At least a name.  And, maybe, if she wanted me to<br>
continue the investigation after she heard what I had found so far she<br>
would pay me more money.  <br>
<br>
Regardless, tomorrow was Sunday and even private investigators need a<br>
day of rest.  I decided to take a day off from the case and spend some<br>
time on personal matters.  I decided to make a drive down to Chehalis<br>
and visit my grandfather.  I would start fresh on the case again on<br>
Monday morning with a visit to the regional offices of Geraldson<br>
Corporation.<br>
