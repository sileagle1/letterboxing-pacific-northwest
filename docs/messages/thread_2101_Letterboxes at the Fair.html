interesting you mention it.  I've been talking to the 4-H coordinator about <br/>
placing one-way boxes in each barn at the Island County Fair as a way to <br/>
educate the public as they get to know the barns and the animals there.  In <br/>
the past, they've had this little passport that the kiddies get stamped in <br/>
each barn, and turn in for a prize at the end.  But the problem is, they <br/>
rush into the barn, get the stamp from the person on duty, and then leave <br/>
for the next barn without stopping to see where they are.  We thought <br/>
letterboxes with good clues would be a great educational tool, and fun on <br/>
top of it.<br/>
<br/>
You could check down there and see if a similar situation would work fo you. <br/>
Because of the crowds, we were thinking we'd place them somewhere in the <br/>
barn where the person on duty knows where it is, but it wouldn't <br/>
accidentally be found by somebody or be in a place that could harm the <br/>
animals. We also thought of giving clues they would find the answers to in <br/>
the barn, and they'd have to have the answers to get the box from the person <br/>
on duty.<br/>
<br/>
It could be fun, and I would certainly look for yours if I were close <br/>
enough.<br/>

every year.. but I haven't made it down yet. So yes, I would do so. <br/>
<br/>
I did a stamp last year for Shrewsbury Renn Faire. I carried it on me and<br/>
posted a description of my garb. Anyone that could find me could receive the<br/>
traveler. I've gotten permission to hide a permanent box there, so this year<br/>
it will be a little easier to get the stamp :)<br/>
