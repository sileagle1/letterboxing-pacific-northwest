 <br>
Wild Goose Chase box #3 is gone.  Will not likely be replaced.  There is a homeless camp in the woods nearby.<br>
 <br>
Makin Tracks - Toad  is gone.  This one will be replaced and the area cleaned up.  Someone had a rowdy picnic or party and didn't pack anything out, beware there are broken bottles all over the area.  It was quite disgusting and worthy of an "eco-rant" regarding non biodegradable human trash.    <br>
 <br>
We will attempt a clean up with gloves and such, replace the box, and also replace the logbook for Cedar Hills Twins box #1 which is full when we are able.  <br>
 <br>
Also note that Cedar Hills Twins #2 is in blackberry territory dress approprietly!<br>
 <br>
Otherwise happy trails! <br>

The Duck Pond is proving to be very high maintainance and we may let this one go. Will advise status as we can.  Sorry about that.<br>
