My first and foremost favorite ideas for letterboxes stem from digging <br/>
into the local history of an area. Then, secondly I like to go for long <br/>
forgotten 'kitsch Americana'--just to keep some of the old 'mod' <br/>
history revived among the public consciousness a bit longer before it <br/>
fades away into oblivion.  Then, finally I get inspired by locations--<br/>
just for their beauty or unique features &amp; usually carve/hide something <br/>
on the spot.  <br/>
<br/>
I read incessantly so I often pore over all sorts of materials for <br/>
inspiration--newspapers, internet, old hiking books, travel <br/>
guides/brochures, maps--you name it.  Sometimes I just find an image <br/>
that I like and think may work well for a letterbox and then eventually <br/>
I'll find the 'ideal' spot for it. I've got an entire photo/negative <br/>
album &amp; another file folder that contains ideas for future stamps or <br/>
impressions of stamps I've already carved. I also have several computer <br/>
files that contain ideas for letterbox images/locations. In contrast, I <br/>
try to avoid 'commercial' type stuff for our letterboxes--TV shows, <br/>
tourist attractions (Disneyland?), copyrighted stuff but do have a <br/>
couple boxes that may fall into this arena because they bear special <br/>
meaning to us, etc.<br/>

events, images I run across that just jump out at me, people, places,<br/>

Lately Ive been inspired more and more by historical events that my class<br/>
is studying or has studied. Watch this summer for some boxes on Ancient<br/>
Greece :-)<br/>
