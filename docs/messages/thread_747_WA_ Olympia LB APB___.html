&gt; and unlikely that anybody would accidentally stumble upon this <br/>
&gt; letterbox.  I'm not sure how else to request a letterboxer to take <br/>
&gt; extra care when looking for a letterbox to not reveal its location <br/>
&gt; to passersby--as we were quite forthright in the clues to be <br/>
&gt; discreet from the beginning.  Please if you know anything about <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; letterbox, please contact me right away.  I'm debating whether or <br/>
&gt; not to create a replacement letterbox--leaning more toward not <br/>
&gt; replacing it because the hiding spot has been comprimised. Too bad <br/>

hidden <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just recieved as a birthday gift a nifty little handheld GPS unit.<br/>
Up until the last year, the only reason I would have ever wanted to <br/>
have one would be for fishing, hiking, and general navigation <br/>
purposes.  I am a tried and true letterboxer but geocaching does <br/>
appeal to me too.  I have stumbled on 2 of them and have followed <br/>
clues to a letterbox that was hidden very close to another.  The <br/>
trinkets are not interesting to me (although my kids really like the <br/>
idea of trading junk) but the idea of the treasure hunt is, almost <br/>
as much as letterboxing.  I may even place some caches myself.  <br/>
However, I think that if I do, I will make them more like <br/>
letterboxes- mystery clues that you have to solve, perhaps by <br/>
visitng other sites in the general area of the cach in order to get <br/>
the information to fill in the correct coordinates.  That is much <br/>
more challenging in my opinion than just following a pointer on a <br/>
handheld.  I suppose that if I had had a GPS unit in my possession <br/>
when I first heard of letterboxing and geocaching, I would have <br/>
chosen geocaching over letterboxing---in the beginning that is.  I <br/>
still think that letterboxing is more appropriate for kids.  The <br/>
compass navigation, tree and plant identification, cryptogram <br/>
solving, and other research needed to solve clues is much more <br/>
applicable to education than just following a pointer. The gps in my <br/>
opinion is just another tool to be mastered in an overall arsenal of <br/>
tools at our disposal especially in relation to educating my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Another appealing thing about 'caching is that there are many of <br/>
them nearby--I dont have to travel to another county to get my <br/>
treasure hunting fix.  I mean, how many boxes can dvn2rckr place in <br/>
the Olympia area anyway?  I can think of only 2 parks she or myself <br/>
or fudrick hasnt placed in yet.<br/>
<br/>
Taking advantage of all adventures at my disposal,<br/>
