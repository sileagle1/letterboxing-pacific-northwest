                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just recieved as a birthday gift a nifty little handheld GPS unit.<br>
Up until the last year, the only reason I would have ever wanted to <br>
have one would be for fishing, hiking, and general navigation <br>
purposes.  I am a tried and true letterboxer but geocaching does <br>
appeal to me too.  I have stumbled on 2 of them and have followed <br>
clues to a letterbox that was hidden very close to another.  The <br>
trinkets are not interesting to me (although my kids really like the <br>
idea of trading junk) but the idea of the treasure hunt is, almost <br>
as much as letterboxing.  I may even place some caches myself.  <br>
However, I think that if I do, I will make them more like <br>
letterboxes- mystery clues that you have to solve, perhaps by <br>
visitng other sites in the general area of the cach in order to get <br>
the information to fill in the correct coordinates.  That is much <br>
more challenging in my opinion than just following a pointer on a <br>
handheld.  I suppose that if I had had a GPS unit in my possession <br>
when I first heard of letterboxing and geocaching, I would have <br>
chosen geocaching over letterboxing---in the beginning that is.  I <br>
still think that letterboxing is more appropriate for kids.  The <br>
compass navigation, tree and plant identification, cryptogram <br>
solving, and other research needed to solve clues is much more <br>
applicable to education than just following a pointer. The gps in my <br>
opinion is just another tool to be mastered in an overall arsenal of <br>
tools at our disposal especially in relation to educating my kids.  <br>
<br>
Another appealing thing about 'caching is that there are many of <br>
them nearby--I dont have to travel to another county to get my <br>
treasure hunting fix.  I mean, how many boxes can dvn2rckr place in <br>
the Olympia area anyway?  I can think of only 2 parks she or myself <br>
or fudrick hasnt placed in yet.<br>
<br>
Taking advantage of all adventures at my disposal,<br>
