<br/>
To those of you that are on this list and possibly understand the lure of<br/>
this hobby I admit it; I have lied to go letterboxing.  More times than I<br/>
should care to count.  You could almost say my whole letterboxing career has<br/>
been one lie after another.  My DH doesn't get the "looking for Tupperware<br/>
in the woods" thing, so I occasionally have to be inventive when I want to<br/>
get a box.  I went out a few weeks ago to pick up a box on my way to work,<br/>
realized there was another box "right nearby" and called in to work to tell<br/>
them I overslept and I'd be in late.  I've had the odd "appointment" or two<br/>
requiring me to take whole afternoons off of work.  Suspicious headaches<br/>
that are very close to turning in to migraines have happened, too.  I know,<br/>
it's sad, isn't it?  I do try and be creative with my.um.excuses and I<br/>
occasionally just tell the truth so that the boss doesn't get too<br/>
suspicious.  It's hard to come up with a creative lie when you stumble in to<br/>
work 2 hours late, tell them you've overslept or got stuck in traffic, then<br/>
go to your desk and realize you have leaves in your hair or mud all over<br/>
your shoes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm not a pathological liar, but I think a good 12-step program might be<br/>
needed!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not signing this email, so if any of you try to say this email was<br/>
from me I will deny I ever wrote it!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  If you need a good excuse, let me know.  I bet I have a good one!<br/>

Nope--I'd be sent to the slammer if I ever did that WRT work but I have <br/>
altered work related travel plans rather circuitously to shun air <br/>
travel in order to be able to drive to and from the location instead <br/>
(this coming from someone who commuted by air monthly to Seattle from <br/>
Texas for 2 years before I even started boxing).  <br/>
<br/>
My previous office mates thought I was insane every time I begged <br/>
permission to drive to distant locales such as Monterey, Boise, <br/>
Portland or Spokane in lieu of flying.  I'd only be reimbursed the cost <br/>
of the going airfare rate at the time &amp; the travel time was totally <br/>
unpaid so most of those trips were on my own dime but it sure helped us <br/>
tour the Pacific Northwest along the way.  I even twice begged to drive <br/>
to New Orleans from Seattle in lieu of flying but those two requests <br/>
met the file 13 response--DOA--as they totally knew I was insane!!!  We <br/>
flew both times but ended up maxing our time on the ground in order to <br/>
be able to squeeze some boxing time in before we had to return.  Yep, <br/>
we'd caught the bug, too--just had to get creative with our freetime in <br/>
order to maximize our fun time.  ;)<br/>

<br/>
  I'll admit I've flown under the radar for a bit during the day to sneak in some 'boxing.  I drive an average of about 500 miles per week and all over the South Puget Sound Region, so I try and make stops for boxes along the way between sites.  Everybody assumes I'm at a site for somebody else or something and doesn't check up on me, and I'm certainly not going to offer up information.  Nobody asks, as it is, where exactly I was all day.  Even if they did, simply saying I stopped for a break for lunchtime at an outdoorsy place that's not a noisy construction site, the earthy types I work with will be able to identify readily.  I might omit the whole box aspect, though...so I guess that's lying by omission?<br/>
<br/>
  I got some suspicious looks from a park ranger once while in my work truck, though.  I think she wondered what was in the box in the back of the pickup, since it had radioactive symbols all over it...haha!<br/>
