Salmon Creek Greenway Trail Closing for Repairs Starting October 1<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clark County Public Works will close the Salmon Creek Greenway Trail for<br/>
four days starting this week. The trail will be closed between Northwest<br/>
36th Avenue in Felida and the pond just west of the Vancouver Girls Softball<br/>
Association fields.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The closures are necessary so park maintenance crews can repair sections of<br/>
the asphalt trail damaged by tree roots. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The trail will be closed from approximately 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on each of the<br/>
following days:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday, October 1<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, October 2<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday, October 7<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday, October 8<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The trail will be open to the public outside these dates and times. However,<br/>
the pavement will be in various stages of removal and resurfacing and<br/>
walkers and riders should use caution. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The pavement repair work is dependent on a number of factors, including<br/>
weather, and may be rescheduled if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For more information about the closure or the repair work, please contact<br/>
Clark County Public Works Maintenance and Operations at (360) 397-2446.<br/>
