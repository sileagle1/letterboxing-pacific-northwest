unto others, I thought I would share a wonderful story with you all:<br/>
<br/>
I had planted A Box of Chocolates in a small park in Pleasant <br/>
Valley, WA near Vancouver. I had gotten numerous reports that it was <br/>
missing and that there was another box in it's place which of course <br/>
wasn't one of mine. In this park is a small creek approximately 30 <br/>
feet away from where my box was hidden and that posed no threat <br/>
whatsoever as to the box being swept away. I am assuming that my box <br/>
had been tossed into the creek. Anyway, I got an email the other <br/>
night from a fisherman who had been doing some fishing in Salmon <br/>
Creek. He told me that he had found my box stuck in a hard to reach <br/>
log jam. He fished out my letterbox and was kind enough to research <br/>
the letterboxing.org site so he could return my box to me. I met up <br/>
with him at a Park and Ride parking lot where he returned my <br/>
letterbox in very good condition I might add and told me that this <br/>
hobby sounded very interesting to him and that it might be something <br/>
he and his kids might be interested in doing. We chatted for a bit <br/>
and then went our seperate ways. It is the generousity of strangers <br/>
like this fisherman that make the holidays and letterboxing for that <br/>
matter, all the more meaningful to me.<br/>
Needless to say, I have pulled the clues for A Box of Chocolates so <br/>
whoever has their box planted in this spot might want to post their <br/>
own clues to their box. I will relocate my box somewhere else as <br/>
soon as I find a spot. Happy Holidays and Happy Trails to you all!<br/>
