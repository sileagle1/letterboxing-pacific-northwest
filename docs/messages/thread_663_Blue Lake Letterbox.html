                    <div class="plaintext-content">I, too, was part of that letterboxing Dream Team that included Funhog,<br/>
Ryan, Amanda from Seattle and some of the members of the travelling<br/>
circus.  The clues, of course, you have to sort of decipher beforehand<br/>
so, as you can guess, I just tagged along.  I did sort of help seek it<br/>
out once we were there, though.  We all sort of fanned out and paced it.<br/>
Eventually there was success, but it's not a quick grab, that's for<br/>
sure.  <br/>
<br/>
I re-carved the original stamp that went missing many years ago, but<br/>
never put it in the new letterbox.  I figured that the stamp he put in<br/>
the new box was a replica of the old one...NOT EVEN.  Maybe I should do<br/>
that.  It is Der Mad Stamper's design.  BUT...can I find it again???<br/>
That's the question.  Yeah, it's a tough one.  Not too many people have<br/>
the original stamp in their logbooks.  Or maybe I should place a new<br/>
letterbox in the park with the old Der Mad Stamper Design but with<br/>
Paisley Orca pathetically easy clues. What do y'all think?<br/>

None of us like coming up empty handed, but I believe it is one of <br/>
the hazzards of the sport.  Perhaps, if it bugs ppl that much, they <br/>
should only try for boxes that are new and reported there. And pass <br/>
by the older more questionable boxes to begin with. I was fully aware <br/>
that it could be gone, look at the date it was placed!  When we <br/>
decided to look we knew it would be a challenge.  Please let me <br/>
clairfy we weren't mad after searching for it, I am ready to go look <br/>
again if someone had said they knew it was there! We searched <br/>
everywhere for almost an hour with 5 adults.  So before we called it <br/>
a goner, that's why I posted here for new info.  No worries!  I will <br/>
take a box replacement with new or old clues, I am game!  Wingnut<br/>

oh, and the walk there would be fine for children, searching deep in <br/>
some areas of the bushes might not be so great, but the perimiter and <br/>
some places would work for kids I think?<br/>
