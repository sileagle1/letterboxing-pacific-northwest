When we are out and about, the Red Soup team consists of me Jen, my fianc Mitch and sometimes my daughters Katie and Emily.<br>

Online, Red Soup is almost 100% me (Jen). I'm the one that does the recording and finding of clues, the others come along for the hunt. I'm also the one who does the postals.<br>

I think the girls will pick there own names this summer when we can box outside again properly.<br>

I have several letterboxing dreams, I would love to take a road trip throughout  the PNW States and go boxing, I would love to go to Stone Mountain, and I would really LOVE to go to Dartmoor Park in England.<br>

Happy Boxing,<br>

If you ever come through Seattle, let us know!<br>
And see if you can come down for the Pirates' Gathering in July - it's<br>
a great park which will have lots of letterboxes (when we're done<br>
planting ;) We're planning stuff for kids of all ages (Pirates have<br>
little ones and we have big ones) and I think it will be lots of fun!<br>

give us a shout. You can visit here. We have an extreme letterbox,<br>
accessible by kayak (or the little motorboat) you can do. <br>
There are a few on your way out here too from the ferry<br>
terminal.(lighthouse park, Grouse moutain, Lynn canyon (Goober Ryan's<br>
BC LB) and more.<br>
There are several in the parks near us. so if you, or others want to<br>
venture out this way. Give us a shout.  Camping in the yard might even<br>
work out.<br>
(really really thinking about the possibility of a summer gathering<br>
again. but will hubby like too)<br>
