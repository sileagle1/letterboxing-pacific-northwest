&gt; I'm so sorry to hear that you missed the series that was planted in <br/>
&gt; Millersylvania by Team Rayvenhaus for the FF2 gathering.  One must <br/>
&gt; question what the "Usual Places" are for clues though as those clues, <br/>
&gt; and others in that park as well, are available in many places.<br/>
<br/>
The only clue from FF2 that we found listed on LbNA or Atlas Quest was the one for <br/>
Hiss as well as those for Bethany's and the Nail Family's boxes. I do not use the WoL <br/>
site as it crashes my browser whenever I attempt to look at it. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I'm not a good critic of  our <br/>
&gt; work, I don't think it's good enough, though I've been told that the <br/>
&gt; Perfect  Peter's Pumpkins series was a awesome series and that the clues <br/>
&gt; were wonderfully written.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't miss them; we just misidentified the creators. We all read the clue pamphlet <br/>
and got the impression that the Pumpkins were created by Iron Bear and Pandora. <br/>
They are wonderful and you deserve credit for a job well done. I will have to go back <br/>
and change the labels in my logbook. Funhog<br/>

doubt they will ever be posted in more "usual" means -- Bear and I are<br/>

<br/>
It's funny you mentioned that, because we did have a bit of trouble<br/>
finding ONE of those boxes.  =)  (We didn't find the others at all.) <br/>
We knew that at least one of the clues in the book weren't very good,<br/>
but none of us could remember which one it was.  So we tried all the<br/>
clues and finally figured, after much debate on the proper direction<br/>
to head, that must have been the problem clue.  We wandered around for<br/>
quite awhile anyhow--I was plenty ready just to give up at that<br/>
point--and Jennifer says something like, "Well, this box is impossible<br/>
to find."  And right on clue, Silent Doug, scrounging around ahead,<br/>
pipes up and says, "I found it!"<br/>
<br/>
We were shocked.  After getting our bearing with that one box, we<br/>
continued on to the next box and thought we were doing pretty well<br/>
until we started beating bushes and trees and nothing fell out.  By<br/>
then it was starting to get dark and we really did call it quits.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, though, lots of fun.  =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep that's about the jest of what we heard from those that looked for it at<br/>
the event. -- It was a lesson learned for Iron`Bear and I - You see<br/>
Iron`Bear drew the stamps, I carved them, and due to me having pneumonia,<br/>
Iron`Bear placed them, took notes and gave them to me and I wrote the clues.<br/>
We even read over them together a couple times, but in the end, what I said<br/>
wasn't what he thought I said, and wasn't what he said in his notes, wasn't<br/>
didn't mean what I thought it did.  That will teach us to ever let one of us<br/>
plant the boxes without the other and then let the absentee planter write<br/>
the clues!<br/>
<br/>
Some lessons are harder on the rest of you then us though :) We could take<br/>
you to the boxes just find LOL.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever decide to go for the Lycan Series, be sure to email Iron`Bear<br/>
for the clues, the stamps are definitely worth while.<br/>
