I have been out of the game for a couple years, but I am working on a new stamp and I am going to start back up again! (along with a bit of geocaching as well).<br>

I got a new letterboxing bag, and I need a new patch! I have the PNW slug patch, but I would like a new Letterboxing patch. Are there any others? Where should I go to buy these?<br>

Hello!<br>
<br>
I have been out of the game for a couple years, but I am working on a new<br>
stamp and I am going to start back up again! (along with a bit of geocaching<br>
as well).<br>
<br>
I got a new letterboxing bag, and I need a new patch! I have the PNW slug<br>
patch, but I would like a new Letterboxing patch. Are there any others?<br>
Where should I go to buy these?<br>
<br>
Thanks, and you will be hearing more from me soon!<br>

<br>
If you are looking for patches specific to the PNW, I have the Washington Letterboxing and Oregon Letterboxing patches available. Here is the link from Atlas Quest:<br>
<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/gallery/viewphoto.html?gPhotoId=68190<br>
<br>
I do not have a picture of the Oregon patch but it is just as beautiful as the Washington patch for the same price.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
