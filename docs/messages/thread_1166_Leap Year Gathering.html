                    <div class="plaintext-content">Me and MomNoTime have planted six boxes in the park this past month. <br/>
I can email you offlist the clues if you want them for Sunday morning <br/>
boxing. I will have the clues entered into the databases by Saturday <br/>
evening though. <br/>
<br/>
I still haven't figured out what I'm going to bring for the potluck. <br/>
My husband (OfficerMAB) is going to meet us at the park around the <br/>
official start time yet I will be there (with MomNoTime most likely) <br/>
early doing some morning boxing...We are still in search of a elusive <br/>
Forest Gnome or two!<br/>
<br/>
I also am hoping to get the third box of my Bowl Series planted this <br/>
weekend...hmm...wonder what bowl could I be thinking of?? A local may <br/>
be able to figure out where a third "bowl" could be located in this <br/>
town. LOL!! Hmm...maybe it will be a Mystery Bowl instead of the <br/>
original bowl name I was thinking of!! Isn't the mystery just driving <br/>
you nuts!! If I am able to get it planted tomorrow I'll bring the <br/>
clues with me to the Event.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone carved out an event stamp? I unfortunately haven't had the <br/>
time to even wipe my nose this past week and haven't been able to <br/>
yet. ALthough...guilt may get the best of me and I'll try to whip one <br/>
out on Saturday night. I would love to see everyone's interpetation <br/>
of "Leap from Fantasy to Frontier" could be as a rubber stamp. <br/>
<br/>
I will say that two of the six boxes we planted were called "The <br/>
Frontier" and "The Fantasy" aka "The F&amp;F Series". So...even if I <br/>
don't get an event stamp carved myself I did carve some stamps <br/>
related to the event.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that the "Hearts Across America" Postal Letterbox was <br/>
going to make it here in time to bring to the event. I received <br/>
permission from it's "owner" to bring it. Alas, due to a midwest <br/>
mailing snafu enroute to its first recepient (Rayvenhaus and I are <br/>
2nd and 3rd on its mailing list) it was sent back to the east coast <br/>
and is a week or so behind schedule. Aw...shucks!! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to see everyone and to see BookWorm again!! Yipee!! I <br/>
missed her last Saturday when we were in Portland with BindleBabe.<br/>
<br/>

this past month.<br/>

What time are you planning on being at the park?  I was thinking of coming <br/>
up early and hoping to hook up with some others... I have some of the clues <br/>
printed out, but not sure if I got them all or not.... I've never been there <br/>
before...<br/>
<br/>
See everyone on Sunday,<br/>
