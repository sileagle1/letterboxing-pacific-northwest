                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was wondering today, as I worked on the database program, why we do things the way that we do? In example, most of the people that I have met thus far letterboxing could be described as the Renaissance type of person. The ones that build things with their hands and are proud of it. On the other hand the majority of the Geocachers strike me as Technogeeks that are more interested in using their technogadgets then in creating something from hand......<br/>
<br/>
Of course, each is in their own right to do what they want, no? However, I remember one simple precept. <br/>
<br/>
"Do what you will, ere it harm none." <br/>
<br/>
I've found that the letterboxing crowd, is, for the most part, a more laid back crowd, more aware of their surroundings and how they affect them, than the Geocaching crowd appears to be. <br/>
<br/>
I know that we both claim the same 'care of the surroundings' and all, but I'm sorry, I've seen the vegetation surrounding the few Geocaches I have stumbled across, and let me tell you, it is a sorry sight. Of course, we end up with the inevitable 'social' trail leading towards our boxes, specially if it is a more frequented box, but, I for one do everything I can to ensure that the land is better off than when I came there. We, Team Rayvenhaus, even go so far as to have the kids carry plastic shopping bags, you know, the ones that we get from the grocery store, with them and RayvenDad gives them a dollar a bag for every bag of trash they carry out of a park, trail or forest. <br/>
<br/>
Let me share two stories with you. The first one is the day that team Rayvenhaus went to walk through the area where our Snow Dogs series is planted. AS we wandered through the forest trails, the kids were gleefully picking up every scrap of litter they could find. Imagine, if you will, the site we made as we emerged from the forest 4 hours later, the RayvenTwins each carrying 3 bags apiece, stuffed full of garbage, RayvenMom carrying the remnants of some 4 different blankets and other assorted cloth items and RayvenDad rolling two tires, one small trailer sized tire complete with rim and one MudStomping, huge treaded monstrosity. As we approached the garbage can, I realized from the fact that it was overflowing with McDonalds bags on the ground and other various trash spread in a 6 foot circle, what we had was not going to fit into the can. So, off we went, loading up the back of the RayvenVan (A highly specialized and modified, Top Secret vehicle designed specifically for letterbox adventures and picnics.... Much like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!) and then returned to the area around the garbage can and proceeded to clean that area up. After about 5 minutes of work I noticed a man approaching from the recreation building with a purposeful stride. I told the family to continue and turned to greet the man. Imagine my surprise at his questions as to why we were stealing the garbage!!!! I am sure that my chin hit the ground when he asked that. A rather interesting conversation ensued as we talked about what we were doing there and why we were doing the groundskeeper's job. When asked that question, I responded with a simple statement, "Well, it looks to me that the groundskeeper isn't doing it, so we thought we'd help." After speaking with the man, it was obvious that he was unprepared for anyone to wander the forest and clean it as they went, that he was more used to people leaving their trash behind that in people picking up others trash. He then pointed to two large dumpsters and said that we were welcome to place the garbage there rather than mess up the vehicle by trying to cart it off ourselves. The man left with an assuredly better outlook on people using the facilities than he had that morning. <br/>
<br/>
The second story concerns meeting some Geocachers on the trail. We had just completed a series of three near DuPont, Wa when, on the return, we came across a group of 4 people, blundering around in the underbrush on both sides of the trail, yelling and hollering about "Where in the ^&amp;%$ is the &amp;*$@*!&amp; thing supposed to be.", etc, etc, etc. We stopped and watched for almost 5 minutes before anyone noticed that we were there, watching as the undergrowth was trampled and literally torn up as they poked and prodded and ripped and torn their way towards locating something. Not one to jump to conclusions, I offered to help then locate whatever it was that they had lost. One of the people returned to the trail to converse with me as the rest of the group continued on the pillage and plunder routine in the underbrush. The person spoke to me, telling me of this wonderful sport they were participating in, called Geocaching, and explained how it worked and what they were trying to find. I enquired if their sport also included destroying the surrounding vegetation whilst searching for the illusive cache. The look of incomprehension on his face made it painfully clear that the jab went unnoticed. We stood there until one of the people in the underbrush shrieked in glee as the unearthed the Geocache. And I mean unearthed as in dug it up. After they had concluded their business and departed, we stood there and surveyed the damage that had been done to the area and, all I can say is that I was reminded of that commercial in the late 1970's of the Native American standing by a Highway, looking over the pollution with a single tear running down his cheek. <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I am not saying that all people who letterbox take care of the environment, nor am I saying that all people who geocache destroy the environment. All I am saying is that one bad apple ruins the barrel, one awwcrappie, wipes out all your attaboys, books are judged by their covers, etc, etc. <br/>
<br/>
And I am saying that everyone one of us Letterboxes need to ensure that we leave a place better than when we found it, that we do everything in our power to be cognitive of our surroundings and take care of what little is left of nature's gift to us. It is, after all, fast disappearing. The one thing to remember is a line from the movie The Matrix..... <br/>
<br/>
Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment. But you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague. <br/>
<br/>
Kinda interesting when you think about it.... Because it is true. We are destroying that which we have and not replacing it. We only get one shot. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that the rantings of this article have not upset anyone, nor caused anyone to think that I am looking down upon them, as I fall into that same group as you do. Human beings. And I am no better than anyone else on this website. My intent in writing this was to perhaps, foster some thoughts about helping to make a location better than when we entered it, to help cleanup the planet one spot at a time. <br/>
<br/>
Until next time. Be well and may you find every box you look for. <br/>

My only hope is that my 7yr old daughter doesn't catch on and ask for <br/>
a dollar a bag...we're into for .50cents a letterbox to help with the <br/>
trash. (Like she really has a choice, haha)<br/>

You may recall the post 9/1 about the article on Geocaching by Sarah Johnson of the Daily Olympian.  She also did the article on BookCrossing with EskieLover (my wife).  If all the LbPNW'rs agree, it may make sense to send this info to Sarah in hopes she will tell the truth about geocaching.  I don't know if she has followed up on the Daily 0 box; she should be made aware of what she caused:<br/>
<br/>
One of the finders  comments and in the log was that one group had bushwhacked in from Harrison Avenue, it was a tough go, but didn't recommend that anyone else try it, due to the damage it would cause to the wetlands.  Well, duh!!  If they were so concerned, why did they do it????<br/>
<br/>
If there is agreement, will contact her with the info, will probably need a box to place with her, for the Daily 0, and some people for a mini-gathering to show her what it is like to find things the eco-friendly way!<br/>
<br/>
Will be in Eastern WA this week, will check in Saturday to see what the consensus is.<br/>

&gt; You may recall the post 9/1 about the article on Geocaching by Sarah<br/>
Johnson of the Daily Olympian.  She also did the article on BookCrossing<br/>
with EskieLover (my wife).  If all the LbPNW'rs agree, it may make sense to<br/>
send this info to Sarah in hopes she will tell the truth about geocaching.<br/>
I don't know if she has followed up on the Daily 0 box; she should be made<br/>
aware of what she caused:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of the finders  comments and in the log was that one group had<br/>
bushwhacked in from Harrison Avenue, it was a tough go, but didn't recommend<br/>
that anyone else try it, due to the damage it would cause to the wetlands.<br/>
Well, duh!!  If they were so concerned, why did they do it????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If there is agreement, will contact her with the info, will probably need<br/>
a box to place with her, for the Daily 0, and some people for a<br/>
mini-gathering to show her what it is like to find things the eco-friendly<br/>
way!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Will be in Eastern WA this week, will check in Saturday to see what the<br/>
consensus is.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I was wondering today, as I worked on the database program, why we do<br/>
things the way that we do? In example, most of the people that I have met<br/>
thus far letterboxing could be described as the Renaissance type of person.<br/>
The ones that build things with their hands and are proud of it. On the<br/>
other hand the majority of the Geocachers strike me as Technogeeks that are<br/>
more interested in using their technogadgets then in creating something from<br/>
hand......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Of course, each is in their own right to do what they want, no? However,<br/>
I remember one simple precept.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   "Do what you will, ere it harm none."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I've found that the letterboxing crowd, is, for the most part, a more<br/>
laid back crowd, more aware of their surroundings and how they affect them,<br/>
than the Geocaching crowd appears to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I know that we both claim the same 'care of the surroundings' and all,<br/>
but I'm sorry, I've seen the vegetation surrounding the few Geocaches I have<br/>
stumbled across, and let me tell you, it is a sorry sight. Of course, we end<br/>
up with the inevitable 'social' trail leading towards our boxes, specially<br/>
if it is a more frequented box, but, I for one do everything I can to ensure<br/>
that the land is better off than when I came there. We, Team Rayvenhaus,<br/>
even go so far as to have the kids carry plastic shopping bags, you know,<br/>
the ones that we get from the grocery store, with them and RayvenDad gives<br/>
them a dollar a bag for every bag of trash they carry out of a park, trail<br/>
or forest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Let me share two stories with you. The first one is the day that team<br/>
Rayvenhaus went to walk through the area where our Snow Dogs series is<br/>
planted. AS we wandered through the forest trails, the kids were gleefully<br/>
picking up every scrap of litter they could find. Imagine, if you will, the<br/>
site we made as we emerged from the forest 4 hours later, the RayvenTwins<br/>
each carrying 3 bags apiece, stuffed full of garbage, RayvenMom carrying the<br/>
remnants of some 4 different blankets and other assorted cloth items and<br/>
RayvenDad rolling two tires, one small trailer sized tire complete with rim<br/>
and one MudStomping, huge treaded monstrosity. As we approached the garbage<br/>
can, I realized from the fact that it was overflowing with McDonalds bags on<br/>
the ground and other various trash spread in a 6 foot circle, what we had<br/>
was not going to fit into the can. So, off we went, loading up the back of<br/>
the RayvenVan (A highly specialized and modified, Top Secret vehicle<br/>
designed specifically for letterbox adventures and picnics.... Much like<br/>
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!) and then returned to the area around the garbage<br/>
can and proceeded to clean that area up. After about 5 minutes of work I<br/>
noticed a man approaching from the recreation building with a purposeful<br/>
stride. I told the family to continue and turned to greet the man. Imagine<br/>
my surprise at his questions as to why we were stealing the garbage!!!! I am<br/>
sure that my chin hit the ground when he asked that. A rather interesting<br/>
conversation ensued as we talked about what we were doing there and why we<br/>
were doing the groundskeeper's job. When asked that question, I responded<br/>
with a simple statement, "Well, it looks to me that the groundskeeper isn't<br/>
doing it, so we thought we'd help." After speaking with the man, it was<br/>
obvious that he was unprepared for anyone to wander the forest and clean it<br/>
as they went, that he was more used to people leaving their trash behind<br/>
that in people picking up others trash. He then pointed to two large<br/>
dumpsters and said that we were welcome to place the garbage there rather<br/>
than mess up the vehicle by trying to cart it off ourselves. The man left<br/>
with an assuredly better outlook on people using the facilities than he had<br/>
that morning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The second story concerns meeting some Geocachers on the trail. We had<br/>
just completed a series of three near DuPont, Wa when, on the return, we<br/>
came across a group of 4 people, blundering around in the underbrush on both<br/>
sides of the trail, yelling and hollering about "Where in the ^&amp;%$ is the<br/>
&amp;*$@*!&amp; thing supposed to be.", etc, etc, etc. We stopped and watched for<br/>
almost 5 minutes before anyone noticed that we were there, watching as the<br/>
undergrowth was trampled and literally torn up as they poked and prodded and<br/>
ripped and torn their way towards locating something. Not one to jump to<br/>
conclusions, I offered to help then locate whatever it was that they had<br/>
lost. One of the people returned to the trail to converse with me as the<br/>
rest of the group continued on the pillage and plunder routine in the<br/>
underbrush. The person spoke to me, telling me of this wonderful sport they<br/>
were participating in, called Geocaching, and explained how it worked and<br/>
what they were trying to find. I enquired if their sport also included<br/>
destroying the surrounding vegetation whilst searching for the illusive<br/>
cache. The look of incomprehension on his face made it painfully clear that<br/>
the jab went unnoticed. We stood there until one of the people in the<br/>
underbrush shrieked in glee as the unearthed the Geocache. And I mean<br/>
unearthed as in dug it up. After they had concluded their business and<br/>
departed, we stood there and surveyed the damage that had been done to the<br/>
area and, all I can say is that I was reminded of that commercial in the<br/>
late 1970's of the Native American standing by a Highway, looking over the<br/>
pollution with a single tear running down his cheek.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Needless to say, I am not saying that all people who letterbox take care<br/>
of the environment, nor am I saying that all people who geocache destroy the<br/>
environment. All I am saying is that one bad apple ruins the barrel, one<br/>
awwcrappie, wipes out all your attaboys, books are judged by their covers,<br/>
etc, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   And I am saying that everyone one of us Letterboxes need to ensure that<br/>
we leave a place better than when we found it, that we do everything in our<br/>
power to be cognitive of our surroundings and take care of what little is<br/>
left of nature's gift to us. It is, after all, fast disappearing. The one<br/>
thing to remember is a line from the movie The Matrix.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium<br/>
with the surrounding environment. But you humans do not. You move to an area<br/>
and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and<br/>
the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another<br/>
organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it<br/>
is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a<br/>
plague.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Kinda interesting when you think about it.... Because it is true. We are<br/>
destroying that which we have and not replacing it. We only get one shot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I hope that the rantings of this article have not upset anyone, nor<br/>
caused anyone to think that I am looking down upon them, as I fall into that<br/>
same group as you do. Human beings. And I am no better than anyone else on<br/>
this website. My intent in writing this was to perhaps, foster some thoughts<br/>
about helping to make a location better than when we entered it, to help<br/>
cleanup the planet one spot at a time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Until next time. Be well and may you find every box you look for.<br/>
