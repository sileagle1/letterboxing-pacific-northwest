near future, please be advised that it was recently vandalized and is <br>
missing it's logbook now (although the stamp is still there--go <br>
figure!).  As I'm not physically able to visit this box for the next <br>
several months, if anybody is happening to pass through the region <br>
and wants to visit the 'quickie I-5 drive by' box, could you please <br>
add a large piece of paper or small notepad to it for folks to log in <br>
during their visits so future visitors won't be disappointed?  <br>
Thanks.  When we're able to return to the area, I'll add a notebook <br>
and modify it's hiding place since it's residence has now officially <br>
been 'compromised'.<br>
