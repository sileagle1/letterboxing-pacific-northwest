Wow, what a difference an "o" makes!  It's a little clearer now.  I<br/>
know someone smarter than me who found these boxes already without any<br/>
help at all - my brain is foggy from working on this one but I think<br/>
I'm getting close.  It's funny how different brains work in different<br/>
ways.  Saturday I found a box that I basically walked right up to with<br/>
no problem and found three or four log-ins telling how hard it was and<br/>
how they had tried multiple times.  I'm not bragging, although I must<br/>
say I felt kind of smug about it, naturally, it's just that everyone<br/>
thinks in a different way when they go about following clues.  That's<br/>
part of the fun!<br/>
