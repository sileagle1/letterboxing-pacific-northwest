Wandered off to where the soccer playing family might not take as much notice.  Opened the log, found that dvn2r ckr had been there that day, just before me.  Logged in, went back to the car, took the now-closed box with me, so as not to show them were it was.  Sitting in the car, studying the clues, when there is a knock on EskieLover's window.  She opens it, a voice says "We are the Letterbox Police, what are you up to!".  It was dvn2r and the whole gang!  They were stumped by number two, we found the location, trkee found the box.  <br/>
<br/>
They said that all the found of the first box was the bottom, they didn't find the top, so they put it back that way.<br/>
<br/>
A nice series, highly recommended!<br/>

Thanks for the compliments on the clues. I take them with high regard <br/>
from you, Fudrick! We found your Kennedy Creek boxes over the weekend-<br/>
 Great fun.<br/>
<br/>
Also want to thank all of you for closing up the box that had the <br/>
missing top/bottom. (How after all, no body wants to be caught with <br/>
their top off, or bottoms missing...Ok. I didn't just write that.) <br/>
Since this is my first post, I better just quit.<br/>
