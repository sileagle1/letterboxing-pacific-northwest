Just went down to Tumalo to check my boxes and get some others. Had some <br>
success but also some disappointment. It seems that several boxes were not <br>
rehidden well and have gone missing. The boxes are;<br>
<br>
Campin' with JR-Tumalo <br>
Tumalo Chipmunk <br>
Springbreak<br>
<br>
I'm sure Campin' with JR is gone and almost positive on the other two as I <br>
found some empty holes just the size for a letterbox. I hope I'm wrong but you <br>
may want to check on your boxes when you can Paisley Orca and Heather.<br>
I also tried for Rattlesnake and had no luck.<br>
I did find Tumalo Mayfly, Tumalo Toadstool and  Say no evil. Thanks to <br>
Kokopelli, Pungent Bob And Amanda from Seattle.<br>
<br>
Great  day for boxing!<br>
Later,<br>
