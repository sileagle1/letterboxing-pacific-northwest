Snicker, snicker.   We are not asking to be pointed to the boxes, we have questioned the eyewitness a couple of times and have come up with nothing new and we have searched the paths taken and not and a few possible "cryptic" clues!  So, now we start digging.   No, offence, but Nancy Drew has an "in" with the placer and is the only one who seems to have found all 6.  Hummm.......<br/>

<br/>
I'll have you know, Nancy Drew is an expert at what she does!  <br/>
Snooping around and causing trouble.  She found all six long before I <br/>
ever met her face-to-face.  Okay, it might have been about two hours <br/>
before I met her face-to-face for the first time, but still, she <br/>
didn't have an "in" when she found all 6.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few others out there that have all six, though I'll admit <br/>
it's not many.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be suprised if one or two boxes were missing by now--it's <br/>
a very well-traveled park and boxes are likely to be found and <br/>
confiscated once in awhile.  I had to replace two of them last year <br/>
and I've been meaning to get back this year to check up.  When I do, <br/>
I'll be sure to announce the results.  But then, they aren't easy <br/>
boxes to find either since I don't lead you directly to them in the <br/>
clues, so it might be the two boxes just haven't been found yet.  In <br/>
a clue of this nature, though, there's no way to confirm whether it <br/>
really is missing or if you just didn't find it.<br/>
