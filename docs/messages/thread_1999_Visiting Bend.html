Hello!<br/>
 We will be vacationing in Bend next week, and I am very excited to go <br/>
letterboxing. Wow, I can't believe how many there are in the area <br/>
(within 30 miles). So I was just wondering if anyone has any <br/>
favorites, must see boxes. I have 2 small children, 1 of which doesn't <br/>
like LB at all (or being in the car). So, I am especially wondering <br/>
about the boxes not in Bend. I also will not have access to the <br/>
internet, so let me know by Saturday please. <br/>
 I can't wait to come up!! Yeah! Thanks to everyone (in advance) for <br/>
all the fun we will have when we are there!<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

Smith Rock is stunning but a little one who doesn't like letterboxing might be <br/>
overwhelmed by some of the hikes. Shoshoni Sun and Smith Rock Golden Eagle are <br/>
the two easiest ones there. Tumalo State Park is quite close to Bend and has quite <br/>
and array of boxes, all easy hikes. There is also a kids' play area close to the <br/>
campground, complete with swings. Most of the others in Bend, with the exception <br/>
of Pilot Butte, are easy hikes with wonderful stamps, beautiful scenery and <br/>
interesting wildlife. The boxes at Newberry Volcanic Monument will take you to see <br/>
some VERY interesting areas. Honestly, you can't go wrong with any of the <br/>
adventures offered by the boxes in this part of our fair state.  Enjoy! Funhog<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Check out the boxes at Smith Rock State Park and at Eagle Crest.<br/>
