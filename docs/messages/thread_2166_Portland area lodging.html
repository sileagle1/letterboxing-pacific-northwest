                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've stayed at the Travelodge in Troutdale rather often.  It was <br/>
the least expensive place listed on Travelocity a while back--which <br/>
is how we learned about it initially.  It's very centrally located <br/>
and perfect if you're interested in the Columbia River Gorge <br/>
waterfalls boxes.  Those boxes alone are worth spending a couple of <br/>
weeks in the region.  It probably costs about $45/night, though--<br/>
which is 'expensive' for us as our goal is usually a hotel room for <br/>
$35 or less (true roach motels).  McMenamins in the Troutdale area <br/>
does have a 'luxury hostel' that runs about $35/night/person, so <br/>
that's an option, too.  Just depends on your price range.<br/>
<br/>
We usually camp along the way and look for campsites under $15/night-<br/>
-although we do splurge occasionally on an $18/night site near Mt <br/>
Rainier that's right along the river.  ;)  We usually stay in hotels <br/>
when the weather gets pretty unbearable for camping and often only <br/>
as a last resort.  So, that gives you an idea on what <br/>
our 'cleaniless' standards are for a hotel room.  I usually prefer <br/>
camping over staying at a hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun in Portland!<br/>
