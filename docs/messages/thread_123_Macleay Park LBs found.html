Orca's Upper Macleay Park Series--and I'm happy to report that Beaver's <br/>
Lunch, Ring-necked Duck &amp; Osprey's Perch are all alive and well (great <br/>
images!)  But hmmm, we couldn't find the White-fronted Bee eater.  It may <br/>
still be there--I was not totally convinced I was ever at the correct snag &amp; <br/>
log, but I did give all in the general vicinity a good going-over.  I'll be <br/>
interested to hear if someone finds this box in the future (or if someone who <br/>
alreasy knows its location checks on it).<br/>
<br/>
Finding Barry's Macleay Park LB helped make up for the one we missed!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you both for showing us a good time!  <br/>
