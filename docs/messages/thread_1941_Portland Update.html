offering in the area. We have to say that Johnson Creek Jigsaw was a<br>
wonderful walk and very fun series. We loved the whole thing. It was a great<br>
way to get Touche' Turtle out for a walk (she just found out she's pregnant,<br>
so we're getting her in shape) and see some new areas. <br>
 <br>
We were the first to stamp into this fun set of boxes, I recommend you take<br>
the time to do so as well! <br>
 <br>
Thank you Blue Rose Gang!<br>
