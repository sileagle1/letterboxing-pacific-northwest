the `Here Comes the Bride & Groom' event at Bridal Veil Falls on <br>
Saturday, 5.24 from 3-6pm.  It's an Oregon wedding reception for Atomic <br>
Beans from Illinois, who are enjoying a letterboxing honeymoon in the <br>
PNW.  <br>
<br>
Don't miss the exchanges, ten (I'll say it again, ten) event stamps <br>
from their letterboxing wedding and some light refreshments.  It will <br>
be a perfect day to enjoy the park's short hiking trails and nice <br>
views.  All we'll be missing is YOU. :)<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for a fabulous letterboxing reception in the PNW everyone!  We <br>
had a great time exploring your neck of the woods.  We found several <br>
boxes while we were out there, so be expecting some "finds" logged <br>
soon. :)  And a BIG thank you to Marmalade for organizing the M&G at <br>
Bridal Veil Falls on Saturday!  The weather and company were perfect.<br>
