The clues for the Count of Monte Cristo box (the clues are inside the <br>
Book Keeper box) are a special version. They will not be reprinted <br>
like they are currently. We (Ladybug and I) wanted to do something <br>
special, but it was rather time consuming and a bit painful, truth be <br>
told. So I guess you could say these clues are limited edition, and <br>
quite nifty if I say so myself. :)<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd let people know.<br>
