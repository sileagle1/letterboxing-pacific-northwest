boxes.  Who could possibly have them all?  So I was desperate <br>
yesterday since I hadn't found a box for several weeks, and Milo <br>
McIver Park near Estacada sounded like a great place to go.<br>
<br>
While searching for Protection, I instead got bit by a Chigger.  What <br>
an unexpected buggy surprise.  Very nice carving Catbead, if you read <br>
this post.  Thanks to Maiden for the nice box.  It's in fine <br>
condition.  <br>
<br>
As are Mi(lo) or Bust by Funhog, and the Clackamas River box by <br>
Paisley Orca.  Thanks both of you for some cool images and a fun <br>
afternoon getting some exercise.  <br>
<br>
Now back to the extensive list of chores that I should have been <br>
working on all day yesterday.....<br>
