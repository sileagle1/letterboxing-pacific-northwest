<br>
Some of you may have seen the announcement for the Dead Horse Postal Box.  I managed to get on the list for it and it should be coming to me in the next 10 days.. <br>
<br>
The box owner has OK'd it to be stamped in by anyone that can make it to the person that has it in possession before the deadline to move it on.  Camp Fire Lady and I have already decided to meet up as soon as I get it so she can stamp in before I move it.  <br>
<br>
If anyone else in interested I'll announce where her and I are going to meet up so anyone else that would like to can also pick up the stamp and stamp in.  <br>
<br>
Anyone interested? <br>
<br>
Melanie<br>
