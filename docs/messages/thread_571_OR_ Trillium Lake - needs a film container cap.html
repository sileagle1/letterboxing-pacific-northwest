                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great location for a series, and your locations and the stamps are adorable!  We were impressed with your log books and stamp creations.  And even tho Hood was hiding behind some clouds, it was a beautiful day, and a very busy lake.  While sitting on the bench and talking about the lid situation and the coming snow, a single cloud formed briefly above the top of Mt. Hood and looked like a caption bubble, alas no words appeared within, but it was kewl to see anyway.<br>
 <br>
Thanks for the wonderful series, and we really liked your hidey places and the stamps that matched!  You might note that there is more than one flower meadow and that was the only one that stumped us at all, once we realized that if we just keep going it all fell right into place.  <br>
