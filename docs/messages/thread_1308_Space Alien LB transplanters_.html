<br/>
It's happened to YOU too???  And I was thinking we were the only <br/>
ones who experienced this problem.  In fact, that's what inspired <br/>
our two HH letterboxes a couple years ago:<br/>
<br/>
"Alien on the Loose" HH  &amp; "yoU. F.O.und it" HH<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if they've since been 'nudged' into oblivion by their <br/>
relatives since we haven't heard from them in years...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Area 51 is much bigger than we all initially thought???<br/>

'an alien believer--ever since we attended the UFO festival in <br/>
Roswell about 5 years ago and saw that slimy little frozen guy all <br/>
snug in the display case in the museum--who could ever possibly <br/>
doubt it???'<br/>

&gt; Yeah, I hate it when space aliens nudge my boxes out of their <br/>
hiding <br/>
