 <br>
That is too bad, we really enjoyed finding those boxes.  <br>
 <br>
 Haven't seen many new boxes from you lately, your boxes are so much fun, will you be planting any elsewhere?<br>
 <br>

A dang good question, Crutchstumper!  I have had a series ready to go for the <br>
loooonngest ridiculous time.  It is about time I got out and placed the darn <br>
things.  <br>
<br>
Sorry to hear of your misstep!  Hope you heal quickly and get back to <br>
stumping without the crutches soon!<br>

P.S. Sure!  I vote you get the Purple Heart--you sustained injury in the line <br>
of letterboxing, after all.<br>
