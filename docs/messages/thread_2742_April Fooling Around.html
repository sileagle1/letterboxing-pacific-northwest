                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings NW Boxers!<br>
<br>
I'll be in Portland visiting family for a long weekend of March 30 to <br>
April 3rd.  My brother doesn't 'box but is very tolerant of working <br>
them in when we're out and about doing other stuff.  I think he <br>
should especially tolerant this trip since April 1st is my birthday - <br>
no fooling! which is the main reason for my visit.<br>
<br>
Last time I visited we did a road trip to the coast and went to the <br>
Portland Zoo where I managed to get all the boxes there except for <br>
that pesky Packy's Place which was hiding out in the lost and found <br>
office about the time we went looking for it.<br>
<br>
I know I'm going to spend time trying for Ace of Fun and most likely <br>
the Musician series boxes which will probably wipe out my <br>
limited 'boxing time.  <br>
<br>
So....Does anyone have any boxes they'd like to suggest besides these <br>
that are relatively easy to get to and which are public transit <br>
friendly?  I'll only have the full day to myself to box on Tuesday <br>
4/3 but w/o a car, the rest will be fit in around family time - in <br>
which case we'd be using a vehicle.<br>
<br>
I'm SOOOOO jealous how many boxes you have in the Portland area...way <br>
more than my time for this trip will allow.  Any input mucho <br>
appreciated - on the list or by email.<br>
<br>
If anyone thinks they might be up for an exchange and coffee that'd <br>
be cool too!<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Rats! I will be gone the entire time you're in town. I would've loved<br>
to have gone hiking with you. I am just glad we got to meet in the<br>
Fall. I think the Musicians Series is a great choice and will probably<br>
fill much of your day. I do hope you will be adding one of your own<br>
crafting while you're at it. It's become quite a gallery of carvers'<br>
work, with fourteen boxes by nine different letterboxers. <br>
<br>
I always think folks should try for the Spirit of Dartmoor letterbox.<br>
It's one of the earliest in the country and is a great piece of our<br>
local history. Der Mad Stamper is first rate when it comes to clues as<br>
well as carving. Then there's his renown as a karaoke singer but<br>
that's another topic. <br>
<br>
Have a ball while you're here and catch me on the next visit. Funhog<br>

Anytime during that long weekend would work for me, doesn't have to <br>
be April 3 (a weekday) - at least I think so, don't know what <br>
birthday stuff they might have planned for me.<br>

<br>
I'm kinda new to this group and about the time I joined I hit midterms<br>
and now finals (I teach at a community college), so I haven't had time<br>
to introduce myself, but I think it would be great to meet some of you<br>
(if you don't mind a newbie sticking her nose in). My family hangs out<br>
at "the Wood" regularly but we might get there closer to 6-6:15 since<br>
my kids (2 & 4) get a bit difficult after 7...At the very least, I'll<br>
get to say hi as I run out the door with screaming kids!!<br>
<br>
I'm thinking Tues. April 3, but I saw another posting about a weekend<br>
day, so when the exact date/time are know, please post it!<br>

Can we (ok I) get a PREcount???? I need to at least do my homework <br>
in the next 48 hours for PTs!<br>
<br>
Soo, I haven't been dropping by this board as much since Maiden went <br>
ahead and gave us a place/time/date.  (Yay Maiden!)<br>
<br>
Confirmed, as far as my trip-planning was concerned, in my mind, at <br>
least.  Didn't catch the subsequent converations re: other <br>
dates/etc.  I assumed (and am still assuming)we have a date!  I <br>
can't really change the above at this point.<br>
<br>
Sorry! if this causes problems for other NW 'boxers, but erm...hey I <br>
kinda started this "Foolishness" , am only in Portland for a limited <br>
time, with most of that time committed to family and, well:<br>
<br>
Ya'll can plan another get-together for exchanges when I'm not <br>
around.  Besides April Fools Day is my birthday (yes REALLY!)<br>
<br>
So just to confirm, before this week gets crazy for me and before I <br>
leave town, and 'cause: I'll barely be online AFTER Wednesday <br>
3/28!!!!<br>
<br>
At least I WILL BE at Laurelwood in the NE/Hollywood section of <br>
Portland at 7 pm on Tuesday, April 3rd!<br>
<br>
I'll be the female blonde in the explorer hat with a beer in my <br>
hand, and probably my brother in tow....his family TBD, and ready <br>
for exchages and 'boxing stories.<br>
<br>
BE THERE OR BE FOOLISH...or BOTH!!<br>
<br>
I'll try REALLY hard to bring the SUN and AWESOME spring weather <br>
from Colorado that we've been having lately.<br>

Laurelwood, 7:00, April 3.<br>
Who's in? <br>
<br>
> Maiden<br>
<br>
Can we (ok I) get a PREcount???? I need to at least do my homework <br>
in the next 48 hours for PTs!<br>
<br>
Soo, I haven't been dropping by this board as much since Maiden went <br>
ahead and gave us a place/time/date. (Yay Maiden!)<br>
<br>
Confirmed, as far as my trip-planning was concerned, in my mind, at <br>
least. Didn't catch the subsequent converations re: other <br>
dates/etc. I assumed (and am still assuming)we have a date! I <br>
can't really change the above at this point.<br>
<br>
Sorry! if this causes problems for other NW 'boxers, but erm...hey I <br>
kinda started this "Foolishness" , am only in Portland for a limited <br>
time, with most of that time committed to family and, well:<br>
<br>
Ya'll can plan another get-together for exchanges when I'm not <br>
around. Besides April Fools Day is my birthday (yes REALLY!)<br>
<br>
So just to confirm, before this week gets crazy for me and before I <br>
leave town, and 'cause: I'll barely be online AFTER Wednesday <br>
3/28!!!!<br>
<br>
At least I WILL BE at Laurelwood in the NE/Hollywood section of <br>
Portland at 7 pm on Tuesday, April 3rd!<br>
<br>
I'll be the female blonde in the explorer hat with a beer in my <br>
hand, and probably my brother in tow....his family TBD, and ready <br>
for exchages and 'boxing stories.<br>
<br>
BE THERE OR BE FOOLISH...or BOTH!!<br>
<br>
I'll try REALLY hard to bring the SUN and AWESOME spring weather <br>
from Colorado that we've been having lately.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

Denver, CO<br>
(working on tan already after a weekend of planting "winter <br>
inventory of boxes"...with a few more still to plant on her Portland <br>
trip...)<br>
