I never heard more from them.  Maybe 2008 will be the year, unless the trail<br>
is STILL closed or destroyed....  I also have a box in Mexico that I planted<br>
in 2005 that I've never gotten any reports on.  This is an easy beach walk,<br>
but not a major tourist area yet.<br>
<br>
On the bright side, I did get a second report last week that someone found<br>
my Gorge Panorama box across the river in Washington.  This box was also<br>
planted in 2005.  I guess it's true that if an area has a lot of boxes, some<br>
boxes tend to languish.<br>
<br>
We also have 6 boxes that were placed in 2007 that we have yet to hear from<br>
anyone about:  VA, WI, MN, and 3 in New Zealand.<br>
