Come on down to Lewisville Park and enjoy this series, pack a picnic, <br>
and swim in the Lewis River for an afternoon of great fun! I will <br>
change this series every couple of years to keep the trail exciting and <br>
the experience at the park enjoyable everytime you come out. Look for <br>
many other boxes placed throughout the park while there. This is a <br>
beautiful park to come back to year after year!<br>
