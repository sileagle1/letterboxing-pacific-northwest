As far as I am aware, everyone is getting the error -- nobody has been individually denied access as the error message might seem to indicate.  I have not been able to contact Choi so there is no estimate as to possible availability time.<br>
<br>
If you were hoping to grab some clues and go letterboxing today, here are a couple of alternate suggestions:<br>
<br>
AtlasQuest - http://www.atlasquest.com - many people list their boxes at both LbNA and AtlasQuest. If the box is listed at AtlasQuest and the clue is stored at AtlasQuest or on the user's personal web site, you will be able to access the clue.  If the box is listed at AtlasQuest, but the clue is stored on the LbNA site, you will receive an error message when trying to access the clue similar to the one received when trying to access the LbNA site.  At this point, you can click on "Cached Clue" at the far right of the header menu to see a cached version of the clue.  Be aware that the cached version is not up-to-date as the clues as cached monthly, but if the clue has not changed recently, this should be fine.  Also note that the cached version will contain only text, not graphics, so if there were pictures as a part of the clue, you are out of luck.<br>
<br>
Old LbNA Site - http://lbna.dyndns.org/index.html - if a box is not listed on AtlasQuest and it is an older letterbox, you may be able to find the clue at the old LbNA web site.  Again, these clues are not up-to-date as changes have not been made since the new site went up 2 years ago, but if you are looking for a specific older box that has not had a change of clue, you might try this.<br>
<br>
Personal Web Sites - Many letterboxers keep their clues on their personal web sites.  There are lists of personal letterboxer web sites in the links directory at the LbNA Yahoo! list, at many of the regional Yahoo! lists and at Silent Doug's web site (http://www.letterboxing.info/links/?id=14).  Perhaps a 'boxer in your area has a personal site with their box clues and you could get them directly from their web site.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for your patience!<br>
