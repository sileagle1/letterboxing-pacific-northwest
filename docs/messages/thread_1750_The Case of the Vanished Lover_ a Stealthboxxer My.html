The Case of the Vanished Lover<br>
a Stealthboxxer Mystery<br>
<br>
Chapter 1<br>
<br>
At first it seemed like just another case.  Just<br>
another dame who had been jilted by some Joe who<br>
didn't have the guts to tell her he was leaving<br>
her and left her broken hearted holding a sappy love<br>
note and memories of a warm spring.  But it<br>
wasn't just another case at all.  This one was<br>
different.<br>
<br>
She showed up at my office on Friday at 5:05 pm.  I<br>
was just about to turn out the lights and lock up when<br>
she pushed the door in and bumped me in the nose.  I<br>
took a step back and took in the sight of a<br>
pathetic, sobbing, lovesick broad wearing an<br>
ancient looking dress and wrapped up with a heavy dark cloak. <br>
I couldn't even make out her eyes beneath the<br>
hood but I could see from the light of the neon sign<br>
thru the window behind me the sparkle of tears<br>
streaming down her cheeks and nose making little pools<br>
on the tops of my shoes like so many dirty raindrops. <br>
<br>
"Mr. Stealthboxxer, I apologize, sir for<br>
arriving after your business hours," she said<br>
between sobs. "Your dear sweet secretary,<br>
Phyllis whom I met on the street front a moment past<br>
informed me that you might still be in office despite<br>
the lateness of my arrival and advised me, although I<br>
fear my request of you will likely be denied, to<br>
inquire of your possible services in locating someone<br>
dear to me.  The man whom I hold dearest of all has<br>
been removed from my bosom and I am here to ask to<br>
employ you in the search for him and your assistance<br>
in his return." <br>
<br>
I knew intantly she was just trying to butter me up.  Phyllis<br>
was about as sweet as a vinegar snow cone and was not<br>
'dear' to anyone and especially some blubbering<br>
handkerchief in a black coat showing up at closing<br>
time. In fact she had just worked me over good and<br>
threatened to quit if I didn't get her the back<br>
pay I owed her from last month by the end of next<br>
week. The messages from the bill collectors she threw<br>
in my face were still scattered all over the floor by<br>
my desk.<br>
<br>
But this was the closest thing I had had to any kind<br>
of case in over a month. And after a little closer<br>
look at her clothes, this broad looked like she might<br>
have some money, old money at that by the look of her<br>
dress.<br>
<br>
"Well, Miss, why don't you come in and we<br>
can talk about it."  I had barely got the words<br>
out before she was crossing the room and examining the<br>
papers on my desk.  I hurried over and closed the<br>
ledger that was open and motioned to the chair beside<br>
the window.  "Wont you have a sit,<br>
ma'am?"<br>
<br>
"Sir, please do not take my actions as any sort<br>
of disrespect, but I must decline your kind invitation<br>
to be seated.  I am a woman in agony and can not be<br>
comforted by the simple things any longer. As I endure<br>
the torment of separation from my precious loved one I<br>
will not allow any rest to my pained body.  I must<br>
continue to stand and ever to walk in endless search<br>
of him.  Only when I am reunited with my dear lover<br>
will I be able to rest."<br>
<br>
What bin did this looney fall out of?  She started<br>
looking around the room and lighted on the framed<br>
Private Detective License on the wall next to the<br>
filing cabinet.  She moved over and peered out of her<br>
hood at the frame and then wiped the dust away with<br>
her black glove.<br>
<br>
"OK, ma'am, then stand if you have to. How<br>
do you think I can help you?"  <br>
<br>
"I have been given your name by one Mr. Dennison<br>
who is the proprietor of the public house on 4th St. of<br>
your lovely town.  He informs me that there is no<br>
agency better at tracing the whereabouts of missing<br>
persons than yours. He said that you would certainly<br>
be able to assist me in my search for a nominal fee,<br>
should you find it in the kindness of your heart to do<br>
so."  <br>
<br>
Jack Dennison was not a proprietor of anything but<br>
just the barkeep of a dirty little whiskey dive owned<br>
by the mob in a very rough part of town near the<br>
wharf.  The only people who went in that joint were<br>
the kind of people you didn't want to meet on<br>
the street unless you had some kind of shady business<br>
to do and you didn't want any<br>
`official' lookers on. I'd had some<br>
dealings with Jack. He was a rough sort but he was a<br>
straight shooter. I had helped to track down a couple<br>
of thugs who robbed his place a couple years back and<br>
with the help of a brute he used as a bouncer once in<br>
a while, we coerced the money back from them before<br>
the brute worked them over and escorted them out of<br>
town.  Whatever Jack Dennison was up to I could trust<br>
that he wasn't going to set me up for trouble.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I know `Mr.' Dennison.  My,<br>
uh, agency has done some, as you said, `missing<br>
person's' work for him before.  But tell<br>
me, why are you here and not at the police station? <br>
Your man in some kind of trouble?"<br>
<br>
"Mr. Stealthboxxer, as much as it pain's<br>
me to say so, the police have not been able to find my<br>
lover since his departure from me well over 2 months<br>
ago.  I have exhausted my welcome with the local<br>
constables in my efforts to encourage their continued<br>
searching and have come to a dead end, as it were and<br>
find myself without any assistance in my dire quest to<br>
find him again.  In effect, they have told me that my<br>
search is futile, that he will never be found.  A<br>
terrible ideal that I just cannot bring myself to<br>
accept lest my own heart fail me.  I am a desperate<br>
person and I will indeed attempt desperate measures to<br>
be reunited with my love.  As for his condition of<br>
being in some kind of trouble, I know not.  I would<br>
assume so due to his absence for such a horrid long<br>
time."  <br>
<br>
"Look, Miss?"<br>
<br>
"My name is of no consequence to anyone. <br>
Indeed, I am no one at all while I am removed from my<br>
dear lover's embrace.  My entire identity is<br>
forever tied to my dear love whom I fear will never be<br>
brought back to me. "<br>
<br>
"All right, I get what you mean.  You<br>
don't need to tell me your name.  I've<br>
dealt in situations like this before: no names, no<br>
reason to give names."<br>
<br>
"It is not like that at all, sir. I am certain<br>
that you cannot possibly comprehend the pain I suffer<br>
now in his absence."<br>
<br>
"Whatever you say, Miss."  This broad was really<br>
something.  Its like she just stepped off a train from<br>
1854.  Her clothes, her words, her manners.  I<br>
haven't seen anything like this before in all of<br>
my `colorful' career.  "Tell me, if<br>
you want me to find your lost love, you have to give<br>
me some information about him and where you think he<br>
might have gone and why.  I'm a pretty good<br>
detective but I'm no Houdini, I can't<br>
make people appear from thin air."<br>
<br>
"Mr. Stealthhboxxer, I have a letter that he<br>
left me before he departed from me.  I hold it as one<br>
of my dearest possessions.  I cannot give the letter<br>
to you as it is the last object that he has touched<br>
that I possess.  However, I have transcribed some of<br>
the words he wrote to me and I will give them to you<br>
now.  I have written the words that I cannot bear to<br>
speak on a paper inside an envelope that I<br>
have sealed here in this pouch.  You will find some<br>
coins inside the purse also that should suffice for<br>
your fee, sir.  I know not how many or what is their<br>
denomination or worth.  I cannot employ myself with<br>
computation or calculation as my heart cannot<br>
comprehend a value that could replace my dear love. <br>
Money is but a trifle to me at this time, something<br>
that is of no value to me but may be useful to others<br>
who may be able to assist me in my search.  The truest<br>
treasure to me is my dear lost love and no riches in<br>
this world can compare to that gem that now lost from<br>
my embrace." <br>
<br>
 At this she began to cry even more and then started<br>
to wail, "Oh, the pain in my heart is almost too<br>
much to bear.  I feel I will indeed pass away should I<br>
not find my lover soon.  Please, Mr. Stealthboxxer,<br>
take my case, though I do fear that it is useless.  I<br>
shall surely never be reunited with him again.  But I<br>
should ever hope, as long as my lungs draw the empty<br>
breath of painful life, I shall continue on.  And if<br>
you are on the case I feel that I can continue in my<br>
endless effort to search for him myself.  Please, sir,<br>
take this purse and perform your services.  I shall<br>
return here in one week hence with another such purse<br>
of coins for your further payment.  Perhaps it will be<br>
a happier time should you find some news of my dear<br>
lover's location and travels.  Please bring him<br>
back to me, sir.  Please."<br>
<br>
She dropped the pouch into my hands and rushed out of<br>
the office.  I could hear her crying all the way down<br>
the stairs and then heard the front door slam behind<br>
her. I just stood there in a stupor for a moment. <br>
Then I moved over and glanced out the side window just<br>
in time to see her slip into the shadows behind the<br>
stationary store across the street and into the night.<br>
  <br>
<br>
What a dame!  What a story!  What do we have here? <br>
This pouch had some heft to it.  I opened it up and<br>
poured it on the desk.  A pile of shiny coins and an<br>
ancient looking envelope fell out onto the blotter. <br>
Wow, this broad was some customer.  I turned on the<br>
desk lamp and looked at the envelope.  It was sealed<br>
with wax and an impression like a signet ring.  I<br>
couldn't make out the insignia of the seal. <br>
However, I could make out the coins.  This blubbering<br>
broad had just left me with forty-five twenty dollar<br>
gold pieces and not one of them was minted any later<br>
than 1849.  Where did this lady come from?<br>
<br>
What did I care? $900 in gold coins was the first bit<br>
of money I had seen come in for 3 weeks.  Maybe I<br>
could pay off Phyllis after all.  I decided to just<br>
leave her 2 coins and a note promising more soon in an<br>
envelope in the top drawer of her desk. It was only<br>
about a quarter of her back pay and didn't even<br>
account for her current pay. I figured she would catch<br>
up with me next week anyway and I could give her<br>
another 40 bucks to keep her interested. I pocketed<br>
the envelope and then I collected my hat and coat and<br>
my old peacemaker and locked up the office.  <br>
<br>
I think I will have to pay old Jack Dennison a little<br>
visit on my way home tonight. I hope he can make<br>
change for a 20.<br>
