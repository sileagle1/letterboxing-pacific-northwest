<br>
We were at the Stamp Camp also.  Someone there mentioned that Columbia Art<br>
has some things.  We went there and was able to buy the carving tips and<br>
handles (similar to what was sold at camp).  You may want to ask about them<br>
their hard to find on your own.  the store info is:<br>
<br>
Columbia Art & Drafting Supply<br>
1515 E. Burnside  (So of Lloyd Ctr... from a Vancouverite's perspective)<br>
Portland, OR<br>
503-232-2216<br>
 <br>
I can't remember the exact price but they seemed reasonable.  My carving<br>
hubby, Wood Splinters, sharpened up the tips.  You may check the tips for<br>
sharpness to decide which ones to buy.  WS does this by lightly running it<br>
across his fingernail to see if it catches.  Typical disclaimers apply here.<br>
:-)  <br>

9,000 miles in 3 months!!! That DOES sound like a lot of letterboxes and a<br>
lot of FUN!<br>
<br>
Cheers all!<br>

<br>
<br>
At STAMP CAMP we were able to purchase a "package deal" that included<br>
a letterbox container, a journal, carving material, baggies AND<br>
Carving Tools!  I understand these to be a reasonable buy but I cannot<br>
find them and need to purchase a "lot" not ALOT! LOL for the Girl<br>
Scout troop.  <br>
<br>
Can anyone from this fine group point me in the right direction?<br>
preferrably without compass clues, trail markers, and vague<br>
descriptions of trees that are hollow......um....yea....okay I digress.<br>
<br>
An ADDRESS....and a store name....yea, that will work!  Oh, and if<br>
possible could this place be in the Portland/Vancouver area?  Hubby<br>
got a bit perturbed with me last night when he told me I put 9,000<br>
miles on my car in 3 months!!!!  Yup, between driving to Gresham five<br>
days a week, driving to church twice a week, driving 1,500 miles to<br>
three different camps and back, and letterboxing.....miles<br>
happen....what can I say?  NOTHING!  Cuz he wasn't happy......oops......<br>
<br>
THANKS IN ADVANCE!<br>
<br>
