                    <div class="plaintext-content">This board seems like a genuine success, and I'd just like to thank <br/>
all of you for making it that way!  =)  When someone on the main <br/>
board said they'd like to see a Pacific Northwest board (I don't even <br/>
remember who that was anymore--sorry!), I figured I'd try creating <br/>
one myself although I had doubts that it would really take off.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the fact that none of the other letterboxing boards really <br/>
took off, I wasn't convinced that enough people from the Pacific <br/>
Northwest were around to reach the critical mass necessary to keep <br/>
thte board going, but you've proved me wrong!  =)<br/>
<br/>
And also, I just love having all your websites so accessible in the <br/>
Links section.  I don't know of anywhere that has a more complete <br/>
listing of websites of Pacific Northwest letterboxers.  Even though I <br/>
know there is still at least one missing (Bill!), I find it a very <br/>
useful resource!  And a couple of you that have websites--I didn't <br/>
even know about them until you asked for me to post the links.  <br/>
Thanks to you all!<br/>
<br/>
Now I've had a few people asking me to set up a Letterboxing <br/>
California board.  *rolling eyes*  My work is never done....  =)  But <br/>
I think that will have to wait until after I return my my epic <br/>
adventure and have more time to dedicate to its creation.<br/>
<br/>
So you see--some of those Californians are having regional <br/>
letterboxing board envy!!!!!  =)<br/>

 Hey Wild Woman, when you were at Tryon Creek, had the landscape at one of the boxes changed?<br/>

Yes!!!  That "leaning" tree in the clues for #3 Red Fox has fallen!  I'd <br/>
learned this from the LbNA archives before we set out (someone had already <br/>
reported it--I'm sorry now that I didn't think to repeat that info in my <br/>
"alive &amp; well" e-mail)--but even knowing that, Heather &amp; I spend a good long <br/>
while in search of that box--the trickiest of the lot in Tryon, I'd say.  <br/>
Have another run at the darned thing--I'm sure it's still there, since we <br/>
found it so recently.  (If you have other boxes yet to find there, you might <br/>
write in their  logbooks that #3's leaning tree has fallen, to help those who <br/>
follow.)<br/>

Actually we did find it just with the directionals!  It took a bit of forensics to decide that the "fall" was recent..... color of roots, growth under the log, etc.  Just enough to lead us to the box.....  We have all the Tryon Creek but the Orphan - and we just haven't had enough daylight in the evenings to get to it.  <br/>
