do some letterboxing and geocaching.  Our destination?  DuPont, WA! <br>
We had a blast, and found 2 of 3 in the Dupont History series, and the<br>
Whales Love Washington box.  We were unsuccessful in the search for<br>
the Davis Place Turtle, and the second box in the history series.  Add<br>
in 2 Geocaches found, and it was a good day.  Great fun, and if anyone<br>
has any info on the boxes we missed, we would appreciate a hint, as<br>
both were found relatively recently.  Ah well. Thanks for reading.<br>
