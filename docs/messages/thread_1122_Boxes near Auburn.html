                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are boxes at Dash Point and at Hylebos SP in Federal Way as <br/>
well as Federation Forest near Greewater.  I am not sure of the snow <br/>
status for the Federation Forest right now.<br/>
<br/>
If you head west on Hwy 18 from downtown Auburn where it passes under <br/>
I-5 it turns into 348th st.  About 1 mile more, on the left  is the <br/>
driveway to Hylebos, look for the log cabin.  This is one of my <br/>
favorite treasure spots.  About 5 miles from downtown Auburn.  Dash <br/>
point is a bit further, right on the county line between Tacoma and <br/>
Federal Way.  Total distance from Hylebos, perhaps 8 miles.  You <br/>
should do a map quest for that venue, as I cannot remember the name <br/>
of the connector road.  Even though I lived there for many years, I  <br/>
just didn't pay attention.  8-o<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link for Trial and Errors boxes at dash point and <br/>
federation forest.<br/>
