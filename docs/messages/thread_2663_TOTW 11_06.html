Okay, I admit it, it was me who raised the t-shirt topic over on<br>
AtlasQuest. Funhog and I have been talking about t-shirt designs and<br>
it's good to hear your opinions. One of the difficulties with the<br>
great slug logo is all the colors, which would be more expensive to<br>
print. What about just a simple mountain or hiking design (like<br>
Calli-K's patch) outlined in black. Or we could go with the LbPNW<br>
letters as suggested.<br>
<br>
I'd really like to have a verse on the back too, if possible. The one<br>
most people liked on AtlasQuest was, "Not all who wander are lost...<br>
some of us are letterboxing".<br>
<br>
What color t-shirts to do you like? We discussed maroon, forest green<br>
or dark purple. I had a crazy idea of ordering them in white and then<br>
tie-dying them myself in a single shade. But I don't know if the print<br>
would show up or if anyone else would like them. <br>
<br>
Glad to hear you're interested.<br>

The easiest most inexpensive way to get a variety of items available <br>
is to go through cafepres.com. One person can up the account, pick <br>
items to have available for personalization and picks the particular <br>
logo they want. <br>
<br>
Customers can then pick what they want whether it be long sleeved or <br>
short sleeved t-shirt, tank top, boxers, thong, sweatshirt, hat, <br>
mousepad, cup or whatever! <br>

            We already have a logo. I think the issue here is to adapt it to the T-shirt design so that it <br>
<br>
has fewer colors. As it is, there are too many to be practical, making it too expensive to <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!<br>
John's feedback and Funhog's question prompt me to explain further.  Then<br>
there's my opinion - for whatever that is worth.  * smile *<br>
<br>
To answer Funhog's questioning why the slug's gender is important.  Well<br>
it's not.  It's just that the overall presentation of the slug is feminine -<br>
it's carrying a purple purse and an orange and red umbrella that comes off<br>
looking like a parasol when you combine it with the flowing train behind.<br>
Of course the purse is supposed to be a Lb pack and the slug has a naturally<br>
build in tail.  It is cute, very cute.  But should we use an image that<br>
possibly alienates half (or whatever percentage) of the letterboxing<br>
population?<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, here's the underlying reason to consider coming up<br>
with something that everyone - men, women, and children - will be<br>
comfortable wearing.  I can't tell you how many times people have said to my<br>
hubby & I how lucky we are that both of us are interested in Lbing.  We hear<br>
it from men and women, but mainly women.  If we present letterboxing as a<br>
women's activity, we loose more men.  Those husbands (or other guys) that<br>
aren't too sure yet if this is for them . . .  but then they see this logo.<br>
If you were in their shoes wouldn't you think, "Oh, it's a girl's thing",<br>
then go away?  Or as one husband said, "it's great for the kids".  At that<br>
point I didn't have the heart to tell him that we don't have kids!  We ARE<br>
the kids!<br>
<br>
It's not one or two persons opinions here that are important - it's the<br>
overall sport that is important. Dogglesnoffer's tree idea sounds good.<br>
Surely there are more people out there with thoughts and ideas, hey?<br>
<br>
Ok, I stuck my monkey fingers out there.  Let's see if I get them bit off!<br>
*laugh *<br>

  We already have a logo. I think the issue here is to adapt it to the<br>
T-shirt design so that it<br>
  has fewer colors. As it is, there are too many to be practical, making it<br>
too expensive to<br>
  print. There are also some folks who would prefer the logo sans slug. If<br>
you haven't seen<br>
  it, look in the files section of this page at the PNW patch. Funhog<br>

I have to say I agree with Jo.  I think the slug design is very cool, <br>
but it is not something that I think most men would pick to have on <br>
their shirts -- well, at least it wouldn't be my first choice.<br>

I'd like to say that I have a sweatshirt from CafePress and also a<br>
sleeveless tank top.  My sweatshirt says "get a clue, go letterboxing"<br>
on the back and has LB circled on the front where the pocket of a<br>
T-shirt would be.  It's a really great hooded sweatshirt with a<br>
pouch-pocket across the belly area.  It's VERY heavy, what I call a<br>
really good quality sweatshirt.  Now the tank top is another story -<br>
not a bad top per se, the quality is fine and I would buy another, but<br>
the words (same as on back of sweatshirt, on front of tank top) are<br>
written in a most unacceptable spot - right across the area directly<br>
under my meager up-top appendages - just an awkward place!  If my<br>
appendages weren't so meager I imagine the words would be sticking out<br>
there all stretched out, if you get the picture.  So I'm just saying<br>
we don't want any slogans on the front of tank tops...  I really only<br>
posted to say that I think CafePress clothing is very nice, and if the<br>
things we get are the same, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase.  I hope<br>
we can make the logo and slogan that are decided upon available in<br>
different kinds of clothing.  I'd love another sweatshirt of a darker<br>
color; mine is light gray and gets dirty almost instantly.  I love the<br>
ideas of brown and forest green that have been tossed out.  I'm<br>
looking forward to another poll like the one that was held a while<br>
back for our PNW logo, hopefully to decide on the slogan and logo for<br>
clothing so we can start ordering!  I would put a few things on my<br>
Christmas list tell ya what.  <br>

I get really dirty at work and sometimes when I letterbox, and I can see myself wearing this shirt in both instances.  I'd hate to pit it out, or even be worried about pitting it out, and thus be hesitant to wear it.  Not sure what we decided on logo color, but navy blue, forest green, and deep red/maroon have always seemed pretty universal.<br>
