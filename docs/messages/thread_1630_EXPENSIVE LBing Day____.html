I do have to say that I've parked there numerous times, <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So sorry to hear about this.  I had something similar happen to me <br>
at Pt Defiance Park in Tacoma in July 2002.  I lost about $1,500 in <br>
the process (damage to the car and things stolen from within--we <br>
carry a high deductible on insurance so we weren't reimbursed at <br>
all).  Not much fun at all!  It also totally changes your view of <br>
the world!<br>
<br>
Amanda had a similar thing happen to her in Olympia not much long <br>
after our break in, as well.  I think it's just the nature of <br>
parking at trailheads.  I've since learned to keep my car as empty <br>
as possible!  Of course, that doesn't work well if you letterbox <br>
while on long road trips.  To this day, it still amazes me that they <br>
stole my diaper bag complete with babywipes but left the digital <br>
camera (that I didn't know was still in the car)!  I only wish I'd <br>
jammed one of those 'nuclear waste' diapers in the bag before we <br>
headed off on the trail that day!  Perhaps that would have made them <br>
think twice about targeting our car!<br>

ANY TRAIL HEAD is a magnet for auto burgs.Do not leave anything in <br>
the passenger section of your car. If something valuable is seen <br>
from the outside of the car the odds are that you will have your <br>
windows broken. It would be best to take your stuff with you, but if <br>
you can't then put it in the trunk.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to make light of your situation or even criticize <br>
your actions or comments, but merely wish to inform those reading <br>
this list. Again, sorry for your loss.<br>

They said that there are a LOT of break-ins at that<br>
parking lot and while I was there there were three<br>
other "parking slots" that had window glass.  So<br>
despite the successful LBing in the area by other<br>
fellow boxers....this is a gentle reminder for<br>
everyone to learn through my experience to leave<br>
NOTHING in your car that would warrant anyone wanting<br>
to break in.<br>
<br>
Stolen from my car was my tape recorder and tape with<br>
my pastor preaching about the Biblical New Year Rosh<br>
Hashana....funny....someone stole the Word of God out<br>
of my car.  I bet they had a shocker coming to them. <br>
Oh, AND they stole the tape cover that was sitting<br>
with it!!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, your advice is helpful.  I left my jacket and my<br>
tape player in sight.  Oh, and my McDonalds drink. <br>
What can I say....bad decision....my point was just to<br>
let folks know that this happens and that no one is<br>
exempt.  In the delight of the hobby and the enjoyment<br>
of hiking, it's important to remember that not<br>
everyone on the trail is there for the same purpose<br>
and it's important to stay safe, bring some sort of<br>
defense with you, and ensure nothing valuable is in<br>
your vehicle when you leave it.  It's a fair warning. <br>
Low priority call or not, I had an entire window in<br>
the seat of my car and the cops and insurance<br>
proceeded to tell me to get the glass out with my<br>
hands.  Luckily two other hikers saw my plight and<br>
were kind enough to allow me to use their hats to<br>
cover my hands so that I could remove the glass enough<br>
to drive home.  <br>
<br>
So on a day where I saw the worst side of a human<br>
being....I saw the BEST side of two human beings and<br>
had an awesome conversation with them.<br>
<br>
It was just a VERY expensive letterboxing day.<br>
Imagine how much Master Carve and PZ cut I could have<br>
bought for the $200 it will cost to get my window<br>
fixed!!!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out to find Panemonium one weekday and parked my old beater <br>
at the trailhead.  Upon return to the parking lot I spotted a little <br>
trail off of the main trail up a small hill.  I decided to do a <br>
little exploring and followed the trail up to a nice little perch of <br>
a log overlooking the parking lot.  It was well adorned with beer <br>
cans and other garbage, apparently a popular picnic area for the <br>
locals.   <br>
<br>
Well, while I was scoping out the facilities a truck pulled into the <br>
parking lot and up beside my vehicle.  The driver peered out his <br>
open window into the front seat of my car on the passenger side.  <br>
Seeing nothing of value and seeing that the doors were purposely <br>
left unlocked he went into reverse and then pulled up alongside <br>
another vehicle in the same lot and did the same scan of that <br>
vehicle.  He must not have found anything of value there either <br>
because he reversed again and high tailed it out of the parking <br>
lot.  I had my digital camera with me but could not get it setup in <br>
time to take a good photo of the vehicle or license plate for the <br>
sheriff.  <br>
<br>
Then to my utter disgust, while I sat there mouth agape, another <br>
vehicle came in and did the same thing. <br>
<br>
That is one spot that should have a big warning sign on it.  I hope <br>
that you two, Amanda and dvn2rckr have put warnings in your clues <br>
about that.  I will never go there with my new truck, thats for sure.<br>

"save" people; but I think a heads up is good - just<br>
like the "wear gloves" tip I got on one my hunts<br>
today; or the "wear long sleeves and pants" we got on<br>
another.  They're just nice tidbits to have to make<br>
the day enjoyable.  But that's my 2<br>
cents....especially after being a victim of it today,<br>
KWIM?<br>

Okay I realize before I say this it may cause some controversy, but hey,<br>
that's what you count on me for right?<br>
<br>
So here's the situation the way I see it.  I really think that if a letter<br>
boxer knew a certain area was prone to break-ins, burglaries, murders,<br>
rapes, and (insert another nasty things that could happen here) - they<br>
probably would not put a letterbox in that given place.  I think it is very<br>
important to remember however that most things vary on time and<br>
circumstance.  It is impossible for the placer to warn you about everything<br>
that you may encounter when searching for a letterbox.  There is no way they<br>
could write a warning that long, that is the basic purpose of the disclaimer<br>
at the bottom of all the clues, because the reality is that it is your<br>
responsibility to take responsibility to make sure that you are acting and<br>
behaving in a manner that is most effectively safe.<br>
<br>
A couple years ago a new letter boxer set off on a letter box that said it<br>
was an easy half mile hike of rock hopping and creek crossing.  That new<br>
letter boxer figured she could walk a mile in an hour so this box would take<br>
all of 30 minutes.  Set out for the box with an hour of daylight left.  She<br>
didn't take that rock hopping and creek crossing warning too seriously, wore<br>
regular shoes instead of ones that might have been safer when wet.  She also<br>
misinterpreted the clues and had trouble finding the box.  - That poor new<br>
letter boxer got stuck on the trail after dark and had to hike out over the<br>
rocks and creek with an ankle that was broken in three places. When she was<br>
done, she went on the list and blamed the placer for not preparing her<br>
better. <br>
<br>
Two years later that same letter boxer is sitting here telling you all that<br>
it was her own lack of responsibility that caused everything that happened<br>
that day to happen.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying that anyone did anything irresponsible here, but I am saying<br>
that asking or expecting the placer to warn you about any problems you might<br>
have in the area is an unreasonable expectation.  Perhaps that box was<br>
planted two years ago and crime in the area has tripled since then.  Perhaps<br>
the crime in the area goes up after 5pm and the box was planted at 7am and<br>
the placer has no idea.  Perhaps you were just unlucky and got caught in<br>
random acts of someone committing crimes that day.  Who knows? But the<br>
placer surly didn't know or the box probably wouldn't be there to begin<br>
with.<br>
<br>
Just something to keep in mind :)<br>

<br>
<br>
Odd as it may seem....this box DID have a date from a<br>
year or two ago and there's no telling how much an<br>
area can change in that time.<br>
<br>
I don't know....I think I am niave and think that all<br>
people are good, so this type of stuff surprises me<br>
but doesn't steal my peace, KWIM?  I also carry a<br>
large hiking stick and a pocket knife when I hike<br>
too....but that did nothing for my car.  <br>
<br>
For me, Pandora and the List....it was just a surreal<br>
thing.  I can't explain it.  I wasn't upset, angry,<br>
crying or anything - just perplexed that someone would<br>
be so desperate to do something like this.  <br>
<br>
I agree, no warning can truly WARN people...I just<br>
would have loved to know that this particular parking<br>
lot is prone to car break-ins.  Specifically glass<br>
breakage according to the cops.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and part of the "shock" was the lack of interest<br>
on the cops behalf.  It shows you what use to be a<br>
crime that people would take notice has now become an<br>
everyday event and warrants nothing on the police's<br>
behalf because between my car vandal and the armed<br>
robbery that took place at the same time....I was<br>
peanuts.....<br>
