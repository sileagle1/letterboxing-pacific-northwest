NOT however, enjoy the fact that while I was LBing<br/>
there my car was broken into and now I have a vehicle<br/>
filled with glass - and my car was ransacked.  After<br/>
45 minutes waiting for 911 to get their head out of<br/>
their backside....I got a hold of the cops who didn't<br/>
feel it necessary to come out and dust for<br/>
fingerprints or anything...why?  IT HAPPENS ALL THE<br/>
TIME THERE!<br/>

Head's up fellow LBers.....if you go to Discovery<br/>

I do have to say that I've parked there numerous times, <br/>

before you. No one else has reported this horrible thing <br/>
happen to them there. Unfortunately, I think break-ins <br/>
happen in all sorts of places, not just this one. I would <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So sorry to hear about this.  I had something similar happen to me <br/>
at Pt Defiance Park in Tacoma in July 2002.  I lost about $1,500 in <br/>
the process (damage to the car and things stolen from within--we <br/>
carry a high deductible on insurance so we weren't reimbursed at <br/>
all).  Not much fun at all!  It also totally changes your view of <br/>
the world!<br/>
<br/>
Amanda had a similar thing happen to her in Olympia not much long <br/>
after our break in, as well.  I think it's just the nature of <br/>
parking at trailheads.  I've since learned to keep my car as empty <br/>
as possible!  Of course, that doesn't work well if you letterbox <br/>
while on long road trips.  To this day, it still amazes me that they <br/>
stole my diaper bag complete with babywipes but left the digital <br/>
camera (that I didn't know was still in the car)!  I only wish I'd <br/>
jammed one of those 'nuclear waste' diapers in the bag before we <br/>
headed off on the trail that day!  Perhaps that would have made them <br/>
think twice about targeting our car!<br/>

They said that there are a LOT of break-ins at that<br/>
parking lot and while I was there there were three<br/>
other "parking slots" that had window glass.  So<br/>
despite the successful LBing in the area by other<br/>
fellow boxers....this is a gentle reminder for<br/>
everyone to learn through my experience to leave<br/>
NOTHING in your car that would warrant anyone wanting<br/>
to break in.<br/>
<br/>
Stolen from my car was my tape recorder and tape with<br/>
my pastor preaching about the Biblical New Year Rosh<br/>
Hashana....funny....someone stole the Word of God out<br/>
of my car.  I bet they had a shocker coming to them. <br/>
Oh, AND they stole the tape cover that was sitting<br/>
with it!!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, your advice is helpful.  I left my jacket and my<br/>
tape player in sight.  Oh, and my McDonalds drink. <br/>
What can I say....bad decision....my point was just to<br/>
let folks know that this happens and that no one is<br/>
exempt.  In the delight of the hobby and the enjoyment<br/>
of hiking, it's important to remember that not<br/>
everyone on the trail is there for the same purpose<br/>
and it's important to stay safe, bring some sort of<br/>
defense with you, and ensure nothing valuable is in<br/>
your vehicle when you leave it.  It's a fair warning. <br/>
Low priority call or not, I had an entire window in<br/>
the seat of my car and the cops and insurance<br/>
proceeded to tell me to get the glass out with my<br/>
hands.  Luckily two other hikers saw my plight and<br/>
were kind enough to allow me to use their hats to<br/>
cover my hands so that I could remove the glass enough<br/>
to drive home.  <br/>
<br/>
So on a day where I saw the worst side of a human<br/>
being....I saw the BEST side of two human beings and<br/>
had an awesome conversation with them.<br/>
<br/>
It was just a VERY expensive letterboxing day.<br/>
Imagine how much Master Carve and PZ cut I could have<br/>
bought for the $200 it will cost to get my window<br/>
fixed!!!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out to find Panemonium one weekday and parked my old beater <br/>
at the trailhead.  Upon return to the parking lot I spotted a little <br/>
trail off of the main trail up a small hill.  I decided to do a <br/>
little exploring and followed the trail up to a nice little perch of <br/>
a log overlooking the parking lot.  It was well adorned with beer <br/>
cans and other garbage, apparently a popular picnic area for the <br/>
locals.   <br/>
<br/>
Well, while I was scoping out the facilities a truck pulled into the <br/>
parking lot and up beside my vehicle.  The driver peered out his <br/>
open window into the front seat of my car on the passenger side.  <br/>
Seeing nothing of value and seeing that the doors were purposely <br/>
left unlocked he went into reverse and then pulled up alongside <br/>
another vehicle in the same lot and did the same scan of that <br/>
vehicle.  He must not have found anything of value there either <br/>
because he reversed again and high tailed it out of the parking <br/>
lot.  I had my digital camera with me but could not get it setup in <br/>
time to take a good photo of the vehicle or license plate for the <br/>
sheriff.  <br/>
<br/>
Then to my utter disgust, while I sat there mouth agape, another <br/>
vehicle came in and did the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
That is one spot that should have a big warning sign on it.  I hope <br/>
that you two, Amanda and dvn2rckr have put warnings in your clues <br/>
about that.  I will never go there with my new truck, thats for sure.<br/>

We all have read the user agreement at the bottom<br/>
understanding that a poisonous snake could be in a<br/>
hole/under a tree, that someone recently let out of<br/>
prison could be lurking, or that thieves could be<br/>
scoping out parked cars.  However, since we do live in<br/>
a world full of "surprises" I think out of respect for<br/>
others and their safety, a additional disclaimer might<br/>
be considered.  No one wants to be ripped off or hurt<br/>
while pursuing their passion or hobby.  And I think<br/>
all of us would be heart sick if something happened to<br/>
someone on a hunt, KWIM?  I know disclaimers don't<br/>
"save" people; but I think a heads up is good - just<br/>
like the "wear gloves" tip I got on one my hunts<br/>
today; or the "wear long sleeves and pants" we got on<br/>
another.  They're just nice tidbits to have to make<br/>
the day enjoyable.  But that's my 2<br/>
cents....especially after being a victim of it today,<br/>
KWIM?<br/>

&gt; I went out to find Panemonium one weekday and parked<br/>
&gt; my old beater <br/>
&gt; at the trailhead.  Upon return to the parking lot I<br/>
&gt; spotted a little <br/>
&gt; trail off of the main trail up a small hill.  I<br/>
&gt; decided to do a <br/>
&gt; little exploring and followed the trail up to a nice<br/>
&gt; little perch of <br/>
&gt; a log overlooking the parking lot.  It was well<br/>
&gt; adorned with beer <br/>
&gt; cans and other garbage, apparently a popular picnic<br/>
&gt; area for the <br/>
&gt; locals.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, while I was scoping out the facilities a truck<br/>
&gt; pulled into the <br/>
&gt; parking lot and up beside my vehicle.  The driver<br/>
&gt; peered out his <br/>
&gt; open window into the front seat of my car on the<br/>
&gt; passenger side.  <br/>
&gt; Seeing nothing of value and seeing that the doors<br/>
&gt; were purposely <br/>
&gt; left unlocked he went into reverse and then pulled<br/>
&gt; up alongside <br/>
&gt; another vehicle in the same lot and did the same<br/>
&gt; scan of that <br/>
&gt; vehicle.  He must not have found anything of value<br/>
&gt; there either <br/>
&gt; because he reversed again and high tailed it out of<br/>
&gt; the parking <br/>
&gt; lot.  I had my digital camera with me but could not<br/>
&gt; get it setup in <br/>
&gt; time to take a good photo of the vehicle or license<br/>
&gt; plate for the <br/>
&gt; sheriff.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then to my utter disgust, while I sat there mouth<br/>
&gt; agape, another <br/>
&gt; vehicle came in and did the same thing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That is one spot that should have a big warning sign<br/>
&gt; on it.  I hope <br/>
&gt; that you two, Amanda and dvn2rckr have put warnings<br/>
&gt; in your clues <br/>
&gt; about that.  I will never go there with my new<br/>

Okay I realize before I say this it may cause some controversy, but hey,<br/>
that's what you count on me for right?<br/>
<br/>
So here's the situation the way I see it.  I really think that if a letter<br/>
boxer knew a certain area was prone to break-ins, burglaries, murders,<br/>
rapes, and (insert another nasty things that could happen here) - they<br/>
probably would not put a letterbox in that given place.  I think it is very<br/>
important to remember however that most things vary on time and<br/>
circumstance.  It is impossible for the placer to warn you about everything<br/>
that you may encounter when searching for a letterbox.  There is no way they<br/>
could write a warning that long, that is the basic purpose of the disclaimer<br/>
at the bottom of all the clues, because the reality is that it is your<br/>
responsibility to take responsibility to make sure that you are acting and<br/>
behaving in a manner that is most effectively safe.<br/>
<br/>
A couple years ago a new letter boxer set off on a letter box that said it<br/>
was an easy half mile hike of rock hopping and creek crossing.  That new<br/>
letter boxer figured she could walk a mile in an hour so this box would take<br/>
all of 30 minutes.  Set out for the box with an hour of daylight left.  She<br/>
didn't take that rock hopping and creek crossing warning too seriously, wore<br/>
regular shoes instead of ones that might have been safer when wet.  She also<br/>
misinterpreted the clues and had trouble finding the box.  - That poor new<br/>
letter boxer got stuck on the trail after dark and had to hike out over the<br/>
rocks and creek with an ankle that was broken in three places. When she was<br/>
done, she went on the list and blamed the placer for not preparing her<br/>
better. <br/>
<br/>
Two years later that same letter boxer is sitting here telling you all that<br/>
it was her own lack of responsibility that caused everything that happened<br/>
that day to happen.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that anyone did anything irresponsible here, but I am saying<br/>
that asking or expecting the placer to warn you about any problems you might<br/>
have in the area is an unreasonable expectation.  Perhaps that box was<br/>
planted two years ago and crime in the area has tripled since then.  Perhaps<br/>
the crime in the area goes up after 5pm and the box was planted at 7am and<br/>
the placer has no idea.  Perhaps you were just unlucky and got caught in<br/>
random acts of someone committing crimes that day.  Who knows? But the<br/>
placer surly didn't know or the box probably wouldn't be there to begin<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
Just something to keep in mind :)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Odd as it may seem....this box DID have a date from a<br/>
year or two ago and there's no telling how much an<br/>
area can change in that time.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know....I think I am niave and think that all<br/>
people are good, so this type of stuff surprises me<br/>
but doesn't steal my peace, KWIM?  I also carry a<br/>
large hiking stick and a pocket knife when I hike<br/>
too....but that did nothing for my car.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, Pandora and the List....it was just a surreal<br/>
thing.  I can't explain it.  I wasn't upset, angry,<br/>
crying or anything - just perplexed that someone would<br/>
be so desperate to do something like this.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree, no warning can truly WARN people...I just<br/>
would have loved to know that this particular parking<br/>
lot is prone to car break-ins.  Specifically glass<br/>
breakage according to the cops.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and part of the "shock" was the lack of interest<br/>
on the cops behalf.  It shows you what use to be a<br/>
crime that people would take notice has now become an<br/>
everyday event and warrants nothing on the police's<br/>
behalf because between my car vandal and the armed<br/>
robbery that took place at the same time....I was<br/>
peanuts.....<br/>

&gt; I forgot to mention what the police told me when I<br/>
&gt; reported my Jul <br/>
&gt; 02 break in (I mention the date because my car was<br/>
&gt; targeted again in <br/>
&gt; the driveway in our 2 police officer town during<br/>
&gt; Spring Breka this <br/>
&gt; past year)...they said it was most likely the<br/>
&gt; Russian mafia and that <br/>
&gt; I'd never see the stuff again.  Who knew?  The truly<br/>
&gt; scary part was <br/>
&gt; they stole the vehicle registration &amp; a key ring I<br/>
&gt; didn't know was <br/>
&gt; in the car (which included a key to our house and<br/>
&gt; mailbox!). <br/>
&gt; Needless to say, we spent a lot of time changing out<br/>
&gt; locks to <br/>
&gt; everything &amp; I've definitely modified what I carry<br/>
&gt; in the car now--<br/>
&gt; as little as possible!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just be careful out there, where ever you are!<br/>
