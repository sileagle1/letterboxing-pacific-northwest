&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Instead of using specific clues to a box they use a GPS to take <br/>
&gt; them to a specific grid coordinate that should lead them to <br/>
&gt; the 'cache'.  Sometimes their instructions for a box will include <br/>
&gt; some more specific info like--once you're in the area, look for a <br/>
&gt; large tree or an intersection of two paths, then SE of it is the <br/>
&gt; cache behind a log or in a stump.  Other times the clue is really <br/>
&gt; just a grid coordinate--depending on the accuracy of their GPS' it's <br/>
&gt; hit or miss finding the cache.  Sometimes if trails aren't well <br/>
&gt; marked in a specific area/park then geocachers may 'bushwhack' their <br/>
&gt; way to a cache instead of following the recommended/established <br/>
&gt; trail in the area.  Once they locate the cache, they usually contain <br/>
&gt; a logbook of some sort and then various prize/trinkets for which <br/>
&gt; they must trade an item of comparable or greater value or intrinsic <br/>
&gt; worth (often the first finder prize is $20 or a new CD or even gear <br/>
&gt; from a GPS company since it's sponsored by those companies).  A neat <br/>
&gt; hobby since it is quite similar to letterboxing, I think it is even <br/>
&gt; an offshoot of letterboxing, although I don't know all the specifics <br/>
&gt; about how it 'spun off'--just the method of locating the cache is <br/>
&gt; sometimes not as direct and may cause more damage to the environment <br/>
&gt; than if they were to use direct clues such as many of the clues to <br/>
&gt; letterboxes since letterboxing clues often incorporate the <br/>
&gt; established trail in the context of the clues leading to a hiding <br/>
&gt; spot that is typically just adjacent to the trail or a few steps <br/>
&gt; away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've come across several geocaches in our letterboxing adventure <br/>
&gt; around the US and often make efforts to stamp in and to ensure it's <br/>
&gt; doing well (the lingering Girl Scout in me) and even eventually <br/>
&gt; contact the placer if I can identify who it is in the log. I even <br/>
&gt; lurk on their message group. However, since my part-time employment <br/>
&gt; often requires the use of technology &amp; GPS's, what attracts me to <br/>
&gt; letterboxing is the clue, escaping from the rigors of daily life <br/>
&gt; (read technology), exploring nature/parks around me and learning <br/>
&gt; about/researching local history.  Personally, I find that more <br/>
&gt; intriguing than looking for soggy Happy Meal toys around the forest <br/>
&gt; (something I can do at any moment within the backseats of my car <br/>
&gt; thanks to my 2 dear not-so-compliant children!).  Regardless, if <br/>
&gt; this hasn't answered your question, you can learn more at:  <br/>
&gt; http://www.geocaching.com/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have a great day and welcome to letterboxing!  Can't wait to get the <br/>
&gt; opportunity to look for letterboxes in your neck of the woods!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; For all of us new comers can you explain what the geocachers do. <br/>
&gt; Do they find stamps like us or <br/>
&gt; &gt; what? It seems as though they are very destructive in their <br/>
&gt; searches. Do they discover a lot of <br/>
&gt; &gt; our letterboxes? It makes me glad that I started letterboxing and <br/>
&gt; didn't get involved with that <br/>
&gt; &gt; scene!<br/>
