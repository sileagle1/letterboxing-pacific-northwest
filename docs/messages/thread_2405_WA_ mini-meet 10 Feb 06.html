By the way, follow Harmons' website for parking directions.  There <br/>
are some options for non-pay parking but you'll have to research it <br/>
before you go.  Otherwise, the best parking is the pay-parking lot <br/>
directly across from Harmons and east of the WA History Museum.  I <br/>
think it's about $4 for the evening or so--but that's if you <br/>
pay 'after' the computer says 6pm otherwise it's more.  We usually <br/>
park way over by Thea Foss Waterway and walk the Bridge of Glass to <br/>
get there--so that's always an option as well.  See you then!<br/>
