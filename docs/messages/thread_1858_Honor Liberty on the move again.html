In a lazy moment, I thought it best to reply on the Hog's previous <br/>
post and add to it.  This wonderful HH (almost a letterboxing in it's <br/>
self) has moved on yet again....  It can now be found resting very <br/>
nearby Funhog's Ridgefield NWR "Carty" box.  Please note there are <br/>
new clues for this wonderful box as the terrain has changed, Funhog <br/>
has updated the clues so if you have an old copy, go reprint it!  <br/>
This is such a wonderful location I am driven to go back as the <br/>
seasons change and enjoy it over and over again.....  Another <br/>
thought, after relocating the HH, I realized I "forgot" to stamp the <br/>
HH into the carty box log book and vice versa.  When you retrive it, <br/>
please do so for me before you move it along to it's next location!   <br/>

&gt; This afternoon Don and Gwen's well traveled Hitch Hiker, Honor <br/>
Liberty found it's <br/>
&gt; latest temporary home in Portland. It is residing quiety in the <br/>
vacant home of Tribute. <br/>
&gt; Although the box by Wingnut appears to be MIA, I could think of no <br/>
more appropriate <br/>
&gt; place to leave this HH. A gentle sweep of loose dirt will reveal <br/>
the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those who are not familiar with Honor Liberty, it is meant to <br/>
be moved as quickly <br/>
&gt; as possible. To facilitate this, Don and Gwen have requested that <br/>
it's hiding places be <br/>
&gt; posted on the chat lists. It is currently beginning it's third year <br/>
of travels. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since Tribute is missing, I was unable to stamp its image into the <br/>
HH logbook. If the <br/>
&gt; person who picks up this hitcher has a copy of the stamp, it would <br/>
be wonderful if <br/>
&gt; they scanned the image and pasted it into the book. If you need a <br/>
copy, I can make a <br/>
&gt; scan at my end and email it to you. Wingnut could probably do the <br/>
same. Pick up this <br/>
&gt; touching stamp! Funhog<br/>

Thanks Wingnut. I just posted a note on NCal list regarding HHers.<br/>
<br/>
 For anyone in the PNW somewhat new to Letterboxing this HH is a <br/>
little different. We wish to have the current location posted so <br/>
that it will be picked up and sent along to it's next stop, and it's <br/>
journey speeded up.With Wingnut's post you will have an opportunity <br/>
for a HH as well as Wingnut's LB and Funhog's LB.<br/>
<br/>
