                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know this is a sensitive subject, but I am starting a  "missing <br/>
boxes" list for my personal use.  I've been using the messages on <br/>
this site to complete it and making notes as to whether the placer <br/>
has said it is missing or if someone just can't find it.  There has <br/>
been a lot of chatter out there lately with people getting out and <br/>
checking boxes.  I was hoping those of you that have placed boxes <br/>
that have gone missing might send me a note off-line and let me know <br/>
which ones are gone for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

established root across the cavity... you had to work to get it out. <br/>
No one is stamping up here in B.C., but they are finding the boxes! <br/>

I'm interested in the hexes and curses. What exactly does that <br/>

I don't know exactly--I wasn't there for it, but midnight, full moon,<br/>
equinoxes, and solstices all sound good to me! =) Maybe someone can<br/>
create instructions for official letterbox curses and hexes. =)<br/>
