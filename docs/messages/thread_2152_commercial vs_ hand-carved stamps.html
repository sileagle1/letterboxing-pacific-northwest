a box with<br>
a commercial stamp in it but virtually all the rest are home<br>

<br>
Funhog and others who are interested:  I just have to say way ahead of<br>
time that I hope you who don't care for the commercial stamps will be<br>
forgiving, I'm sure you will be, when you visit my first box.  When I<br>
first heard of letterboxing way back in April of 2004 I was fascinated<br>
with the idea, found a box in central oregon placed by you as my first<br>
find, actually, the lovely Tetherow House.  There are so many facets<br>
of the sport, it didn't really dawn on me that there would be a<br>
feeling of the hand-carved being better than commercial, just<br>
something I didn't really think about.  We carved some stamps to use<br>
that day and off we went, me, my daughter, son, and DIL.  We used<br>
tempera paints and made a mess of your book I suppose, well not<br>
really, but it was our first try and I'm sure you thought the stamps<br>
were great.  I'm still using that stamp as my own and keep my<br>
daughter's for lending to anyone I can get to come along with me now.<br>
 I has taken over a year to get my first box together, having an extra<br>
special place in mind, and I didn't think twice about spending several<br>
hours searching the web to find "just the right stamp" - actually had<br>
to buy two to get the look I wanted.  It really never occurred to me<br>
to carve one for the box; on the contrary, I thought I was putting a<br>
more professional product in that box by buying them!  Still not<br>
having placed the box because I'm waiting for my grandson to pop out<br>
of his mommy next month and will be doing it when I visit, I now have<br>
much more knowledge about the sport, the things people like and don't<br>
like, etc. etc. etc.  I'm busy carving and getting other boxes ready,<br>
two sitting waiting to be placed when we go camping next weekend and<br>
the one after that, several only on tracing paper so far, some still<br>
in my brain.  It is certainly addicting, I don't have to tell anyone<br>
that.  Being a fairly obsessive person anyway, I probably should just<br>
never touch anything LB again, but I can't stay away.  Funhog, you<br>
BETTER VISIT THAT BOX I'm placing out in Terrebonne - I know you have<br>
a home somewhere over there, and you BETTER LOVE AND CHERISH THOSE<br>
STAMPS now that you know my heart was really in it.  Sorry for the<br>
shouting, I haven't met you in person yet, but that time is coming,<br>
and we can talk more about this - I am fairly sure you will take this<br>
as it's offered, a bit of friendly jabbing.  Some of us just don't get<br>
it right off the bat!<br>

I truly just mean to comment, not start something!  There will be many <br>
opinions on this.  Mine personally.... I LOVE hand carved stamps, even <br>
the worst hand carved stamp, a crumbly cheap eraser with a single line <br>
gouged out of it with a fingernail, would be better to me than a store <br>
bought one... BUT I do give you kudos for thinking your box through, <br>
ordering a stamp with just the right image and feel for your box, it <br>
shows you are working hard on it.  In Dartmoor I believe people <br>
commission their stamps for particular locations, they aren't bought <br>
off of a shelf, but they aren't hand carved either, so there is that <br>
point to look at.  I love that our area is full of wonderful hand done <br>
artwork stamps, from kids to adults, it holds for me the personal touch <br>
of the box.  That someone cared enough to try it and it takes me to a <br>
personal moment or place in their life to share.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I do have a tendency to search for hand carved boxes <br>
over known store boughts, but that doesn't mean I will not go looking <br>
for a box because of it. Often times it is the hike, or the location <br>
that completely wows me even if the box is missing, so I believe there <br>
is something in it for everyone.  Don't get discouraged!  And I hope to <br>
see some handcarved work from you also in the future!?  Wingnut<br>

I hope it doesn't become heated - I hate controversy - didn't intend it, <br>
just was covering my butt for the time when people do visit this <br>
particular box and find my commercial stamp - my intention was to get <br>
forgiveness before anyone even goes so to speak.  As I've told funhog, I <br>
think the location more than makes up for this stamp I bought early on.  <br>
You for sure will see carving from ME - I love it.  As I mentioned, I <br>
have two boxes with carved stamps in them ready to go, one I'm working <br>
on tonight, a couple on tracing paper and one in my brain.  It's just <br>
too fun.  I received nice personal mail from funhog lest anyone think we <br>
are going at it or anything like that.  Ta ta, back to the carving <br>
table...  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of the 200+ letterboxes we've planted, I have two that are store <br>
bought.  These were 'intentional' and a several dozen letterbox <br>
plants into our letterboxing adventure--just so I can say I have <br>
some store bought ones out there.  I, too, prefer handmade over <br>
storebought stamps but usually don't make that the only 'determining <br>
factor' on whether we seek out a particular box.  We usually seek <br>
out a box based on location or historical value to the clues.  In <br>
fact, most of the time I don't even know what type of stamp is in <br>
any letterbox we're seeking.  I also have a handful of planted <br>
letterbox stamps that are school erasers carved with either the fine <br>
point of thread scissors or the empty metal 'base' to a pencil <br>
eraser pinched to create a gouge (used in desperation while planting <br>
a letterbox on a camping trip far away from home back in July <br>
2002).  These stamps are downright HIDEOUS!!! It's up to letterbox <br>
seekers to figure out which letterboxes contain these 'crusty' <br>
examples of my lack of artistic ability.  My hideous stamps just <br>
serve as a great reminder to me that ANYBODY, even folks without an <br>
artistic bone in their body (i.e. ME), can learn how to carve <br>
stamps!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just my two cents worth, so take it with a grain of salt...  If <br>
someone has already planted a box with a store-bought stamp in it, I <br>
would tell them that's better than not planting a box at all.  <br>
However, if they have since learned to carve fairly well, I would <br>
encourage them to replace the stamp next time they visit that box... <br>
or have someone replace it for them.<br>
<br>
As much as I appreciate the effort that goes into carving a stamp by <br>
hand, I have no problem at all with customized factory-commissioned <br>
stamps.  To me, the point is that the only way possible to get a copy <br>
of the stamp image is to visit the letterbox.<br>
<br>
Of course, as you may suspect, I am a fanatical rubber stamp <br>
collector.  Therefore, I have thousands and thousands of rubber <br>
stamps.  So, if you use a stamp that came off of a shelf or from a <br>
catalog, there is a good chance that I already have that very same <br>
stamp sitting at home in my collection. Finding such a box might make <br>
me feel good about the size of my collection, but it bores me to <br>
tears when I stamp it into my letterboxing journal.  I prefer stamps <br>
that are one-of-a-kind.<br>
<br>
Now there are a few people out there who will try to tell you that <br>
some handcarved stamps are not worthy of being in a letterbox. But <br>
not me!  I'm definitely not an artistic snob.  Any old stamp will <br>
do... just so there's not another one like it anywhere in the world. <br>
To be honest, I have found a few that looked like someone ran an <br>
eraser through a tree shredder.  I display them in my logbook with <br>
pride because I know they are completely unique, and they are medals <br>
of honor to commemorate my efforts in finding the boxes they were in.<br>
<br>
But I've been guilty, too.  I have had boxes go missing, and was <br>
short on time, so I replaced a couple of them with store-bought <br>
stamps.  But I ended up feeling like I owed the people who found them <br>
an apology.  In retrospect, I think I would have rather posted a note <br>
in the clues indicating that the box was missing... at least until <br>
such time that I was able to replace it with a hand-carved one. I <br>
have since replaced such stamps with hand-carved ones.<br>
<br>
Please don't ever feel that you need to say you're sorry for placing <br>
a letterbox with a store-bought stamp. But also try to understand <br>
that people are going to great lengths to find your box, and they <br>
deserve something special and UNIQUE as a reward for their efforts.<br>

Now, that John must've eaten something weird for breakfast... this guy makes killer <br>
rubber stamps. In fact, those of you in the Portland area who've found I'm  Late, I'm <br>
Late... keep in mind that this great stamp is one of his stamps that was salvaged <br>
from his discard pile by his vigilant sister. Bless you Carie for saving this one from <br>
oblivion!<br>

I agree and want to mention that one of the favorite stamps in my collection is just <br>
such a stamp, the Chicago Underground by Matt the Rat. The stamps of his that I've <br>
found are made commercially to his design and have a little bitty rat hidden <br>
somewhere in the image. Then there's that very special stamp here in Oregon by <br>
the Green Hornet... <br>

Then you must absolutely adore that stamp of mine that you found at Crooked <br>
River Ranch. The sad part is that I actually had the right tool for the job and still <br>
could only make a stamp like this. Thankfully, my carvings have improved a wee <br>
bit. <br>

Another person whose Cheerios are contaminated! Bethany's stamps are wonderful. <br>
I can, however, testify to the learning curve, having some of those early "classics" in <br>
my logbook. I really enjoy seeing some folks early work compared to stamps <br>
they've made after lots of practice. <br>
<br>
Having just spent the last two mornings teaching 9-12 year olds how to carve <br>
rubber stamps at summer camp, I know beyond a doubt that anybody can learn this <br>
craft. Some of the kids had a natural ability that only took a little direction and <br>
others needed more one on one assistance but every single one of them went home <br>
with a nice stamp! It brought to mind this discussion when one of the campers said <br>
to me, "these are much more fun than ones from the store..."<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">- It's called letterboxing not stamping.<br>
- I don't know what stamp goes with which location without looking in my log<br>
book. This goes for ALL stamps  in my book. Old age? Maybe but read on.<br>
- I recall a few box locations with challenging clues but again no stamps to<br>
go with them.<br>
- Many locations are forever etched in my mind. Rattlesnake Ledge my first<br>
find is a good example, I remember the place as if it was yesterday. As I do<br>
a few others. Too few.<br>
<br>
I could be biased due to my stamps pretty much sucking but I have always<br>
felt it was all location, location, location. It sounds to me that most<br>
anybody can carve a super cool stamp if they practice and put the time in. I<br>
myself would hope you put as much if not more time in your clues and in<br>
finding a location that makes people forget the stamp and remember the trip.<br>
But hey that's just my quirk!<br>
<br>
So if I go on the hunt for a box, what would you people suggest for me in<br>
Western Washington that might etch another place in my mind? Within a easy<br>
daytrip from Tacoma would be best but........?<br>

Sometimes email doesn't convey tone or intent very well.<br>
<br>
I enjoy planting boxes because it not only provides excitement for <br>
others, but also thanks those who have planted before me.  If <br>
someone wants to hide a store-bought, then I remember their intent <br>
and the enjoyment I got from the hike, and appreciate it on those <br>
merits.  But, a unique, hand-made stamp is like icing on the cake.  <br>
The creativity I see in hand-carved stamps never ceases to surprise <br>
me.  <br>
