Brown's Point Lighthouse Mini Meet<br/>
<br/>
Hi--for anybody out there who is interested in joining us, a few <br/>
letterboxers from the region will get together from 2-4 pm (may last <br/>
longer if the kids want to play for a while) on 31 July 04 at <br/>
Brown's Point Park (Lighthouse), WAY-WAY North Tacoma (practically <br/>
Federal Way at this point) to meet with Spacy Holly and her <br/>
letterboxing family from Southern California for exchanges.  <br/>
<br/>
We plan on meeting at the flag pole in front of (West) of the <br/>
lighthouse keepers cottage.  The park offers expansive and <br/>
incredible views of the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound, Vashon &amp; <br/>
Maury Islands, and depending on the tides lots of opportunity for <br/>
beachcombing and boulder scrambling.  There's even <br/>
enough 'greenspace' to throw a football or frisbee.  We plan on <br/>
bringing some picnic items, too.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you plan on joining us then.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we'll see you there?<br/>

I spoke to Iron`Bear this morning and we would be interested in going - we<br/>
would need a lot of advance notice to plan a trip like that and get<br/>
everything we would need prepared, like passports and hotel arrangements<br/>
time off work, ect ect - But we would definitely try to make it if you<br/>
arranged something out that way, we would love to meet you guys and Canada<br/>
Goose - her letterboxes were the first one's we ever went for.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you do try and organize something and that you get a great turn out!<br/>

Best wishes,<br/>

Brown's Point Park<br/>
intersection of Ton A Wan Da NE &amp; Tok A Lou Av NE<br/>
Brown's Point (Tacoma), WA<br/>
Pierce County<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From I-5 North &amp; South: Take I-5 to Tacoma. Turn onto I-705 North, <br/>
then head North on WA 509 North (also named Marine View Dr). Head <br/>
North for several miles as you wind your way around the Port of <br/>
Tacoma. As you approach the residential area of Brown's Point, turn <br/>
Left on Le Lou Wa Place NE. Continue on this road until you see the <br/>
park on your left. Start at the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
There's a shorter way to reach the park from the North (Federal <br/>
Way/Des Moines/Seattle)--I just don't have a map near me at the <br/>
moment.<br/>

You do not have to have a passport if you have your birth <br/>
certificate and a picture ID. This has worked for me the last three <br/>
times we have gone up there and I even called the border last time <br/>
before we left and they said that was all we needed. That was in <br/>
April. Just thought some people would like to know you don't have to <br/>
worry about getting a passport. I hope this gathering will be at a <br/>
time when I can attend.<br/>
