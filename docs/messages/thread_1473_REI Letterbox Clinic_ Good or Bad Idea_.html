This is both good and bad in my opinion. It was an aid to the success of the hobby in <br/>
New England but this state also has a reputation for having many letterboxes hidden <br/>
with store bought stamps and low quality memo pads in them. These are not what I <br/>
want to find when I go boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would prefer that the entire hobby remained an underground pastime. <br/>
However, there has been way too much media attention already for this to be a <br/>
reality. If someone is to teach a clinic, I would hope that it was someone who was <br/>
experienced in the hobby, understood the art and mystery aspects of the craft, was <br/>
an avid hiker and was sensitive to the environment.<br/>
<br/>
For these reasons, I chose to accept a job teaching a letterboxing class for Longview-<br/>
Kelso Parks and Rec this summer. I would've rathered it did not happen at all but <br/>
since they were looking for a teacher and I knew it was going to happen with or <br/>
without my participation, I prefered that it be me rather than someone who didn't <br/>
respect the game as it has developed over the years. <br/>
<br/>
You have some really excellent resources in your area. People who have the skills to <br/>
run a clinic well are right at your doorstep. (What about the First Couple of West Coast <br/>
boxing???) If it has to happen I would hope that folks like this would be the ones in <br/>
this position, not an inexperienced REI employee. Funhog<br/>

<br/>
I think part of that problem is just that 'back in the day', store-<br/>
bought stamps and low-quality memo pads were the norm.  By the time <br/>
it reached up, hand-carved stamps were gaining more acceptance and <br/>
we had some great carvers out here to set an example for us--those <br/>
memo pads were still the most common logbooks found in letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
It's only in the last year or two that home-made logbooks have <br/>
started becoming popular.<br/>
<br/>
The evolution of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, I don't think an REI clinic would cause a rash of <br/>
store-bought stamps and low-quality memo pads.  With such a clinic, <br/>
we can 'indocrinate' them to using hand-carved stamps and high-<br/>
quality memo pads.  (That's a joke--I'm not sure there is such a <br/>
thing as a high-quality memo pad!)  Teach them how to carve.  <br/>
They'll run around a bit finding a few boxes and discover that the <br/>
vast majority of them have hand-carved stamps, and they'll copy <br/>
everyone else's example.<br/>
<br/>
At least in a setting like this, we can set their expectations <br/>
correctly.  If they discover the hobby on their own through a random <br/>
google search or something, who knows what horrible things they <br/>
might think to do.  ;o)<br/>

&gt; bought stamps and low-quality memo pads were the norm.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I've been admonished by Funhog that store-bought stamps and <br/>
low-quality memo pads were not the norm until the unnamed-store <br/>
started getting invovled.<br/>
<br/>
But, I'll still stand by the fact that I think the only reason they <br/>
could create 'the norm' like that was because one hadn't been <br/>
established and entrenched yet.  <br/>
<br/>
With Danny leading the charge, I doubt he'd be encouraging store-<br/>
bought stamps (since, so far as I know, all of his boxes are hand-<br/>
carved).  And second, even if he did, once everyone started going <br/>
out there and finding all our wonderful hand-carved stamps, they'd <br/>
learn pretty quick that Danny left out an important part of the <br/>
story.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Let's face it: Most of us are imitators.  After finding DMS's <br/>
Columbia River Gorge series, I was inspired try to carve as well as <br/>
that.  And when I finally felt I reached that ability, I even <br/>
replaced two of the missing boxes of his!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Amanda says the reason she first carved a lot of negative-stamp <br/>
images (which, let's face it, usually aren't the best looking stamps <br/>
out there) was because for the longest time, that's all she ever <br/>
saw.  It never occurred to her that there was any other way to do it!<br/>
<br/>
So, 'back in the day' before there were standards and conventions, <br/>
it was a lot easier to set a bad example and let it grow.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion, though.  *shrug*  I'm still for the REI clinic, <br/>
though.  =)  I'd rather try to sway them with a qualified person <br/>
explaining the ins and outs of letterboxing than have them discover <br/>
it on their own and figure it out the hard way.  *shrug*<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with Ryan totally.  And while I understand Funhog's concerns, I<br/>
think the issue is really quite different.  REI already holds Geocaching<br/>
clinics - and the truth is whether Danny teaches it or not - at some point<br/>
REI is going to do it.  There was great truth in what Funhog said - there is<br/>
too much media and publicity for this hobby to ever stay the silent mystery<br/>
that some want and wish it would be.  So at this point we have no option but<br/>
to educate the masses in a hope that they will pick up this hobby the way we<br/>
believe it should be played. <br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, after taking Funhog's class last month I personally<br/>
suggested to her that she look into teaching a clinic at REI because I<br/>
thought she good reach a larger group of new boxers in an environment like<br/>
this.  The trouble with that suggestion and Funhog's own suggestion of<br/>
recruiting Ryan or Amanda to teach this clinic is that REI clinics to my<br/>
understanding have to be taught by REI employees. And since Ryan didn't get<br/>
the job at REI he just can't do it ;) (Just giving you a hard time Ryan) <br/>
<br/>
I think the assumption that an REI employee teaching the class would be<br/>
inexperienced is a little presumptuous.  I have dealt with REI several times<br/>
and their employees always seem to have personal knowledge of what they are<br/>
selling and teaching.  I know for example that Kermit, who teaches the<br/>
Geocaching clinic at the Tualatin Store, has been Geocaching for over a year<br/>
or so and has personally re-written the manuals for the most popular GPSs in<br/>
order to teach it with more user friendly and comprehendible material.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally suggest that Danny go ahead and hold the clinic - teach as many<br/>
people as you can the important aspects of this hobby.  I've seen Danny's<br/>
stamps and had the opportunity to meet him personally and I can honestly say<br/>
that I know for a fact he would not tell people that store bought stamps<br/>
were acceptable.  And if he did - just like Ryan said - they are going to<br/>
find out as soon as they hit the trails that we have a bit of higher<br/>
expectations in this area.<br/>
<br/>
My intentions are not to offend anyone here, I am just throwing my opinion<br/>
and my two cents in like everyone else.<br/>

fine job of leading a clinic at REI. His letterboxes have been <br/>
lovely. Great hand carved stamps and those EXPENSIVE Strathmore <br/>
sketch pads for log books :-)<br/>
<br/>
I do think it is important to stress the VARIETY in letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to see more complex clues (and I am a big offender of <br/>
the Go Here, Look There...Find Box school of letterbox clues)<br/>
<br/>
And the synchronization of stamp and clues and place are very <br/>
important to my enjoyment of the hobby. I would like that to be <br/>
stressed. It's not just about the hike or the find, or solving a <br/>
clue, but all three together. <br/>
