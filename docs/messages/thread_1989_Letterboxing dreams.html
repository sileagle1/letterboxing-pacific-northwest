When ever my mind gets on the letterboxing track I tend to dream <br/>
about it too. I looked up a new LB in my area called "Ghost town <br/>
series" read the clues, went to bed, next thing I know I am in the <br/>
setting of some old western ghost town standing on the porch of a <br/>
mercantile. As I stand at the top of the stairs I think to <br/>
myself, "the treasure you seek is where the spiders do crawl" and so <br/>
I reached under the stairs and grabbed the letterbox. Sandi keeps <br/>
telling me to put it back and its not what I think it is (then what <br/>
is it?). *Remember back in science class the glass jars filled with <br/>
formaldahyde and fetuses of different animals?* Well this letterbox <br/>
was a jar also, and floating in the liquid was a living alien fetus <br/>
staring at me. it was the ugliest thing in the world and just looked <br/>
pure evil like it wanted to kill everyone in horrible alien ways, but <br/>
me, being the sappy motherly kind, couldnt just abandon this alien <br/>
fetus even though Sandi was telling me to put it back under the <br/>
stairs. Well we went and found a few more letterboxes and every <br/>
single one of them was lying out in the open on the trail, not hidden <br/>
at all, and it was making me very annoyed because they were my <br/>
letterboxes and i didnt want anyone to steal them or vandalize them. <br/>
Well someone was chasing us down the trail, trying to steal the alien <br/>
fetus from me, and I tripped and fell over a tree root on the trail <br/>
and the jar went flying and broke when it hit the ground and the <br/>
fetus came out of it all grey and looking like an eel, all wrinkly <br/>
and had a huge gash in its head from the fall and it stared at me <br/>
with its big evil eyes, extremely angry at me for dropping it, and <br/>
then it was just about to do something very horrible to me as it was <br/>
slowly unfolding its body from the fetal position and I just got up <br/>
and ran like crazy!!!! Then I was back in the ghost town in a big <br/>
wooden barn and everyone was hunting for easter eggs (havent done <br/>
that since I was a kid... and I never won them or found the prize <br/>
egg) and all the sudden there I was with my (alien-free) basket <br/>
finding all the easter eggs that no one else was finding and then i <br/>
found the prize egg and won the easter hunt (for the first time in my <br/>
life!) Then I went and found more letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Dreams can be so entertaing!<br/>
