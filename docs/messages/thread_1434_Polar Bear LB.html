I know where the Polar Bear's den is. So I'll make a trip either on <br/>
Friday or Saturday morning to see if that darn bear is just <br/>
hibernating or if is truly gone missing. I'll post to the list so <br/>
that everyone knows...and on the clue page also. <br/>
<br/>
My little five year old buddy who stopped by at the Leap Day Event is <br/>
dying for his "Auntie Laura" to take him letterboxing. Hmm...maybe <br/>
him and I'll will work on finding that final stamp from the Sports <br/>
Series too or see if Gwendolyn is ready for me to find her! I also <br/>
still have to hunt down that Narrow's Bridge box of yours too!! <br/>
So..sounds like a perfect plan for letterboxing with my <br/>
little "nephew" and they are fairly easy letterboxes that won't tire <br/>
him out too much. <br/>
