<br/>
Is there anbody in the Tacoma area who would be willing to help set <br/>
up/teach a letterboxing class sometime between June or July this <br/>
summer? If you're interested please let me know and I'll forward you <br/>
the point of contact information from the parks system. Not sure if <br/>
this would be a volunteer thing or something else. Just wondering if <br/>
there's any interest. I'd jump at the chance to do it but unfortunately <br/>
we reside 3,000 miles away these days. :(<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you're interested,<br/>

Aww come on Bethany!! LOL....can't you just pop on over...Think of it <br/>
as a long distance homeschooling field trip! LOL. I think you might <br/>
have a bit o'trouble convincing the military you need a weekly "hop" to <br/>
McChord for you all..but a class at Metro Parks just isn't the same <br/>

Funny...&amp; thanks for the ideas...wasn't even thinking of McChord as a <br/>
possibility (we'd likely end up in Spain or the Azores if we tried to <br/>
go Westbound on a military hop these days--with my luck).  I don't <br/>
think they'll let me fly legally at this stage in my life--just a few <br/>
weeks until #3 comes along.  ;) Otherwise you'd better believe I'd be <br/>
up for a road trip--especially a cross-country one at that (our trip <br/>
out here just barely scratched the surface of my interest--and I've <br/>
driven coast to coast &amp; border to border at least a dozen times both <br/>
directions already)!  AND the trip would be tax deductible so we can <br/>
check on our rental home!!!  Believe me, I'm excited just thinking <br/>
about the possibility of it--I'd drive the 3,000 miles one way just to <br/>
get back to the trees and mountains of the NW!!!  Oh, I think Metro <br/>
Parks is probably pretty happy I'm no longer in the region these days <br/>
because they don't have to keep 'picking up' my litterboxes all over <br/>
the region anymore.  ;)  Hey, only 5 years and 2 months left...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anybody interested in teaching the class?  It might just be a couple <br/>
hour stint on a morning in the summer or they may spread it out to <br/>
three separate days where you focus on one aspect of letterboxing each <br/>
class (carving, logbook making, clue writing/orienteering skills).  <br/>
It's probably totally up to whomever wants to set it up!  Just let me <br/>
know if you're interested and I'll forward you the info about it.<br/>

The Pacific NW would love to see you. Remember the<br/>

here, whatever. Hope you are feeling well. How is<br/>
'everything'?<br/>
Been thinking about you.<br/>
<br/>
Now as to all those othe PNW letterboxers, if you are<br/>
ever thinking of boxing up in BC give us a shout,<br/>
would love to have you here. You can camp out in the<br/>
yard...Team Garlic can be a reference **nodding**<br/>
Or if you just want to attemp our extreme box come by<br/>
for tea/cookies (maybe even fresh crab if it fits and<br/>
they're biting,)and borrow our kayaks. give us a<br/>
shout! There are several letterboxes in the Belcarra<br/>
area<br/>

I had a copy of my birth certificate, and the man who "greeted" us at the border asked our whole van, "Does a copy of a $100 bill work just like a $100 bill?"  I hated most of the people in the class, especially after that better-than-thou incident where they all answered as if I was stupid.  I refrained from saying something to the effect that it certainly would prove that a $100 bill exists, but the actual bill wouldn't be needed unless I was trying to bribe him.  I decided getting the van searched would not go over well with my professor.  As it is, the student driver put it in a ditch up on a mountain, anyway, so they all had something else to worry about.<br/>

  Sorta worried me on getting into Canada anymore...<br/>

<br/>
You could probably google up more info on it  such as whats required for<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
With expired passports we breezed through there without a hitch (last<br/>
summer).  Boy was that a relief!  I had visions of them tearing apart our<br/>
motor home.  It could take  day to look in all the nooks and crannies.  And<br/>
can you imagine explaining why you have a suitcase containing rubber,<br/>
carving tools, plastic containers, fabric, camo duct tape, magnifying<br/>
glasses . . . yes, were upright citizens . . . we just have this hobby . .<br/>

Wood Aug and Kurious Jo can also fill you in on the location, though<br/>
not camping in the back yard, they had their own deluxe accomodations<br/>
in the driveway. Now I can certainly vouch for them in giving carving<br/>
lessons! Wow!<br/>
<br/>
Cliomouse, I don't think passports are a requirement yet, however, I<br/>
think we<br/>
all are at the mercy of whomever 'greets' us at the border.<br/>
We almost didn't make it across with our passports coming into the US,<br/>
the fellow there said I should have the 'long' form birth certificate<br/>
for my daughter and the passport alone wasn't enough. But, he did let<br/>
us, after talking for wuite sometime with him.(and even though she and<br/>
I look so much alike (with almost 40 yrs between), but she is so<br/>
obviously my daughter.<br/>
