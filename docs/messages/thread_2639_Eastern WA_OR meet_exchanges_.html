Howdy!<br>
<br>
I'm a new letterboxer here in Wallowa County and would love to meet<br>
you folks.  I have Fridays off - would you mind a tag along for the day?<br>
<br>
There are a here at the lake I haven't gone after yet and another on<br>
the highway as you come in to Enterprise from Lewiston.  Would be fun<br>
to box with new friends!<br>
