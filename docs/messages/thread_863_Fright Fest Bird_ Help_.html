<br>
As I kicked my feet up and looked through all the wonderful new <br>
stamps in my books last night, I realized there was one little bird <br>
unlabeled in my log book. Easy enough to do, with the stamping frenzy <br>
going on.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping one of you will come to my rescue and give me its proper <br>
name so I may rectify this awkward situation. (As I recall, it was a <br>
hitchhiker in a film canister?)<br>
<br>
Anyone?<br>
