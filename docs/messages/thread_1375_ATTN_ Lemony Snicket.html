road is almost entirely overgrown at this point (at least at the <br/>
start) though we persevered and found it on the third pass. But <br/>
alas, the nefarious Count Olaf has booby trapped the vicinity with <br/>
plenty of stinging nettle. A dreadful feeling came across me as I <br/>
realized I was weaponless and with children in the area of a known <br/>
kidnapper. Instead of risking the chance of two more orphans, with <br/>
haste we made it back to safety though my hands are still stinging <br/>
from the traps. I will try to attempt again without children in tow <br/>
and better equipped for traps.<br/>

afternoon to do our part.  The road was so overgrown--the only reason <br/>

recently.  Little did we know it was you!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Alas, as we hunted for the box, we were attacked by swarms of <br/>
mosquitoes--billions!  I thoughtlessly searched the suspected area <br/>
not paying too much attention to the surrounding vegetation and was <br/>
slain by the evil stinging nettle.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, we did--finally--find that awful box, but alas, our <br/>
efforts were too slow since Count Olaf escaped our clutches.<br/>
<br/>
Nursing our wounds, Amanda and I trudged back to look for a letterbox <br/>
she vaguely remembered being in the area having read a clue for it a <br/>
number of months back.  I rolled my eyes wondering what the chances <br/>
were of finding a second letterbox in the area not really having any <br/>
idea where to look.  Amanda searched half a dozen places and darn nab <br/>
it, she actually found the darned thing.  I thought her efforts were <br/>
folly, but she proved me wrong!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow....  anyone else that wants their chance at catching Count <br/>
Olaf, bring some gloves and mosquito repellent!  *rolling eyes*  <br/>

found the road - leaving a little present near the road we barely <br/>
managed to avoid. But I'm sure we left some additional trace, though <br/>
I think we only trampled weeds. Olaf must have added the mosquitos <br/>
after us getting into the vicinity as an additional precaution as <br/>
none were there when we tried for the box. I wonder what nefarious <br/>
trap will be added for the next unlucky seeker. <br/>
