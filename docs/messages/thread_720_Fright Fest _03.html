Come one, come all!  Team Rayvenhaus is planning the Fright Fest '03 Gathering for Oct 25th, 2003, the Saturday before Halloween, from 10:00am till 2:00 pm (or later, the park doesn't close till 1/2 hour after sunset), at Wapato Park in Tacoma, Wa.  We are carving the Event Stamp, the Monster Mash stamp, which is a rare picture of the Crypt Keeper 5 band of some fame.  We are also setting a series of stamps for the event, and will not be publishing the clues before hand, with a bonus stamp for those that successfully find the others in the series. All of the stamps we are going to carve will be of a frightful nature, and I'm not referring to the carving ability of either of us when I say that.  (Grin)  <br>
<br>
What I would like to also offer is for any one who can not make it to this gathering, to go ahead and carve up a stamp, make a box and ship it to us and we'll plant and maintain it, listing you as the creator of that box.  If you'd like to take us up on this, contact RayvenMom at rayvenmom@myndworx.com and she'll give you the snail mail address to send it to.  We're also planning the premier release of our newest Hitchhiker, the Voyager.<br>
<br>
I invite everyone that can make it to come and join us, meet the people behind the posts. This is a pot luck dinner, bring a covered dish, a salad, something to eat, enough for your group and we'll provide the burgers once again, along with the chips.  Along with the burger fixings. Buns, Mayo, Ketchup and Mustard.  Please give us a simple RSVP to RayvenMom, Myself at rayvenhuas@myndworx.com or here on the mailing list so I know how many burgers I'm gonna burn, I mean cook!<br>
<br>
Bring your own soda's or whatever, (minus alcohol of course, this is a dry park) to drink<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br>

We really don't do the 'Halloween' thing either. We're not going to dress in<br>
costume or anything like that at all.  We're just planning a themed event,<br>
but that's not a requirement to participate at all, I'm just looking for<br>
subject matter to carve......  Wait till you see the Rayvenhaus Star Trek<br>
series of Federation Pins and the Ships.  So, to take a break, we've decided<br>
to carve the Event stamp as a Halloween theme, but aren't sure what the<br>
others will end up like.<br>

If I was able to attend (the middle day of three days of training :-(, poor timing) I would have come in costume.  I would come as a Dreaded Geocacher, the way you could tell would be all the endangered plants stuck to my shoes :-)<br>

We certainly hope that you can squeeze some time to be able to make it, we<br>
missed you stamp at the last event (Grin).  As far as costume, well, I don't<br>
think anyone would even notice as there are 2 geocaches in that area<br>
already, and, speaking of Dreaded Geocachers, let me share this story.  When<br>
we went there yesterday before announcing the gathering, as sot of a recon<br>
of the area, we in fact did stumble across a group of dreaded geocachers in<br>
their natural habitat.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is not a Geocache Bash, this is an observation of what I saw.  Had they<br>
been Letterboxers, I'd still tell the story, good or bad.<br>
<br>
There was a group of 6, a Man, a Woman and three kids of various ages, all<br>
clustered around the bridge at Wapato Lake Park.  They were literally<br>
ripping through the underbrush looking for the cache, tossing the debris<br>
into the lake.  It was almost funny to watch, till one realized the damage<br>
being done.  I sauntered over and proceeded to speak to the man concerning<br>
his children tossing the garbage into the lake, he said that his wife had<br>
lost her contact and they were searching for it.  I returned to where we<br>
were sitting on the bench and watched they thrash around for 10 or so more<br>
minutes when one child screamed I found it and they clustered around a spot<br>
in the underbrush for 5 minutes then climbed back up and proceeded to<br>
depart.  Imagine my surprise when two of the children climbed on their bikes<br>
and headed off in a different direction.  Apparently one is supposed to grab<br>
random strangers to help locate the cache.<br>
<br>
Oh well.<br>

When we found Ecola this summer, it was hidden in the same hole as <br>
the cache! We replanted the LB in the spot that seemed to fit the <br>
clue, and put the cache in its original spot. Don't know how long it <br>
will survive the geocachers.<br>

Just a reminder to let you know that 'The PNWLb Fright Fest '03' is gearing up to be a frightfully awesome event, if I may say so myself!!! <br>
<br>
(We've included the PNWLb in the name as there is another Fright Fest in this area, at Wild Waves and we didn't want to overstep into copyright areas, so, 'The PNWLb Fright Fest '03' was born!)<br>
<br>
We've got more boxes that you can shake a black cat at.  We've received 1 from ScoutDogs and 1 from Chuck Straub, both incredible stamps.  We've got three from Fudrick and we've got 6 of our own.  We've got, of course, the Event Stamp, which I do believe is a fairly good stamp, themed of course. And last, but not least, we have at least one hitchhiker to be released on that day.  You'll witness the inaugural flight of the USS Voyager as she starts off on her maiden voyage.<br>
<br>
There's a rumor that, although the Crypt Kicker 5 has recently had a breakup and is now the Crypt Kicker 5(-2), we could still have a stamp by them to include, though, with the legalities surrounding the rumored breakup, one never knows.<br>
<br>
Rayvenhaus is providing the Burgers and the burger fixings, along with a big bowl of Watergate Salad, provided by RayvenGranny!  Everyone needs to bring a covered dish of some sort and drinks for themselves.<br>
<br>
The park is Kid friendly and there is a play area, so don't worry about that, the RayvenKids will be there playing.<br>
<br>
And let us NOT forget the raffle!  Oh yes, the PNWLb raffle of The Official PNWLb Supplies Box. We've received enough supplies to create 5 boxes with, and we'll be raffling them off to everyone that attends. The contents are as follows:  1 4x6 sheet of 'Pink Stuff', 5 containers, 5 pens, 5 notebooks, 5 Ziploc bags (lg), 5 Ziploc bags (sm), First Finder Award sheets, 'About Letterboxing' sheets, 2 2x3 wooden backs and 3 2x2 wooden backs. All in all, everything needed to create and place 5 Letterboxes! And one lucky attendee will get it all!<br>
<br>
We look forward to seeing everyone there!<br>

I just thought I would drop a little note saying that Team Chaos <br>

We have forwarded a list of the goodies we are bringing out to Team <br>
Rayvenhaus and are sure they will announce what they want too. <br>
<Grins> We are not sure if they are keeping any surprises or not.<br>
<br>
I will also be using my new Signature stamp as of Saturday, so I'm <br>
looking forward to seeing what everyone thinks of it and gathering up <br>
a few exchanges for it. =)<br>

cross-posting something into the mailing list from a website, here's the<br>
latest info on Fright Fest '03:<br>
<br>
PNWLb FRIGHT FEST '03 !!<br>
<br>
Come one, come all to the Pacific NorthWest Letterbox Fright Fest at Wapato<br>
Park in Tacoma, WA! Fun will be had for all, young or old, human or canine!<br>
There will be hamburgers provided! All you have to bring is yourselves and a<br>
dish that will feed those that come with you and your own drinks, and of<br>
course, bring your letterboxing supplies! Plenty of exchanges to be had!<br>
Along with the fun, there will be 10 boxes hidden around the park (which the<br>
clues will be given at the event), many numerous traveller stamps, several<br>
new hitchhikers being released into the wild, exchange stamps with others<br>
and of course, the ability to talk to other letterboxers and share ideas and<br>
stories!<br>
Click here for directions.<br>
We'd love to see you there !!<br>
<br>
The boxes that will be at the event are as follows:<br>
<br>
The Roving Pacific Northwest Travelling Event Stamp (by A. Rose)<br>
The Opraha Travelling Stamp (by Joker's Wyld)<br>
The Wolfman (by Chuck Straub)<br>

many stamps!<br>
<br>
Plus, many have expressed that they will be bringing extra stamps with them.<br>
In fact, Team Chaos has said that they will be bringing "BUNCHES" of stamps!<br>

Notice she said PFX count?  As in any and all letters, symbols and or numbers you may or may not want to count, add, multiply or otherwise keep track of.  So, no. Found in my book only matters for those boxes that are hidden.  As I stated earlier, in the post concerning how Rayvenhaus counts it's numbers, each category is different.<br>
<br>
Sorry if our unclearness in that message confused anyone.  I certainly wouldn't want to dictate to anyone how they should or should not count their PFX numbers.<br>

Fright Fest!  We had such a wonderful group of people and without all <br>
of you showing up, it would not have been anything close to what it <br>
was.  I'll post the particulars later, but again, thank you to each <br>
and every one that came and made it such a fun time for all!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday was a day that shall long live in my memories as a fond time had by myself, RayvenDad, RayvenGranny, RayvenKid #1 and RayvenKid #2... All in all, we had 22 people and their various and sundry offspring show up to make it a total of approximately 30 people at the event (though it's a bit difficult to have counted them as the children never sat still for an instant!)<br>
<br>
I was very pleased to have put the faces with the names of those that I've seen here on the mailing list... And it was equally great to have once again seen those that we met at the Tumwater Event... I honestly feel that I made a few friends for life...  *winks at Willow*... <br>
<br>
I commented to RayvenDad last night on our trip home that we truly do have a wonderful group of people that enjoy this hobby we call letterboxing...  It was a far cry different than the animosity shown at times here on the mailing list... <br>
<br>
As Camp Fire Lady put it, we never know when we are going to find out that we have something more in common than just letterboxing... *smiles at her birthday twin*...  I'm really glad that we were all able to come together in such a large group, that we can sit down and talk like old friends, share ideas and experiences, and just have a grand time...  <br>
<br>
I want to personally thank everyone that came and so enthusiastically joined in the festivities... It is my hope that everyone had a great time and didn't get too frustrated at some of the clues that were given for the planted boxes on site...  Without ya'll, the event would not have been such a resounding success... Even the "masked man"... *smirks*... <br>
<br>
I did perhaps walk a bit too far, and over exerted myself just a bit yesterday, but I'll tell you this...  IT WAS WORTH IT!  I'll be spending the day in bed, recouperating, but I don't regret it one bit... Thank you to those that have inquired about me... RayvenMom bounces back quickly!  I know that if I overextened myself, then I also know Pandora's in a bit of pain... ;-)<br>
<br>
So, again, THANK YOU!!!  I look foward to seeing you all again at the regional event Boxapalooza in April in Battle Grounds, WA!!!!<br>

<br>
I just wanted to write this morning and let you all know how much fun <br>
I had yesterday at Fright Fest.  Team Rayvenhaus put on an excellent <br>
event that left Iron`Bear and I heading home about 5 hours later than <br>
planned. <snickers><br>
<br>
For those of you that have written this morning to see how I am <br>
feeling I thank you so much.  I am doing better although in quite a <br>
bit of pain today.  I think I will be spending today recuperating.  I <br>
definitely was not up to being out on the trails yesterday, but once <br>
you get me going it's hard to get me to stop as Iron`Bear mentioned <br>
last night.  It just felt so good to be out there finding boxes, I <br>
hadn't been out boxing since August and if anything while it was a <br>
little too much on my body, it was awesome for my heart and mind. And <br>
even if Iron`Bear was a bit ticked that I over did it  he was right <br>
there along with me.<br>
<br>
It was delightful to meet some people that I had never met before, <br>
and especially wonderful to get to see some people again.  I don't <br>
mean to toot my own whistle at all, but you all made me feel very <br>
special yesterday.  All the compliments on my carving abilities and <br>
the boxes, and those ladies that too the time to tell me what a cute <br>
and loving couple Iron`Bear and I made, <grins> I felt very <br>
appreciated and very grateful to know that others see that big Bear <br>
just like I do. <br>
<br>
I want to give a special thank you to those that took hitchhikers and <br>
boxes along with them to disperse and cannot wait to see where you <br>
end up putting them.<br>
<br>
On one little troublesome note, I seemed to have lost the <br>
Massachusetts Chickadee at the event.  I was wondering if someone <br>
perhaps picked it up by accident or took it with them to move it <br>
along?  It's a little birdie in an Altoids Tin I would really <br>
appreciate knowing its wear about.<br>
<br>
I haven't even counted the number of stamps I collected yesterday, I <br>
know I will be pasting into my scrapbook for a while today =) But hey <br>
that is a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Thank you again, everyone, and a special thank you to Chuck and <br>
Trish  It was awesome meeting you guys and I really do look forward <br>
to getting together more.  It is nice to have a couple our age that <br>
enjoys letterboxing in the area, I look forward to some great times!<br>
<br>
I bid you all most well,<br>
