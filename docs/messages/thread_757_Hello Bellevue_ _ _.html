For those familiar with a couple Bellevue boxes...<br>
<br>
Mischief/Sunshine/Twilight place the Kelsey Creek Series of 3 boxes.<br>
1. Is great<br>
2. Yep, doing very well - although needs another tablet and I didn't <br>
have one with to add in.<br>
3. Nope. Found where it should have been but did not find the LB. <br>
Unless it is not actually at or around the base of the cedar tree. <br>
There was a lot of company, track teams running so I left without <br>
much searching.<br>
<br>
There is also -Little Happiness.<br>
Heck, I tried about three time to follow the clues and start from <br>
other areas to see if I happen to be on the wrong trail. Needless to <br>
say I never found Little Happiness.  It did put my brain in <br>
overdrive when I found the 'crocodile box' that is mentioned. <br>
However this was quite a few boardwalks beyond the clues.<br>
<br>
Overall it was a great afternoon out, FINALLY.  If anyone has more <br>
info on Mischief's Kelsey Creek #3 or Little Happiness I'd love to <br>
hear about it.<br>

Back in the Spring we found 1 (our first LB!)& 2, but no #3, and <br>
Little Happiness was there. A buddy said that she found #3 and <br>
the "project" box, full of other stamps, but she hadn't found Little <br>
Happiness. She's incommunicado right now, but I'll ask her when she's <br>
back (two weeks).<br>
