                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Girl Scout troop will be Attending the Hands Across the Border event  <br>
at Peace Arch Park (in Blaine, WA) on June 11th. I would LOVE for us to  <br>
find a letter box or even better a series of boxes while we are there  <br>
for the weekend. This weekend will be our Mother/Daughter event. I will  <br>
be introducing them to Letterboxing as we find a couple of So. Hill  <br>
Henderson's boxes that are close by. Then I hope to letterox that  <br>
weekend with them.<br>
<br>
We will be close to Bellingham. I see there are a couple of boxes in  <br>
the area, but they don't sound like they would be easy enough for us to  <br>
get to. What I would like is something that will take us an hour or so  <br>
or longer for a series.<br>
<br>
If anyone has been looking for a place to plant some boxes up north....  <br>
We would love to see more boxes in that area. SWAPPEr and I plan to  <br>
plant our first box AT Peace Arch Park while we are there. to my  <br>
knowledge there are no other boxes in the park at this time.<br>
<br>
Thanks all and have a great day!<br>
