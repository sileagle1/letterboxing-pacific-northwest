                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Girl Scout troop will be Attending the Hands Across the Border event  <br/>
at Peace Arch Park (in Blaine, WA) on June 11th. I would LOVE for us to  <br/>
find a letter box or even better a series of boxes while we are there  <br/>
for the weekend. This weekend will be our Mother/Daughter event. I will  <br/>
be introducing them to Letterboxing as we find a couple of So. Hill  <br/>
Henderson's boxes that are close by. Then I hope to letterox that  <br/>
weekend with them.<br/>
<br/>
We will be close to Bellingham. I see there are a couple of boxes in  <br/>
the area, but they don't sound like they would be easy enough for us to  <br/>
get to. What I would like is something that will take us an hour or so  <br/>
or longer for a series.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has been looking for a place to plant some boxes up north....  <br/>
We would love to see more boxes in that area. SWAPPEr and I plan to  <br/>
plant our first box AT Peace Arch Park while we are there. to my  <br/>
knowledge there are no other boxes in the park at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all and have a great day!<br/>

&gt; Subject: Anyone claim a Depoe Bay Tomahawk?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone contacted me recently through my stamp-carving tutorial site. I<br/>
&gt; don't think the person who wrote the message knows anything about<br/>
&gt; letterboxing. Here is what they wrote:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "hay i was egg hunting at or park in depoe bay oregon and i found a<br/>
&gt; stamp called the tomahawk and its a rubber one just like yours so maybe<br/>
&gt; this is yours get back to me asap plez"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It sounds to me like this person might have stumbled onto a letterbox,<br/>
&gt; but I can't seem to locate a letterbox or hitchhiker on LbNA or AQ that<br/>
&gt; meets this description.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I could determine who this "tomahawk" belongs to, I would like to<br/>
&gt; put them in direct contact with the person who sent the message.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Otherwise, I suppose I will just try to suggest that they put it back<br/>
&gt; where they found it.<br/>
