Hi everyone - my guy & I just moved to downtown Portland a few months <br>
ago (from NJ), and we discovered we no longer needed a car for our <br>
daily living. So, now we use mass transit...the only problem is, we <br>
can't seem to get to letterboxes outside of metro Portland. So we're <br>
looking to meet some new friends who we could ride & letterbox with. If <br>
interested, drop me a note. Thanks!<br>
<br>

Welcome to Portland... I had to laugh when I saw your name. One of the <br>
rangers at one of our local parks districts is named Kyle Spinks! He is <br>
a letterboxing watchdog, checking boxes in his parks for safety and <br>
environmental issues and occassionally posting on this PNW List. We <br>
will all have to be careful not to confuse the two of you! Funhog<br>

When I first saw the message in my inbox waiting for approval I<br>
thought the same thing!  What?  I'd already turned his moderation off!<br>
 Did he quit the group and sign up with another e-mail address or<br>
something?<br>
<br>
Ooohhh, Katy Spinks....   Boy, those names are awfully similar!  I was<br>
half inclined to think it was a practical joke!  =)<br>

Sorry!! I actually have a cousin named Kyle, but he lives in New York <br>
and he's only 12...so no relation. :-)<br>

I am part of the time without a car as well. There are many<br>
letterboxes in the Portland area very acessable by bus though! I know<br>
of someone else in Portland that only travels by bus for letterboxing.<br>
<br>
I would love to meet up sometime and travel by bus to a couple of<br>
letterboxes.<br>
