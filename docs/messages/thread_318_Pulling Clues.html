hundred dollar bill that Mt Tabor was missing when I first looked for<br/>
it. Same with Blue Lake and Multnomah Falls. I know Hidden Dragon has<br/>
stymied many folks. Right now everyone seems to think Beneath the Blue<br/>
#2 is missing but I doubt it. I am one of the people who failed to<br/>
find Cedar Hills Twin #1 ages ago. I couldn't believe it when a recent<br/>
post reported finding it. I went back and there it was, not a single<br/>
entry for 2002! Who knows where that box was all that time??? All<br/>
these clues would have been pulled if searchers' reports were the<br/>
basis for removing clues. <br/>
<br/>
Several of my boxes have been hidden in places that have changed<br/>
dramatically between the time hidden and the time a boxer went to look<br/>
for them. I have experienced several vanishing and appearing benches,<br/>
a grassy trail becoming a wetland, landmarks having been removed, the<br/>
entire tree that was the raison d'etre for a letterbox cut down. In<br/>
every one of these cases, the original clue was totally wrong, people<br/>
failed to find the boxes but the letterbox was still there.<br/>
<br/>
I have the philosophy that any box I hunt may or may not even be<br/>
there. So be it. The only thing that I can imagine being an<br/>
appropriate addition to the clue page would be a warning that the<br/>
placer does not respond to emails regarding their box. Funhoh<br/>

to agree. I didn't realize that Cedar hills #1 had been missing, but <br/>
glad it is still around!!! I searched and searched for cedar hills <br/>
#2 and so did wingnut, only to come up with nothing, then find out <br/>
it has been missing for years!!!  I work right by Mt Tabor and I am <br/>
going on my lunch break tomorrow.  Hope I can find it!!!!!  I have <br/>
heard it is pretty tricky!<br/>
Talk to you soon<br/>
