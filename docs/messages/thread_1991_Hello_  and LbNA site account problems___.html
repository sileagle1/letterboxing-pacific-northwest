Hi!  I thought I'd introduce myself, here, first.  I've been <br/>
letterboxing since last summer, and lurking here for a few weeks.  <br/>
I've converted several family and friends into letterboxers, and am <br/>
having a good time with it, myself.  I'm glad it's turning into <br/>
weather conducive to outdoor activities, finally!<br/>
<br/>
I'm having some troubles with my letterboxing.org "account."  I <br/>
don't recall what happened exactly, as it was months ago, but there <br/>
was some problem with registering with the site.  Now my trademark <br/>
name, ClioMouse, is stuck in limbo.  I can't log in with it, and I <br/>
can't re-make the name until I delete the old one, which I can't do <br/>
until I log in!  I've tried e-mailing the main address on the site a <br/>
couple of times, but got no response.  I then tried e-mailing the <br/>
address listed in the FAQ, and still no response.<br/>
<br/>
I just planted six boxes in the past couple of weeks, and have a <br/>
series I'm working on, but I can't post any of the clues!<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know how I might go about getting someone to fix the <br/>
technical problems with letterboxing.org?  I can't even get a <br/>
response!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

&gt; I had problems earlier this afternoon, and emailed the <br/>
webmasters@letterboxing.  I got a reply email withing a couple <br/>
hours.  They suggested that I put letterboxing.org on my list of <br/>
trusted sites, and/or enable cookies.  I put them on my trusted <br/>
sites and got in, no problem.  (Which doesn't explain, I've logged <br/>
in just fine until today, so I think I agree with you, there are <br/>
occasional technical problems).<br/>

Try changing the password, using the automated system.  I did that <br/>
too.<br/>
