check on my mystery box. I was busy getting my child off to school. <br/>
WooHoo! The kids are back in school! Anyway, I did go out yesterday <br/>
to check a couple of other boxes that were reported missing and found <br/>
that Chelatchie Prairie Railroad is safe and snug in the spot where I <br/>
planted it. Adv2r Skr, I am sorry you missed this box when you were <br/>
here for Stamp Camp but I also feel kind of honored that this box was <br/>
so well hidden that it eluded the infamous Adv2r Skr! Try again. It <br/>
is still there!<br/>
