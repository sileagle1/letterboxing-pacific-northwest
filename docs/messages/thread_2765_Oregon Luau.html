<br>
Anytime you're coming up to Portland, let me know.  If our schedules <br>
coordinate, I would love to go boxing with you.<br>
<br>
My friend in Corvallis, Yiker, & I are trying to plan a trip down to <br>
Eugene to get all those boxes we didn't have time for on Luau day.<br>
<br>
If it happens, I'll try to let you know!  I would love to meet you!<br>
