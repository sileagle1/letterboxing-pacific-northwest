over to Pittock Mansion and got Mark and Beth's Halloween Series.<br>
AWESOME STAMPS and just an excellent fun time letterboxing.  Just my<br>
type of series!  Great clues and great art.  This would definitely be an<br>
excellent series for families with children.<br>
<br>
When we were finished with that, we decided to go find Sleight, which<br>
I've found twice before, but she never had...and she got it!!!  It's<br>
definitely there, folks!  Just where its always been.  That stamp is a<br>
real treasure.<br>
<br>
By the time we were finished it was long past time to meet up with<br>
anyone at the Nature Park and we were hungry so we high-tailed it to<br>
Gresham for conveyor-belt sushi.  <br>
<br>
It was a wonderful fall day for letterboxing.  I hope everyone else who<br>
made it to the various gatherings around the region had a grand time.<br>
We didn't make it to any of those, unfortunately, but we had a grand<br>
time by our own lone selves!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
