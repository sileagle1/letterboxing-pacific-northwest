To whom it may concern:<br/>
Today in the Arboretum near the University of Washington in Seattle, <br/>
Washington, I found a piece of an apparent letterbox and thought <br/>
maybe someone would want to know. <br/>
The letterbox was marked "two trees", and the only thing remaing of <br/>
the box was its lid.<br/>
The lid was next to the trees, on the ground.<br/>
There were teethmarks on the lid, as if an animal had chewed it. <br/>
Visible were the words "two trees letterbox" and your webpage <br/>
address. I put the lid back in between the trees.<br/>
