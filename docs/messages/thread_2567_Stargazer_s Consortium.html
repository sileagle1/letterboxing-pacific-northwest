                    <div class="plaintext-content">This was one FUN event. I love it that Mystery Gatherings have made it<br/>
from the East Coast to our neck of the woods. Kudos to Sam Hill for<br/>
putting this together. I especially liked the way folks who made their<br/>
way there took it upon themselves to hide letterboxes, filling the<br/>
area with goodies to hunt, and covering the table with clues. No one<br/>
was asked to do this. It just happened...That there were visitors from<br/>
as far afield as Texas and Arizona added to the festivities. <br/>
<br/>
I am wondering how many of the boxes that were there are permanent<br/>
placements? I didn't have time to find all of them and have my fingers<br/>
crossed that some will have been left behind. I go that way on one of<br/>
my yearly business trips and would love to stop for a letterboxing<br/>
jaunt. Thanks again, Seior Hill for a good time. Funhog<br/>
