                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well my friends, the stamps are carved, the log book made, the prizes<br>
bought. It's time to gather! Next weekend is the Joker's Wild Letterboxing<br>
Poker Run. As of right now there are about 50 people scheduled to be there. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We will meet at 9:30 in the first large picnic area to the left of the road<br>
as you come in the gate. I'll have the LBNA banner up, so you can look for<br>
it Be sure to wear long pants, Bookworm and I ran into plenty of stinging<br>
nettles as we were planting boxes. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
There will be a total of 87 boxes in the park that day! The 53 for the poker<br>
run will be there for that day only. Check LBNA for the rest :-) There are<br>
several picnic tables, but you may want to bring camp chairs if you have<br>
them. The fun starts at 9:30 with the poker run portion of the day ending at<br>
noon, with potluck lunch to follow. The afternoon will be open for<br>
exchanging, chit chatting, and hunting the rest of the boxes in the park.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
There's still time to RSVP! <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Announcing the first ever <br>
Joker's Wild Letteboxing Poker Run!<br>
<br>
When?<br>
~October 1st, 2005<br>
Register and get your packet from 9:30 to 9:55 AM. The poker run begins at<br>
10:00 exactly. You DON'T want to be late! <br>
<br>
Where?<br>
~Oxbow Regional Park in Gresham, Oregon. Exact location within the park to<br>
follow as the date gets closer. <br>
<br>
What is a Poker Run? <br>
~Definition: A Poker Run is an organized motorcycle event where riders<br>
travel over a prescribed course and at designated stopping points, select a<br>
card. At the end of the run, the person with the best poker hand wins a<br>
prize. But we decided to change it a bit and make it a letterboxing event.<br>
53 cards will be hidden in the park. At 10:00 you will receive clues to the<br>
cards. Without knowing which card is at which location, you have to find 7<br>
cards and make the best hand you can in two hours. <br>
<br>
Are there prizes? <br>
~Of course! <br>
<br>
Is it kid friendly?<br>
~You bet. <br>
<br>
What about lunch? I'm going to be hungry after finding all those boxes!<br>
~We will have a potluck. Bring a main dish or salad to share along with<br>
beverages for your family. We'll provide paper products and dessert!<br>
<br>
Can I stay the night?<br>
~Oxbow's campsites are open year-round and available on a "first-come,<br>
first-served" basis. Maximum occupancy is six people and two cars per site.<br>
Firewood is available for purchase at $4 per bundle. Camping fee is $15 per<br>
night. There is also a $4 per vehicle entrance fee to the park.<br>
<br>
Please RSVP to Maiden at maiden1974@verizon.net or at Atlasquest under<br>
gatherings. We hope to see you there!<br>
<br>
****You do not need a motorcycle to attend this event. All searching will be<br>
done on foot!****<br>
