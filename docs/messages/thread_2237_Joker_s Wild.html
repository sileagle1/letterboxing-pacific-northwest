                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well my friends, the stamps are carved, the log book made, the prizes<br/>
bought. It's time to gather! Next weekend is the Joker's Wild Letterboxing<br/>
Poker Run. As of right now there are about 50 people scheduled to be there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We will meet at 9:30 in the first large picnic area to the left of the road<br/>
as you come in the gate. I'll have the LBNA banner up, so you can look for<br/>
it Be sure to wear long pants, Bookworm and I ran into plenty of stinging<br/>
nettles as we were planting boxes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There will be a total of 87 boxes in the park that day! The 53 for the poker<br/>
run will be there for that day only. Check LBNA for the rest :-) There are<br/>
several picnic tables, but you may want to bring camp chairs if you have<br/>
them. The fun starts at 9:30 with the poker run portion of the day ending at<br/>
noon, with potluck lunch to follow. The afternoon will be open for<br/>
exchanging, chit chatting, and hunting the rest of the boxes in the park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's still time to RSVP! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Announcing the first ever <br/>
Joker's Wild Letteboxing Poker Run!<br/>
<br/>
When?<br/>
~October 1st, 2005<br/>
Register and get your packet from 9:30 to 9:55 AM. The poker run begins at<br/>
10:00 exactly. You DON'T want to be late! <br/>
<br/>
Where?<br/>
~Oxbow Regional Park in Gresham, Oregon. Exact location within the park to<br/>
follow as the date gets closer. <br/>
<br/>
What is a Poker Run? <br/>
~Definition: A Poker Run is an organized motorcycle event where riders<br/>
travel over a prescribed course and at designated stopping points, select a<br/>
card. At the end of the run, the person with the best poker hand wins a<br/>
prize. But we decided to change it a bit and make it a letterboxing event.<br/>
53 cards will be hidden in the park. At 10:00 you will receive clues to the<br/>
cards. Without knowing which card is at which location, you have to find 7<br/>
cards and make the best hand you can in two hours. <br/>
<br/>
Are there prizes? <br/>
~Of course! <br/>
<br/>
Is it kid friendly?<br/>
~You bet. <br/>
<br/>
What about lunch? I'm going to be hungry after finding all those boxes!<br/>
~We will have a potluck. Bring a main dish or salad to share along with<br/>
beverages for your family. We'll provide paper products and dessert!<br/>
<br/>
Can I stay the night?<br/>
~Oxbow's campsites are open year-round and available on a "first-come,<br/>
first-served" basis. Maximum occupancy is six people and two cars per site.<br/>
Firewood is available for purchase at $4 per bundle. Camping fee is $15 per<br/>
night. There is also a $4 per vehicle entrance fee to the park.<br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP to Maiden at maiden1974@verizon.net or at Atlasquest under<br/>
gatherings. We hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
****You do not need a motorcycle to attend this event. All searching will be<br/>
done on foot!****<br/>
