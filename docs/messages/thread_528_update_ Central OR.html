Redmond on Sunday. Even though I left my compass at home and the final<br>
portion of the clue was in headings, the hog prevailed. I had been to<br>
this cool place once before with a group of birders (could one of them<br>
be the new and secretive Birder?) but this clue sent me there from a<br>
different entry point. <br>
<br>
Afterwards, I gave the Dry Canyon South box a second try. Once again,<br>
I failed to find a thing. There is just too much "dead wood" and I<br>
refuse to tear up an area looking for a letterbox. Those poor,<br>
innocent rattlesnakes need their homes too. <br>
<br>
Anyone coming to Central OR in the forseeable future? We need (read:<br>
gimmee) more boxes in that part of the state. Funhog<br>
