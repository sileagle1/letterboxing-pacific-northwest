                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey MiniBullyMom ... how cool that you guys can make it down for some <br/>
boxing with us!!<br/>
<br/>
I checked with Melanie/Maiden re: our plans, as she was going to pick <br/>
me up from my hotel around 10am before we knew you were coming down.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to do some early morning boxing with you guys!!! Not only am <br/>
I a morning person, but I'm one of those pathetic types who are fully <br/>
awake and acting all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  Bindle Bum, not <br/>
being of the same pursuation with regard to mornings, has made a rule <br/>
for me.  No singing, no dancing, and no humming until after he's up <br/>
and consumed at least a full cup of coffee.  LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
I am without transportation, but if you'd be willing to pick me up at <br/>
the Embassy Suites/Airport when you get into town I'll join your AM <br/>
power-boxing trip.  <br/>
<br/>
Breakfast at the IHOP around 9am per Melanie/Maiden who also says we <br/>
can probably get 10 or 12 boxes before breakfast.  Woo-hoo!! <br/>
Letterbox Heaven! That would just about double my "F" number!!<br/>
<br/>
If you're not able to pick me up, not to worry. Melanine will be <br/>
joining Funhog and I at the Laurelwood tonight and we'll let you know <br/>
if there is any difference on the breakfast plans.<br/>
<br/>
Only 90 minutes till I get to tip a pint with Funhog and the rest ... <br/>
see you soon, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; If you're looking for powerboxing before breakfast and then with us <br/>
I would<br/>
&gt; suggest the Gresham area.  We have LOTS of boxes, the Multi Hound <br/>
Canine<br/>
&gt; Collection, Playful Whippet, Circus Memories, Springwater Trail 1 <br/>
and 2, A<br/>
&gt; Rose by any other Name, Swan Lake, and Healthy Living Oregon are <br/>
all within<br/>
&gt; just a few miles.  Oops not to mention You Betcha and What Can I <br/>
Get You.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have discussed either going up the Gorge Saturday morning or into<br/>
&gt; Estacada.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Any suggestions anyone for time or location?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Well...we plan on hitting the road by 5am. Since we are limited <br/>
by a<br/>
&gt;   1pm latest departure time from Portland we figured we'd try to <br/>
get a<br/>
&gt;   morning of letterboxing done down there in LB heaven!  So...we are<br/>
&gt;   open and I'll defer to you the Portland tourguide for guidance. <br/>
Just<br/>
&gt;   give me a time and place and I'll run a "mapquest" search for <br/>
exact<br/>
&gt;   directions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Let me know what boxes you think we should try for Saturday <br/>
morning<br/>
&gt;   and I'll go ahead and run off a set of clues here. We<br/>
&gt;   enjoy "powerboxing" ...aka...the most boxes for our time!! It may <br/>
be<br/>
&gt;   a couple more months before we get down south again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So...breakfast can be where ever jsut let me know what time you <br/>
all<br/>
&gt;   will be ready. I can always fill time by hitting a box or two <br/>
while<br/>
&gt;   we wait. (MomNoTime wants to hit Smith &amp; Bybee and a particular<br/>
&gt;   mystery box.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So..what do you think?<br/>

reading all messages!! LOL!! Okay..I know where the Embassy <br/>
Suites/Airport is...I drove past them twice looking for the stupid <br/>
airport (when I got lost) MLK Weekend. So...we can come straight to <br/>
the hotel to pick you up REAL EARLY!!! Hmm...do they have one of <br/>
those free breakfast buffet that we can grab a bagel or something to <br/>
hold us over til we meet up with everyone else? <br/>
<br/>
I can run off all the clues and would love to get a dozen boxes in a <br/>
couple of hours!! That would also double Christine's (MomNoTime) F <br/>
count and just about double mine too!! <br/>
<br/>
So...I'll patiently wait until Friday evening..I may even call you <br/>
later in the evening to verify everything (free cell time after 9pm)<br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
Til then,<br/>
