                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Nail Family just returned from a week long vacation in the Sun<br/>
River area of Central Oregon. We had the opportunity while there to<br/>
check up on our three boxes that were placed in October of 2002. Two<br/>
of the boxes, the Lava Lands box and the Benham Falls Picnic Area box<br/>
were both intact with log books almost completely full.  We added new<br/>
log books for future finders. (Incidentaly, both of these boxes had<br/>
several log entries from first time boxers. This does not surprise us<br/>
since both boxes are quite easily accessible and close to the highway.<br/>
Also, boxes listed under the Nail Family seem to appear to be rather<br/>
family friendly and often invite new boxers. It makes us feel very<br/>
good to have boxes that give good introductions to the sport and we<br/>
are very glad to have been able to update these boxes on this trip.)<br/>
<br/>
The other box we had placed in the area, the famous Lava River Cave<br/>
Letterbox was sadly missing. The good news is that we have replaced<br/>
the box with a new and different themed stamp and log book back into<br/>
the original location. For all of you who tried to find the original<br/>
and were dissapointed that it was missing, now you have a reason to go<br/>
back. For those few of you who actually found the original box, now<br/>
you have a reason to go back too, a new stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Look for clues to appear soon on the lbna and Atlas Quest sites for<br/>
another letterbox we placed on this trip in the same area as the other<br/>
three.  <br/>
<br/>
Also while we were in the area we visited several boxes at Shevlin<br/>
Park, solved a Paulina Mystery, and made a trip to the Crooked River<br/>
Ranch. Seems there are many more letterboxes in the Central Oregon<br/>
area than when we last visited 3 years ago! Hats off to 4DToes,<br/>
Birder, the Lennens, and Funhog for some very nice boxes. <br/>
Unfortunately, we found it difficult to wrangle the entire Nail Family<br/>
for more than a few boxes per day. In fact, we honestly ran out of<br/>
daylight at Crooked River Ranch and only found one box. Not a good<br/>
thing to be down in a Central Oregon canyon after dark with a bunch of<br/>
rusted Nails (get it, Nails who live in Western Washington) Oh, but<br/>
wait until next time. <br/>
<br/>
Again, all you Central Oregon boxers, watch for the clues to our<br/>
latest box in the Sun River area coming soon to a clue list near you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is very good news indeed! It's a pity that the original logbook<br/>
has gone missing since it had some noteworthy entries in it. This is<br/>
one of my all-time favorite finds. Letterboxing in absolute darkness<br/>
is a special thrill. I do look forward to seeing the latest edition.<br/>
<br/>
I really want to see your latest offerings! The appearance of new<br/>
boxes in this part of the state is always a special treat. I do hope<br/>
you get to return to Crooked River Ranch one day for more of the<br/>
goodies to be found in those spectacular canyons. Granted, my early<br/>
stamps hidden there leave a bit to be desired but the scenery is never<br/>
dull. Plus, now  with Calli-K's excellent letterbox, there is more<br/>
than just my boxes to be found. Funhog<br/>
