yesterday!  We're thinking of heading out that way and trying for a<br>
couple ourselves a little later on.  <br>
<br>
We were out LB'ing, as well, but only to Milo McIver in Estacada to<br>
scope things out and nab the Royal Angler.  <br>
<br>
Glad you are having such a great time letterboxing.  We love it!  It<br>
often takes us on new adventures to new places.<br>
