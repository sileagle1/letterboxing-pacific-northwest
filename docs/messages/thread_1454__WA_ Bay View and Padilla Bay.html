trip to that <br/>
beautiful area. They are both in fine shape and exactly where we<br/>
placed them. Clearly, <br/>
Skagit County attracts a high caliber class of letterboxer. <br/>
<br/>
We removed and gave to our kids plastic trinkets which had been left<br/>
by friendly <br/>
geocachers, who thankfully did NOT take anything in return and had<br/>
signed in politely (a <br/>
high class of geocacher, too). We were pleased to see that our little<br/>
boxes have been <br/>
visited by folks from as far away as Massachusetts and Colorado, as<br/>
well as several locals.<br/>
<br/>
We also set the "Farewell Daylight" hitchhiker on its way somewhere<br/>
in the area.<br/>

Mariette, wishing she could have stayed longer by the bay<br/>
