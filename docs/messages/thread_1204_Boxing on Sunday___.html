<br>
What a wonderful day we had.........we headed up to <br>
BattleGround....as my hubby wanted a "day of Letterboxing"!  We <br>
headed to Lewisville Park, to see how the Happy Postman was!  What a <br>
great series...we had so much fun in the fairy tale world!!  If you <br>
haven't gotten this series yet, go for it, it is fantastic, and <br>
beautiful stamps too!  We also grabbed 3 blind mice, loved it!!!  <br>
After that, we headed down to the river for a picnic. We also <br>
searched for Lewisville Mini Scramble....don't know if we were in <br>
the right spot or not but sure had a feeling we were, but we came up <br>
empty handed with that one, so we got 7 out of 8, always a bummer to <br>
search and not find, but sometimes it happens!!!  After our last <br>
search we headed off to Camas, where I thought we were going to go <br>
nab the Lacamas Creek box, but ended up going to a friends house in <br>
Camas for a Surprise birthday party for Moi!!!!!!  Oh my, that was a <br>
shock!<br>
Too fun...............<br>
<br>
Anyway, we had a great day. So glad the days are so bright lately, <br>
makes good letterboxing fun days!!!<br>
<br>
Talk soon<br>
