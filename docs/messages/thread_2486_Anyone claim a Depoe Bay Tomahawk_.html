                    <div class="plaintext-content">Someone contacted me recently through my stamp-carving tutorial site. I <br>
don't think the person who wrote the message knows anything about <br>
letterboxing. Here is what they wrote:<br>
<br>
"hay i was egg hunting at or park in depoe bay oregon and i found a <br>
stamp called the tomahawk and its a rubber one just like yours so maybe <br>
this is yours get back to me asap plez"<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like this person might have stumbled onto a letterbox, <br>
but I can't seem to locate a letterbox or hitchhiker on LbNA or AQ that <br>
meets this description.<br>
<br>
If I could determine who this "tomahawk" belongs to, I would like to <br>
put them in direct contact with the person who sent the message.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I suppose I will just try to suggest that they put it back <br>
where they found it.<br>
