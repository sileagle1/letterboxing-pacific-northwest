Since I don't want to become a member of this group, I cannot read this <br>
posting. Care to give us the gist of it?<br>

Interesting story and one we can learn from. Many of the letterboxes we find <br>
and all we place are labeled on the outside with the following. "Letterbox. Do <br>
not destroy" and if there's room "www.letterboxing.com". Since the man in <br>
charge of the bomb squad mentioned that if the geocache in question had been <br>
labeled on the outside they wouldn't have wasted time and money on it, I think <br>
everyone might want to pick up the habit if they haven't already. Using boxes <br>
that are partially clear wouldn't hurt either.<br>

Wow, very appropriate, for everyone (not just you PNWers), so I'm copying <br>
the main list, too.<br>
<br>
Two thoughts to take away from this article:<br>
<br>
1. Always label your letterboxes on the outside. A permanent magic marker <br>
would work well enough.<br>
2. Use clear or translucent containers.<br>

Interesting article Bethany, thanks. I enjoyed reading it but I certainly have better things to worry about. When my fellow citizens start being blown to bits by planted bombs I'll worry about it. We aren't even close to that point yet. Spiders, vermin and slithering things scare me much more.<br>
It is too bad to have wasted local police time on such a thing but the GI's over in Yakima had nothing better to do. They are bought and paid for already. Good training for them. (BG)<br>
<br>
I mark mine just so somebody doesn't think it is trash and toss it in the garbage. <br>
