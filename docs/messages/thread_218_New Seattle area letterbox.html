Snoopy was looking for a place that would allow dogs and he found one <br>
such place here in the Seattle area. You just have to go to the Park <br>
that has a trail where you could find Snoopy. Trail maps are <br>
available online. Once on that trail look for the chain link fence. <br>
Could the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm be beyond that fence? Snoopy is <br>
sitting at the base of a 2-in-1 tree waiting for you to find him! <br>
