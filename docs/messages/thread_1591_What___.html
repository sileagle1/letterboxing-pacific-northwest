Subject: Someone should say it :><br>
<br>
........ I just ran into a relatively new boxer who got told he's not<br>
welcome on<br>
a list of what I can only assume are very self important jerks who told<br>
him he's not "serious" enough as his PFX count isn't high enough for the<br>
length of time he's been involved.  Leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.<br>
<br>
I just thought someone ought to tell you (from one who's count is stupid<br>
low for my time in the hobby, but life gets in the way sometimes) that<br>
you're a really great bunch of folks.<br>
<br>
Thanks :><br>
