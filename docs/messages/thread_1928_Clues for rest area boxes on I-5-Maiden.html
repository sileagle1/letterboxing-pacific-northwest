Ok I feel extremely stupid, I thought I was just being helpful and I <br/>
am really sorry for posting to clues. I got several emails requesting <br/>
the clues so I figured there was a lot of interested people so <br/>
instead of flooding my email box I thought it would be easier to post <br/>
them and save people the time of emailing me. I thought i was helping <br/>
out Rambopup since no one else had ever located these LBs and they <br/>
werent listed as mystery boxes. I am very sorry if I offended anyone, <br/>
it certainly wasnt my intention. I guess being helpful isnt always a <br/>
good idea. sorry. I guess sometimes I just forget how secretive <br/>
letterboxing can be. <br/>
