My 2 cents. I think that if you don't hold up the box what difference <br/>
does it make how many sign in??? If you start a box and don't extras <br/>
signing in then state that in the log book or somewhere. <br/>
I think that one of the purposes of the PLB is to be able to see <br/>
other signature stamps from all over. So the more the merrier, as <br/>
long as your are not holding the box for a week so someone can stamp <br/>
in. Purple Iris<br/>
