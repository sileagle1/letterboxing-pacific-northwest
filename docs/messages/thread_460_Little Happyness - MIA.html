&gt; Subject: [LbPNW] WA adoption boxes<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sent e mails to Catbird via her address on her web site but have <br/>
&gt; not yet heard back.  I visited the "Little Happiness" box in <br/>
Kelsey <br/>
&gt; Creek and it is gone.  I recall now that someone here reported it <br/>
&gt; missing but the mystery reptile box is still in place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suspect that Lizard and Catbird pulled the boxes before moving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sent Jay a note saying that I would adopt the lone Bridle Trails <br/>
SP <br/>
&gt; box, thus I have 9 in this park.  The lone BTSP box has been very <br/>
&gt; heavily visited, often by family groups.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tomorrow I will get an early start and do Rattlesnake Ledge to <br/>
both <br/>
&gt; get the box and check on status and see if there is a contact <br/>
address <br/>
&gt; with the box.  If not I will adopt that one as well, perhaps <br/>
placing <br/>
&gt; a second box along the way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After a pause of a few weeks I will be able to check on other <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; in the area.<br/>
