                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well we made it to Anderson Island and now I don't want to leave.  I was so<br>
excited to get out here and I wanted to go to Pike Place Market and Mt.<br>
Rainier, etc. but it's so beautiful on the island that I almost refuse to go<br>
to the mainland.  I've been 3 times since we moved here and it's like<br>
pulling teeth. But..........<br>
<br>
That also means I'm planning a series of Island Letterboxes to make it worth<br>
your while to come over here to the island.  I understand there's a geocache<br>
here but since I can barely work a calculator I won't bother with the GPS<br>
thingy. <grin><br>
<br>
They'll be going out in September and I'll post the clues ASAP.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately it's also becoming the rainy season.  Does anyone have an<br>
opinion on maybe waiting until Spring to plant them or do y'all box<br>
year-round?  In Ohio I didn't box from probably November thru till Spring<br>
because of the cruddy weather but I don't think winter is as harsh here,<br>
just wetter.<br>

We actually go out letterboxing more often in the Fall, Winter & <br>
Spring than during the Summer.  We prefer having the trails to <br>
ourselves--makes being 'discrete' a whole lot easier when <br>
you're 'boxing with 2 young kids.<br>
<br>
As for Anderson Island, we take the ferry occasionally just for <br>
fun!  Cheap excitement for the kids and a whole lot cheaper than <br>
boat insurance, maintenance and payments...  ;)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the Evergray State.  If you plan to box around here better <br>
get a good rain jacket. :)  Actually, we do most of our letterboxing <br>
in the more rain prone months, Sept-May, mostly due to work schedules <br>
but also due to the weather....we actually like the rain and the <br>
cooler temps.  It is surprising just how empty the parks and other <br>
locations can be in the non-summer months.  We like having the peace <br>
and quiet of a park to ourselves.  <br>
<br>
Glad you made it here, looking forward to a venture to Anderson this <br>
fall!<br>

Now the snow and the cold may be another story, but we don't get much of that here. We've had beautiful summers the last few years and pretty mild winters too. I love it. So plant anytime, year round, here!~ <br>
