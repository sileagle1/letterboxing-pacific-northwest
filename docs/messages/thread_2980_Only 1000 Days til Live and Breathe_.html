That's right! Forget about your holiday countdown there are<br>
only 1000 days left until the next "We Live and Breathe<br>
Letterboxing" celebration!<br>
<br>
I realize that's almost three years away, but planning is actually<br>
already underway! Believe me, if the next one is going to even come<br>
close to matching the fun of the first Live and Breathe retreat, then<br>
it's definitely not too early to start getting organized.<br>
<br>
Of course, this time around, we will be celebrating fifteen years of<br>
American letterboxing. Nothing is carved in stone, yet, but the plan is<br>
to have this one on the east coast probably in New England. But we<br>
hope to have plenty of representatives from the Pacific Northwest in<br>
attendance to show them how it's done! :)<br>
<br>
We're currently looking at several residence camps in the<br>
Massachusetts/New Hampshire area, and we've set a tentative event<br>
date for Labor Day weekend, 2013. That would be from Friday, August 30,<br>
through Monday, September 2.<br>
<br>
As our plans become more certain, we will post updates on the official<br>
event website at www.weliveandbreathe.com<br>
<http://www.weliveandbreathe.com>  -- so stay tuned.<br>
