What do you do when someone is willing to take a sig stamp in an exchange from a letterboxer who can not attend an event, but refuses to stamp into that persons log book?<br>
<br>
In other words, if we had a logbook and personal stamp from a friend who could not make it to the event, should someone take their stamp and refuse to stamp the log book?<br>

I realize this is more a moral issue than anything else as there are no rules but the unwritten ones, however, I wanted to know what the consensus of the group is.<br>

strikes me as just that simple -- tho i suspect there will be a VOLLY of answer to this one :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just my opinion,  but personally if I can't make it to the gathering <br>
my log book and sig stamp would not be there either.  I  think <br>
people should only get the stamps if they have made it a priority to <br>
be there in person.  If that's how it works, you could have a ton of <br>
log books and no people there, (just stamp the stamps in my book and <br>
send it back to me!!)  I agree with the no rules thing in LBing, <br>
however, I would not feel right getting stamps for no effort put <br>
forth towards me!!!!  That is like giving another LBer my logbook <br>
while they go out on a LB day and have them get the stamps for me <br>
that they find! No sorry, just doesn't seem right to me, a gathering <br>
is a gathering to meet other Lbers, not just to get the stamps.  You <br>
get the special event stamps and the roving stamps in your book for <br>
being at the gathering, not having your book at the gathering. I <br>
really don't think I would stamp in a log book at the gathering if <br>
the log book not the person was there!   Hope I have explained my <br>
point.  <br>
Just my 2 cents, and I nor my logbook will be able to make it!!!!!<br>

I totally agree.  Unless of course we are talking about Introductions <br>
and such.  I am not sure but I would venture to guess that almost <br>
everyone on this list also belongs the the LBNA site and to my <br>
understanding this list was created for more localized discussion in <br>
the PNW area and if it is something that all letterboxers would be <br>
interested in then it should be on the main board....Is that correct?<br>
