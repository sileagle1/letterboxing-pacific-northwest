&gt; Hey!  There should be 3 coming from our clan, too (1x30something,<br/>
&gt; 1x5yo and 1x22mo)!  Unfortunately, TRKEE will be on sunnier shores<br/>
&gt; at that time.  :(<br/>

That's totally awesome... At this count, we'll provide food (burgers and<br/>
burger condiments) for 18+ people.  Everyone remember to bring a side dish<br/>
item, or chips and the drink of your choice.<br/>
