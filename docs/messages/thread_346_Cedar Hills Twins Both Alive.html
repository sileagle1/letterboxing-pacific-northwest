Box #2 is still there though all the horror stories are true. I <br/>

for children or even the casual letterboxer. It might be best to <br/>
wait for fall to try for it. In any case #2 is extremely unlikely to <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe the placer should rethink it's location, and change the clue so that more will be willing to hunt it.  A difficult hunt is fun, but a painfull one to the boxers and to the landscape is not.  We are learning where to and not to place boxes before we plant any ourselves. <br/>

seek out before I reattempt this one (plus I always have the kids <br/>

so many other great letterboxing adventures awaiting in the region <br/>
to focus on bushwacking through brambles, bushes and trees for a <br/>
mirror image stamp with a simple numeric change to it...  I think <br/>
I'd prefer paying parking fees for a different hunt than appearing <br/>
oddly suspicious in the neighborhood looking for this little twin <br/>
(big statement from me as I loathe parking fees--I've avoided a <br/>
gorgeous neighborhood beach for almost 3 years now because of a $3 <br/>
parking fee).  ;)<br/>
