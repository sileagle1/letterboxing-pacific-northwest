                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got a report that the first box in the B-V network (Buxton <br>
Trestle) was missing. I checked and indeed it was but it is now <br>
replaced. It was interesting to carve an eraser again after such a <br>
long time. I first checked the Tophill box to make sure it was there <br>
in case the nefarious Ranger Rick had pulled all the boxes without <br>
notification. It was there so I assume the Buxton Box went missing <br>
via some other reason.<br>
<br>
I think it was Heather that told me at the gathering that they were <br>
planning to nab these boxes in August. Two are now accounted for <br>
this week as alive, I suspect the rest are also fine.<br>
<br>
Vernonia Lake has gotten a rash of activity lately from some <br>
unfamilar names. I assume the Portland Parent article has something <br>
to do with it. The HH I left there (Ohio Flamingo) was passed up by <br>
one group but taken by the next. Nice to see some letterboxing <br>
activity in the big city of Vernonia. It gives me hope that some <br>
boxes might get planted nearby so we won't have to venture out to <br>
that middle of nowhere Portland place with all the boxes. :)<br>
