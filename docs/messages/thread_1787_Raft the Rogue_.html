from a darling trail angel named Amanda in Seattle!   Though it's<br>
true...she didn't do the hiking for him.<br>
<br>
As for going down the Rogue....hmmmm.  Depending on when it is we might<br>
be interested.  Summer 2005 is already looking awfully full with family<br>
reunion at the end of July, a trip to Arizona and possibly Nebraska<br>
tossed in somewhere in there during summer months.  <br>
<br>
Back to the Rogue.  We've got an Old Town canoe if that would be an<br>
appropriate vessel.  We have kayaks, but NOT inflatables (what inflates<br>
deflates - way too many times and never again.)  Just two long touring<br>
kayaks and one small Mallard.  The sea boats wouldn't be good for white<br>
water.  The Mallard is a single boat, so I'm thinking the canoe would be<br>
the best.   We used the long kayaks on Paddle Oregon a couple years ago,<br>
but the Willamette and the Columbia are different beasts.  <br>
<br>
I can't say for sure never being on it in a boat, but I reckon the Rogue<br>
may be more like the Deschutes or the Clackamas.  Don't know though, so<br>
if someone wants to clue me in I'd be more than glad to know.  We are<br>
avid kayakers/canoers, but we don't do playboats.  Please advise!  Can't<br>
wait to know more.  Thanks so much.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

Flat water canoes would not be good.This section of the Rogue has 1 <br>
class 4 rapid at Blossom Bar,a portage Rainey Falls at and a <br>
multitude of class 3 rapids. There are some rental places around <br>
Grants Pass where self bailing inflatable kayaks can be found along <br>
with PFDs, drybags and other supplies. Before you consider renting <br>
or figuring out what to get down the river in, you should try to <br>
figure out a put on date, and a take out date. Those that are <br>
interested (no more than 10 folks) should apply for a permit. If 10 <br>
folks send in for a permit then you have 10 shots at the lottery <br>
process. Now you have to figure in at least two support boats(gear <br>
boats)and that will take up 4 of the 10 spots. I believe the web <br>
site for the permit processing is www.umpcoos.com/Rogue. The phone <br>
number is either 541 479 3735, or 672 4168.<br>
