My personal favorite was the time I decided to "shortcut" across a<br/>
tidal flat in Olympia to get back to my car. I had a morning flight to<br/>
catch in Seattle for a business trip and decided to go a day early to<br/>
do a little letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
After finding the Lost Loons, it was getting dark and I just knew I<br/>
could get back to my car much faster if I went across what I thought<br/>
was the beach instead of walking the trail back. Well, faster it was<br/>
but tidy is wasn't. The beach consisted of squishy black muck and I<br/>
was soon covered covered up to the middle of my shins. Plus, the aroma<br/>
of the tides was with me. The clothes I was wearing were meant to be<br/>
part of my travel wardrobe. Fat chance! I spent that evening in a<br/>
laundromat, carving a stamp and drying my shoes over and over. I guess<br/>
this just proves that pigs like to wallow in the mire. Funhog<br/>

River Ranch 4 just after it had rained. As we walked, the normally 3-4 inches of Central <br/>
Oregon dust had become a muddy slippery mess and with every step we grew taller. By the <br/>
time we got back to the truck we had several inches of mud stuck to our shoes. We got the <br/>
box and enjoyed the view. Looking forward to some more Crooked River Ranch canyon <br/>
hikes. Hint,hint, Funhog!<br/>

It was dry, dusty, prickly and really hot...middle of Montana at a rest stop <br/>
a few miles from anywhere, signs that say don't leave the trail because of <br/>
rattle snakes, and a letterbox clue that says leave the trail. My daughter <br/>
looked at me like I'm crazy to leave the trail, but we did and found the <br/>
Wind Drinker letterbox. Luckily the rest stop sprinklers came on before we <br/>
left and we got to run through a few times to wash off and cool off before <br/>
we resumed our drive.<br/>
