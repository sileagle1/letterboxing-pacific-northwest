                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got an e-mail today from yet another person that failed to find <br>
this elusive box.  (That now makes three attempted finds that I know <br>
about--all of which have come to failure.)  However, the good news is <br>
that I got some really good information from this person that might <br>
clarify some of the problems people have been having in hunting down <br>
this box.<br>
<br>
First, it seems I got the name of the trail wrong in my clue.  The <br>
box is on North Cape Trail, not the non-existant North Shore Trail.<br>
<br>
In the clue, I also tried to clarify exactly where I started counting <br>
my paces instead of the vague starting point I had before.<br>
<br>
However, the person did say that the side trail my clue says to look <br>
for appears to be overgrown and difficult to find, and the "mounds of <br>
dirt" are no longer there.  Since I'm not in the area and can't <br>
really verify that, who knows?  Maybe with the vague starting point, <br>
she just wasn't looking in the right area for the side trail (it's <br>
not THAT obvious).<br>
<br>
In any case, the letterbox is definitely a lot more challenging than <br>
I planned when I wrote the clue, and I hope some of the changes <br>
help.  So far, I still don't have any reason to believe that the box <br>
is actually missing!<br>

Carpe diem!<br>
