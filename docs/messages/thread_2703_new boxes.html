This next February, I'll have had a box go 2 years without a single <br>
finder AND it's in a major SW US metropolis!  I'm sure there are many <br>
other boxes that have gone longer without a finder, though.  Oh, I've <br>
got almost a dozen boxes in Asia that haven't had finders (or seekers) <br>
yet and most of them have been in place for over 2 years already.<br>

The clues are posted on AQ and LBNA under Hot Treats by The <br>
Weatherlys.  They are in Dupont, WA.  Thanks for asking!<br>

In response to how long have I waited --  To my knowledge, no one <br>
has gotten PCT Olallie to Upper Lake, or Red Lake Trail other than <br>
the first (short hike) box, and I'd almost bet my trekking poles <br>
that no one has gotten Double Peaks.  These were all placed -- <br>
July/Augustish 2005.  Hey, if anyone does go after Double Peaks, <br>
bring a camera.  Great views.<br>

I planted a box April 12 of this year.  It is on a paved walking trail, <br>
requiring a half mile walk over flat ground.  More than a million <br>
people live within a 20 minute drive of the box.  The clues are not <br>
totally easy, but they are not that hard.  I got my first finder last <br>
week.  Sometimes the first visitors come quickly, sometimes patience is <br>
the order of the day!<br>

Speak for yourself ;) <br>
<br>
We plan to take a second try at both of yours in that area sometime,<br>
but it will probably be next summer before we have time to get out<br>
there again.<br>
<br>
Not found doesn't necessarily mean not attempted.<br>
<br>
And after all, the feeling of accomplishment when we finally find the<br>
more difficult boxes makes up for the difficulty.<br>
<br>
Mariette - was trying to be first finder on the box in question, since<br>
it's partly named after me ;)<br>

Ok, so maybe they're kinda tough!  Sorry, no offense.  =)<br>
<br>
I know there have been several searchers for this "series."  <br>
<br>
I have to agree with you, though, that challenging boxes are quite <br>
satisfying once you actually find them....<br>

Bummer!  We got oh so close to this one (20 miles?) but ran out of <br>
daylight to snag it last summer.<br>

Found this one, too--navigated massive snowdrifts in mid-July to find <br>
it.  I presume that's always an issue 'round those parts.<br>

Yep, I think you were the third finder in three+ years to figure out <br>

near Heppner, Oregon which is a fairly remote area.  I've got two<br>

our Emmett's Gems Letterbox in Emmett, Idaho--in 2 weeks it will have <br>

So, yes, patience when planting new letterboxes is a good thing to <br>
have.  ;)<br>
