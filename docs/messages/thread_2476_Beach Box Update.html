looking for this weekend.<br>
<br>
Ona At Beaver Creek  did not find<br>
<br>
Tank's First Camp Out  did not find, pretty sure it's missing<br>
<br>
Jett's Victory Tour  did not find, pretty sure it's missing<br>
<br>
Viking Victories  found (box was destroyed, though.  I contacted <br>
the placer and, on her request, removed the box for maintenance)<br>
<br>
Chicken of the Sea  did not find, pretty sure it's missing<br>
<br>
Yahoo Kernville!  alive and well (clever hiding spot, too)<br>
<br>
Chris the Crab at Cape Foulweather  alive and well (I renamed this <br>
one Kris the Krab at Kape Foulweather because I twisted my knee here <br>
and was most grouchy.  Great stamp though, and such a beautiful <br>
spot.  Also, if any of you collect smashed pennies, there is a <br>
machine here)<br>
<br>
Beverly Beach Duo  the river/creek was too high to cross, so I <br>
couldn't look for box #1, and did not look for #2 (see Kris the Krab <br>
note)<br>
<br>
Canteen  did not find, pretty sure it's missing<br>
<br>
Bookworm Box  alive and well.  AWESOME box.  Thank you for planting <br>
this box just for me :-)<br>
<br>
Howard Street Charter School  Alive and well.  Bring nuts for the <br>
squirrels!<br>
<br>
MITCH Charter School  alive and well.<br>
<br>
Bush's Pasture Park  alive and well.<br>
<br>
Road Trip Series  Salem to the Coast  Did this one backwards.<br>
	#7  alive and well<br>
	#6  alive and well<br>
	#5  did not find, pretty sure it's missing<br>
	#4  wasn't paying attention and passed the place. Dang it!!!<br>
	#3  alive and well<br>
	#2  did not find, pretty sure it's missing<br>
	#1  alive and well<br>
<br>
I guess I got more letterboxes than I did scrapbooking pages <br>
completed, but it was fun.  I noted the ones that I found the spot <br>
that seemed to be the right place but did not find the box.  Please <br>
remember that no box is truly considered missing until the placer <br>
says it is.  I have been known to miss a box that is right under my <br>
nose!<br>

I'm sad Ona's missing.  That was a good one.  Neat park, though.  Can't wait <br>
to look for some of the many I didn't have time for last time I was there.<br>
