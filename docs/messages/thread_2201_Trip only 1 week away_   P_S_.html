the PDX area last year, I thought I had died and gone to letterbox heaven.<br/>

See if Fun Hog or Maiden are around. One of them should be able to<br/>
tell you the name of the Brew Pub a group of local boxers meet up with<br/>
me at while I was out there. I had my first ever Organic Beer at this<br/>
Pub and fell in love with Garlic Fries ... which I still have cravings<br/>
for and haven't yet forgiven them for introducing me to. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

who just happened back to this board today, for the first time in a<br/>
while, because I just posted about my Sept trip to the Mid-Atlantic<br/>
area on their local board. How cool is that? You post on the PNW board<br/>
and get someone from your own local board giving a reply<br/>

were there in May and had a blast.  Hiked w/LightinBug and 3 others; <br/>
also met Irene of Hikers&amp;Hounds and 3 others for a great dinner one <br/>
night.  (We were in Eastern Pennsylvania).<br/>
<br/>
We're hoping to meet up w/Funhog while we're in PDX to do some hiking.  <br/>
A few others have expressed some interest in boxing w/us while we're <br/>
there.  There has also been some talk about a pizza dinner w/others, so <br/>
we'll see what develops...<br/>

WHAT we're talking about, Bindle Babe recently posted a clue that "requires<br/>
diving equipment to obtain."  Clues include these lines:  "Lake - Michigan<br/>
Depth - 48 to 90 feet"  and "The letterbox rests inside of a blue dry-box,<br/>
weighted with a mushroom anchor, about 15 feet aft of the stern of the<br/>
wreck." )<br/>
