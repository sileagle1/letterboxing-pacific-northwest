That sounds like a GREAT day for you.  <br>
Did the UK letterboxer leave any sort of notation with<br>
their stamp?<br>
I hear that the UK boxers often used purchased stamps<br>
for their signature - read that in one of two books<br>
I've purchased on this hobby.  I know you don't want<br>
to reveal the stamp itself because that's a prize! but<br>
would you be willing to share what the boxer said, if<br>
anything?  <br>
I'm thrilled for you!!!  What a treat!<br>

He did. The sad thing is that he forgot to pack his danged stamp! He had just <br>
stopped at the Yakima Visitor Center, where they, kindly enough, offer free internet <br>
access. He had just found out about my boxes there and scurried out to find them. He <br>
did note that he had just created a nine box "walk" (what they call a series over there) <br>
in his hometown of Sussex. I'll just have to get myself over there to have a look one <br>
of these days. <br>

My understanding is that they design their own stamps but have them commercially <br>
carved. This is true of many of the stamps hidden in boxes there as well. I can only <br>
think of three letterboxes done like this in the PNW. Funhog<br>
