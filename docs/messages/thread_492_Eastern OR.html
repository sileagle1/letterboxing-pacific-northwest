                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just rolled in from a wonderful trip packing with llamas in the<br>
Wallowas. Since my partner and I have been together for nearly a<br>
million  years, unlike the newly hitched Mudstumpers, I DID manage to<br>
find time to hide a letterbox in the area. The stamp image was drawn<br>
in an alpine meadow filled with wildflowers as I stood face to face<br>
with my favorite llama. The carving was done that evening at the<br>
campfire. The clue will follow soon.<br>
<br>
On the return journey, we stopped at Deadman Pass and stamped into<br>
Heather's box. The carving is way cute. Being subtle in that rest area<br>
is far from easy, especially when the park guy is watering the lawn,<br>
trucks are coming and going and a Winnebago pulls in every thirty seconds.<br>
<br>
Before we left on our trek, we spent a couple nights in Central OR. I<br>
excitedly hit the trail looking for the boxes hidden along the Redmond<br>
Dry Canyon Trail by the mysterious new boxer, "Birder." Box 1 was an<br>
easy find but the second eluded me. The "dead wood prevails' but I<br>
didn't. All I managed to find was some really rank porn hidden in a<br>
crevice and a bunch of trash. Instead of leaving with a new stamp in<br>
my book I left with a lovely collection of garbage to deposit at the<br>
nearest trash can. Funhog<br>

The Nail Family, on 2 seperate occasions, have found porn while <br>
boxing.  In one incident someone had actually replaced a letterbox<br>
that we had placed with lewd pictures.  This was especially upsetting <br>
because the box in question was especially designed for children.  We <br>
pulled the clues from the website (with the help of the webmasters) <br>
and replaced the porn with a message about the area being watched by <br>
authorities.  Since then, the hiding spot in question has been taken <br>
over by a geocache.  <br>
<br>
Why does this kind of thing always happen when there are children <br>
involved?<br>

Triple Falls has grafiti and was trashed; it used to be a beautiful, peaceful haven.  We had our car broken into and items stolen, and per the police they do it for mere pocket change, and there is porn being left on trails as well as sent in email to the unsuspecting.   Morals were removed from schools along with prayer and the Pledge of Allegience.  We were very discouraged by all these things.   Anyway, there is our warning to be careful out there! <br>
