                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we had our first little adventure letterboxing in the dark.  We were in <br>
the Clackamas area for a Campfire event and decided to get the "You've Got <br>
Mail Box" by Pandora.  We had one of my Campfire girls with us and she thought <br>
this was a blast.  Even though this was not hidden in a beautiful park, we told <br>
her that we would have to take her out sometime.  It is so fun to share this <br>
hobby with friends and family.  I have started our student helper at the <br>
school I work with going out too.  He tried to get the box on the Discovery Trail <br>
here in Vancouver, but did not realize that he needed a compass.  He will go <br>
back again he said.  Happy Thanksgiving to all.  Willow and family.  <br>
