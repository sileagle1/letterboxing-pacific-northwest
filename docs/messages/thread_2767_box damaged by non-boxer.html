Vernon, WA has been compromised.  Box #1, jiggler, was found with a <br>
NEEDLE in it and a note mentioning drugs.<br>
<br>
I am so very disappointed as these are my first boxes and it happened <br>
so soon.  Is this a common occurance?  Are there many other stories <br>
like this?  I didnt ever think that even in little ol' Mt Vernon <br>
something like this would happen.<br>
<br>
I have moved away from the area and although I have someone who is <br>
going to retrieve it tomorrow, I wont be able to find a new hiding <br>
spot very easily.  If anyone wants to go ahead and try for the bonus <br>
box, feel free to message me and I will send you the missing clues <br>
from jiggler.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any advice or stories,<br>

do go missing now and again but drug related incidents are few and far<br>

new location. Funhog<br>
