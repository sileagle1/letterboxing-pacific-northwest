I just walked through the door, returning <br/>
from checking on these two oldies. They <br/>
are doing just fine and awaiting your visit! <br/>
Granted, the gardeners made the Crystal Springs <br/>
box WAY more difficult to find by covering up <br/>
its loose stone camoflage but I've unearthed <br/>
it. On the other hand, the sneaky owl was even <br/>
a wee bit exposed. I could see the box even<br/>
before I removed any covering material.<br/>
<br/>
The rhododendron gardens are absolutely stunning <br/>
right now, well worth a visit. This place has <br/>
got to be the only place I've been where you can <br/>
get within five feet of a redwing blackbird or a <br/>
wood duck and the canopies of flowers defy <br/>
