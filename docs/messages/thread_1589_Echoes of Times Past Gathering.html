Good afternoon<br>
<br>
Team Chaos and Team Rayvenhaus have begun planning the second annual FF2:<br>
Booooo-gie in the Park - Echoes of Times Past Gathering for Oct 23rd 2004,<br>
which is the Saturday before Halloween, from 10:00am till 4:00 pm (or later,<br>
the park doesn't close till 1/2 hour after sunset), at Millersylvania State<br>
Park, just ten miles south of Olympia and 3 miles from the I5 freeway. There<br>
will be at least 2 series newly planted in the park, along with the existing<br>
boxes that are already there.<br>
<br>
What we would like to also offer is for anyone who can not make it to this<br>
gathering but would still like to participate in some way, to go ahead and<br>
carve up a themed stamp, make a box and ship it to us and we would be happy<br>
to plant and maintain it, listing you as the creator of that box. If you'd<br>
like to take us up on this, contact RayvenMom at rayvenmom 'at' lbworld.org<br>
and she'll give you the snail mail address to send it to.<br>
<br>
We invite everyone that can make it to come and join us, meet some of the<br>
people behind the posts. There will be a potluck so please bring a covered<br>
dish, a salad, something to eat, enough for your group and share with your<br>
friends. Bring your own sodas or other assorted drinks, (minus alcohol of<br>
course, this is a dry park).  Although this is a Halloween themed gathering,<br>
this is not a costume party of any sort.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br>
<br>
