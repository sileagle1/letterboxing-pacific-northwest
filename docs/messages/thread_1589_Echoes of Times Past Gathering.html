Good afternoon<br/>
<br/>
Team Chaos and Team Rayvenhaus have begun planning the second annual FF2:<br/>
Booooo-gie in the Park - Echoes of Times Past Gathering for Oct 23rd 2004,<br/>
which is the Saturday before Halloween, from 10:00am till 4:00 pm (or later,<br/>
the park doesn't close till 1/2 hour after sunset), at Millersylvania State<br/>
Park, just ten miles south of Olympia and 3 miles from the I5 freeway. There<br/>
will be at least 2 series newly planted in the park, along with the existing<br/>
boxes that are already there.<br/>
<br/>
What we would like to also offer is for anyone who can not make it to this<br/>
gathering but would still like to participate in some way, to go ahead and<br/>
carve up a themed stamp, make a box and ship it to us and we would be happy<br/>
to plant and maintain it, listing you as the creator of that box. If you'd<br/>
like to take us up on this, contact RayvenMom at rayvenmom 'at' lbworld.org<br/>
and she'll give you the snail mail address to send it to.<br/>
<br/>
We invite everyone that can make it to come and join us, meet some of the<br/>
people behind the posts. There will be a potluck so please bring a covered<br/>
dish, a salad, something to eat, enough for your group and share with your<br/>
friends. Bring your own sodas or other assorted drinks, (minus alcohol of<br/>
course, this is a dry park).  Although this is a Halloween themed gathering,<br/>
this is not a costume party of any sort.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br/>
