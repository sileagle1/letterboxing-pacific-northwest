<br/>
Having grown up in Bellingham, I can tell you that it's a beautiful place.  Although I have not been able to find this particular box series, you'll most definitely want to try the Larrabee State Park Lb series.  It is absolutely gorgeous late spring, summer and early fall.  The boxes that I did find were the Geri Field, the Interurban Trail Series, and the Badtz-Maru Parasite.  My parents still have a house near Whatcom Falls Park - I did attempt to find the one in that park since it was so close.  This is another one that I would highly recommend not just because of the Letterbox, but the falls that are in the park are breathtaking. I spent quite a bit of time in that park playing tennis and watch people cliff jump.<br/>
<br/>
Just a little history - the bridge that crosses the falls was originally built in 1935.  The Indian word "whatcom" means "noisy waters".  When you visit, you will understand why!! :) <br/>
<br/>
If you have time, the series up and around Western Washington University (Sehome Hill, the Badtz-Maru Parasite), the view over Bellingham Bay is great!!! :)<br/>
<br/>
As far as restaurants go, my favorite is Hong Kong Garden on Meridian (they just built an oriental store on to the restaurant which is really nice) and El Reconcito on Yew St..  There's a great cafe on Lincoln St. right by Cost Cutters grocery store - great for breakfast.   Cruisin' Coffee has the best mocha shakes around!!!<br/>
<br/>
I know that's a lot and I could go on and on.  Feel free to let me know if there's any more information that you'd like!!! :)  There are many websites for Bellingham - www.bellingham.org, www.cob.org, or you can find a lot of information about it on wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your travels through the great northwest and on into Canada!! :D  Make sure you try an Aero bar while up in Canada!!! :)<br/>

Hi there, <br/>
 Although I have not seen all the boxes here in the lower mainland, and <br/>
have enjoyed all of those I have visited,  I can make a few suggestions <br/>
to you. <br/>
Some favorites include: <br/>
Come Sail Away by Gecko girl and her guy<br/>
Clothing Optional by Norasta<br/>
Singin In the Rain by Norasta <br/>
Snuggling Snorklers by Kurious Jo <br/>
Lover's Walk by Lion's Mane<br/>
All have wonderful stamps!<br/>
You cannot go wrong with any boxes done by CSB bc, she is an excellent <br/>
carver and all of her boxes are well worth the time.<br/>
I hope you enjoy your visit and do not hit the rain that is expected <br/>
this weekend!!<br/>
Cheers, <br/>
Zara<br/>
<br/>
