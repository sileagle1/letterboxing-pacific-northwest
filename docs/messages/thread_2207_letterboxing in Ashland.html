Shakespeare series and Romeos Ex LBs in Ashland, OR. These are <br>
awesome stamps..go get them!!!To find Romeos Ex we thought was gonna <br>
give us some difficulty but after just a few minutes of some careful <br>
brain storming, we figured it out and found the right location on the <br>
first try! We both bought brand new (matching bikes) and rode them <br>
all over the park, even though they are not allowed (how can bikes <br>
NOT be allowed in a park??) but we never got in trouble, even saw a <br>
cop or two but they didnt bother us. However, we did carry our bikes <br>
up and down several flights of stairs before we realized that we <br>
didnt even need to carry the up the final flight of stairs (the <br>
longest flight) and we laughed so hard we nearly dropped them and <br>
drestroyed our new bikes. We had a great time, so much fun!! <br>
Sorry I havent gotten my falcon pictures posted yet from a few weeks <br>
ago, I am currently working 3 jobs now..ugg... and havent had any <br>
time to get them up, but Ill try to do it soon :) 2 of my jobs end <br>
the last week of september WOOHOO!! so then I will be back down to <br>
one job. If I get wednesday off (doubtful) Im going LBing on highway <br>
138, gonna go to Toketee Falls,hot springs, watson falls, susan <br>
falls, and might even make it to diamond lake. Anyone that hasnt made <br>
it that way, I highly reccomend it, you will not be dissapointed by <br>
this series of waterfalls and LBs! :) I hope and wish and pray I can <br>
get wednesday off, but not likely, I couldnt even get my birthday off <br>
(saturday) you'd think I work in a child labor sweatshop <br>
thingamajigger haha  I guess its all self induced though... why oh <br>
why do I make myself work so much... I gotta stop that or I might get <br>
old before I know it!! its time for me to go play :) <br>
