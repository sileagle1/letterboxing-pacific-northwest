<br/>
No hiking necessary<br/>
Stroller Friendly<br/>
Easy <br/>
<br/>
Butterflies don't have mouths with which to chew or eat.  Instead,<br/>
they have a proboscis, which is like a straw, that they use to sip<br/>
nectar and juices.  They don't taste with their proboscis, though. <br/>
Butterflies taste with their feet!<br/>
<br/>
You'll find the third butterfly in the Butterfly Collection Series<br/>
sipping nectar if you'll follow the clues below.<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox location:  Wildwood Park <br/>
23rd Ave SE and 9th St SE,<br/>
Puyallup, Washington	<br/>
<br/>
Directions to letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
There is no hike involved in this hunt.  You'll be parking within just<br/>
a few feet of the letterboxes location.  The challenge lies in<br/>
choosing a time when people will not be around because finding the box<br/>
discreetly will be impossible otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Choose a time of day, week, or year when the picnic shelters in the<br/>
park are not likely to be in use.  (The middle of the week during the<br/>
day is pretty good.)<br/>
<br/>
Upon entering the park take the first right turn following the arrow<br/>
for the play area.<br/>
<br/>
Next follow the sign to Shelter #7.<br/>
<br/>
Park right in front of Shelter #7.<br/>
<br/>
Look for the tree with the mossy claw on the right side of the<br/>
shelter.  The claw guards This butterfly while she sips her lunch. <br/>
She's well camouflaged, so look carefully.<br/>
