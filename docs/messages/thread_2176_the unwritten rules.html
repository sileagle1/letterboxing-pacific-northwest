I'll put my 2cents in about the "no rules" side of<br>
this hobby.  There are most definitely rules - they<br>
may not be in book form but they are there and the<br>
minute you break one you are busted.  <br>
<br>
There are a lot of veterans in this hobby who will let<br>
you know if you're out of line.  At the same time the<br>
integrity of this hobby is at state when people start<br>
breaking these unwritten rules and therefore someone<br>
has to make sure people stay in line - for the most<br>
part.  <br>
It's just like having a Daddy who keeps you on the<br>
straight and narrow until you're old enough to begin<br>
making your own decisions and understanding the impact<br>
of those decisions affects not only you but everyone<br>
around you and those who come after you.  <br>
<br>
I had to look at this hobby in that way as I was an<br>
overzealous boxer last year who wanted to conquer the<br>
world AND all the letterboxes - simple and complex -<br>
in one fell swoop.  I also saw some things "needing<br>
assistance" and the mother in me stepped right into<br>
action.  YIKES!!!!  I was too new to be making<br>
parental decisions about other people's "babies". <br>
<br>
So, my suggestions are simple and few:<br>
<br>
Find it, enjoy it, and put it back so it isn't seen<br>
and can be found again.<br>
<br>
Fix it if you can with what you have on hand then let<br>
the box parent (the placer) know about the damage and<br>
what you did.<br>
<br>
Do not remove anything from any box unless it is a<br>
first finder or a hidden clue.  If something is wet,<br>
moldy, or full of porn sayings - alert the box parent<br>
so they can "choose" whether or not to do something<br>
about it. NOTE - offer to assist if they are unable<br>
but never say you're going to do it.<br>
<br>
Finally, don't use someone else's clues as a jump<br>
point for yours nor nab their verbage for yours.  BE<br>
CREATIVE! We want to see your own flare and style.  We<br>
already know the flare of the vets - so strut your own<br>
style and you may end up in the end as one of those<br>
who is still kicking around in a few years.<br>
<br>
Okay - that may have been a buck worth....sorry.<br>

I found a box completely destroyed a few weeks ago, on a 10-mile <br>
hike, lots of elevation gain.  The log was soaked.  I could have <br>
replaced the log, the box, and dried/mailed the 4 logged-in pages to <br>
the owner, who doesn't live nearby.  I realize that maintenance is <br>
his responsibility, but I could have saved him a trip and such a <br>
long hike...  I was only the 2nd person to log in in 2 years, the <br>
4th since it was planted in 2002 or 2003.  <br>
<br>
I guess it would have been nice to save the owner a trip and a long <br>
hike, that's all.  In the end, I decided it wasn't my place to take <br>
the log, but it truly was useless, nearly unreadable.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree that it would've been a nice thing to do. I have <br>
taken a soaked book home and dried it out, later <br>
returning it to it's home. If a book is totally waterlogged, <br>
I bet most placers would want you to take it out of the <br>
box, dry it and send it to them as long as you left a r<br>
eplacement in the letterbox. <br>
<br>
Recently, I received an email about one of my boxes <br>
in the East. The finder discovered the book soaking <br>
wet, removed it from the plastic baggy and then left <br>
it in the box to mold. I am only able to get there once <br>
a year for maintenance. I would've much preferred that <br>
they took it with them, returning it to me. This way, it <br>
will be useless by the time I get there. I, for one, do <br>
believe in taking a log with me if that's the best first aid <br>
option. I would never keep it but I would try to preserve <br>
it. Funhog<br>
