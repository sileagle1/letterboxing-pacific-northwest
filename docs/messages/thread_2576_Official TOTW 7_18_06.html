Great question for TOTW -- Where have you been, whether hiking, on <br>
vacation, road trip, whatever -- when you realized AFTER you got <br>
home that there had been a letterbox there?  <br>
<br>
Myself -- Warm Springs Teepee.  I went to Eastern Oregon several <br>
months ago, passing by the box but didn't have the clue with me.  <br>
Then I went back to Eastern Oregon a couple weeks ago, had the clue, <br>
and couldn't find it....  no laughing out there!  I'll find it I <br>
will...<br>
<br>
A few people emailed in with new TOTWs, so I'll post them in coming <br>
weeks.  Thanks everyone!<br>

  TOTW is the Topic of the Week.  Things got slow last winter on this list, so we decided to prod some conversation into action.  We're still not terribly lively, it seems, but I guess if that means we avoid the infamous "drama of the main list," that's not such a bad thing.<br>
   <br>
  Again, welcome to the hobby and have a look around.  There are good resources on both letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com for beginners, and other people have glossaries for you to look up stuff about which you might have questions (though I don't think TOTW is covered on any of them, so that's a valid question...).  Sometimes some people get a little bored of the same ol' questions, for whatever reason, so it'd probably be best to do a lot of browsing and reading to get familiar with everything.<br>
   <br>
  By the by, if you're letterboxing anywhere near where you work, and there are several there, you might want to check out some of the "Mystery Boxes" in the state, county, and city...<br>
   <br>
  Good luck!<br>

Don't worry - I'm a researcher and an old hand to mailing lists (I've<br>
been online in one way or another since the late 80s).  I promise not to<br>
ask a bunch of stupid questions to rehash. :)<br>
<br>
Looking forward to heading out and about in Tacoma this weekend to find<br>
all of everyone's works of art.<br>

How about New York and Connecticut? I discovered letterboxing one year after<br>
I did a four month internship in New York, Conn, and New Jersey.  It killed<br>
me, I could have had so much fun.<br>
<br>
I also discovered the NPS Passport stamp series weeks after returning from<br>
New York only to find that there were at least five or six stamps just in<br>
the immediate area that I was living in in upstate New York.  That was a<br>
rub!!  They are in an area that I highly doubt I'll get back to anytime<br>
soon, if at all.<br>

<br>
I hope that I am allowed to do this (re-visiting a past TOTW).<br>
<br>
 I was too ashamed and depressed to admit this at the time of this <br>
topic until today.  Read on; I think it will be entertaining...<br>
<br>
I was on my way to the Mariner game with a friend 3 weeks ago. I <br>
decided to stop and show him Dick and Jane's Spot in Ellensburg. We <br>
were chatting with the ever-friendly Jane and I decided to tell my <br>
friend about letterboxing. I thought his family might enjoy it if <br>
they found it interesting. I sat my wife's digital camera down on <br>
the fence while I was fiddling with something and talking. Needless <br>
to say I forgot the camera. We decided to stop on the way home being <br>
reasonably sure it would still be there. Wrong! My heart was in my <br>
socks. <br>
<br>
I contacted Jane the next day via email and she nicely checked and <br>
didn't see it nor had anyone turned it in. I couldn't bring myself <br>
to tell my wife for several days and when I did she clasped her <br>
heart and gasped. Then I asked (due to her reaction) how much it had <br>
cost and her response was "you don't want to know". (maybe this <br>
should be my answer on the Atlasquest survey for 'what is the depth <br>
of despair'). I was mortified.<br>
<br>
 To my wife's credit she didn't really get ticked at me, but it took <br>
me awhile to start to get over it. We even got a new (cheaper) <br>
camera yesterday.<br>
<br>
Here is the real entertainment... So today a co-worker of mine <br>
(Homeport)and I decided to go find a LB with another co-worker(today <br>
was her first LB) at lunch. Homeport told me that she had stopped in <br>
Ellensburg with her family to find the LB at Dick and Jane's Spot. I <br>
thought that was nice but said "Wait until you hear MY story about <br>
Dick and Jane's Spot" and proceeded to tell her about the lost <br>
camera. She stopped me and said "I have your camera". This,of <br>
course, didn't register with me because I thought she meant she had <br>
just stopped there really recently so she must be joking. She then <br>
asked me what kind it was and ... well you get the rest of the <br>
picture. Speaking of which, I wish I had a picture of the look on my <br>
face when I realized the truth! She had no clue that it was 'my' <br>
camera. I had found the letterbox a few months ago and several other <br>
LBers had been there since. She even contacted as many of the other <br>
LBers as she could via email!<br>
<br>
I will get the camera back tomorrow and be able to return the new <br>
one to the store as well. <br>
<br>
Homeport is a saint!<br>

PS Lesson learned; Use a case with a neck/shoulder strap for these <br>
new smaller digital cameras so that you are less likely to set them <br>
down. Yikes!<br>

Wow, what luck, getting your camera back.  You are very fortunate!<br>

Maybe it's because I found it during the summer, when I wasn't taking classes, but there were days that summer I spent the whole day out, 7AM to dark, then was still so excited my friend and I couldn't get to sleep until about 1AM, but were still out at 7AM and rushing to the car to not get locked into a park at dusk.<br>
   <br>
  Ever hear of the Pacific Northwest's (or maybe it's just Washington, but I thought Oregon was in on it, too) Quilt Shop Hop?  Each quilt shop participating designs a quilt square using a few fabrics and colors and a theme, and people go to all the quilt shops and get the pieces for these squares for free.  Then they put all the pieces together as they like, and they have a quilt from all over the state or region.  They also do a drawing, but you have to have 16 or so stamps from all the shops you visited.  My mom and I went to a bunch in this area to get stamps for my aunt, and I kept getting them in my letterboxing book.  DEFINITELY some looks of, "Ok, you're really weird..." from the quilt shop ladies.  I even made my mom go to a particular shop because they had a mouse stamp I'd seen in somebody else's passport.<br>
   <br>
  We're definitely a unique breed...<br>
