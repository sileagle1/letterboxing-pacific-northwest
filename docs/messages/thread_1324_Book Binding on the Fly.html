<br/>
I have adapted my first letterbox, Mee-Kwa-Mooks Low Tide, in West Seattle,<br/>
Washington. Amanda from Seattle was looking after it, but has graciously<br/>
let me take it over. She adapted it from Jill-the-Reckless, the original<br/>
planter.<br/>
<br/>
Jill made a great stamp, for those who haven't seen it. She also hand-made<br/>
a small journal that is quite beautiful. The cover is handmade paper and<br/>
the inside stamping paper is hand torn watercolor paper. It has finally<br/>
filled up with visiting stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than start a new journal, I was able to add more pages with<br/>
watercolor paper I already had. I hand-stitched them in by copying the<br/>
original pages and stitching. It was a much bigger chore than I expected as<br/>
I have never done any binding like this before. It's not nearly as pretty<br/>
as Jill's work, but it is functional and added 20 pages to the back of the<br/>
journal. Now folks visiting can still see the history of stamps since the<br/>
box's beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Reading glasses, thimbles, strong thread, a needle and trial and error got<br/>
me through. A bit of work for sure, but it keeps a beautiful journal at the<br/>
ready for the next visitor.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails.<br/>
