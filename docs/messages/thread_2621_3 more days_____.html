We missed you when you were in Portland last time.  Ironically we're off to<br>
Canada and the Puget Sound area to letterbox.  It'd be a miracle if we met<br>
up since our trip is tight scheduled but if you see a bearded guy with a<br>
short blond carrying bags with LBNA patches on them, that could be us.<br>
We'll be in Federal Way camping and boxing in Dash Point S.P getting there<br>
sometime after noon on the 27th.  On the 28th and 29th we'll be staying at<br>
relatives in Montesano and not sure if we're boxing in Olympia or Quinault<br>
area.<br>

If not hope to meet you guys some day.<br>
