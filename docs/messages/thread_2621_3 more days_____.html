Some of the areas we'll probably visit include Seattle, Bellingham,  <br/>
Olympia, Issaquah, North Bend and Steilacoom. Not sure if we'll make <br/>

We missed you when you were in Portland last time.  Ironically we're off to<br/>
Canada and the Puget Sound area to letterbox.  It'd be a miracle if we met<br/>
up since our trip is tight scheduled but if you see a bearded guy with a<br/>
short blond carrying bags with LBNA patches on them, that could be us.<br/>
We'll be in Federal Way camping and boxing in Dash Point S.P getting there<br/>
sometime after noon on the 27th.  On the 28th and 29th we'll be staying at<br/>
relatives in Montesano and not sure if we're boxing in Olympia or Quinault<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
If not hope to meet you guys some day.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We missed you when you were in Portland last time. Ironically <br/>
&gt; &gt; we're off to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Canada and the Puget Sound area to letterbox. It'd be a miracle if <br/>
&gt; &gt; we met<br/>
&gt; &gt; up since our trip is tight scheduled but if you see a bearded guy <br/>
&gt; &gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; short blond carrying bags with LBNA patches on them, that could be us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We'll be in Federal Way camping and boxing in Dash Point S.P <br/>
&gt; &gt; getting there<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometime after noon on the 27th. On the 28th and 29th we'll be <br/>
&gt; &gt; staying at<br/>
&gt; &gt; relatives in Montesano and not sure if we're boxing in Olympia or <br/>
&gt; &gt; Quinaultarea.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If not hope to meet you guys some day.<br/>

&gt; &gt; ... until we're on our way to Seattle for 2 weeks of hiking &amp; boxing!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks to those of you who sent us some hike recommendations, we can't<br/>
&gt; &gt; wait to get out on the trails!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Some of the areas we'll probably visit include Seattle, Bellingham,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Olympia, Issaquah, North Bend and Steilacoom. Not sure if we'll make<br/>
&gt; &gt; it down to Portland area for some more boxing in the Columbia River<br/>
&gt; &gt; gorge, but we're bringing lots of clues along. We'll see where we end<br/>
&gt; &gt; up....<br/>

&gt; We are only about 3 hours from Seattle. <br/>
&gt; If it fits, it fits, if it makes life crazy, then don't do it.<br/>
&gt; Are you travelling by car? camper?<br/>
&gt; enjoy your trip.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually, after reviewing a map, it probably IS too much of a <br/>
&gt; long <br/>
&gt; &gt; shot.  We have plans to meet some friends in Seattle on Sunday <br/>
&gt; at 3pm, <br/>
&gt; &gt; so it would be a long drive up Saturday, only to have the same <br/>
&gt; drive <br/>
&gt; &gt; back on Sunday.  We do hope to be up as far as Bellingham later <br/>
&gt; in our <br/>
&gt; &gt; trip though.<br/>
