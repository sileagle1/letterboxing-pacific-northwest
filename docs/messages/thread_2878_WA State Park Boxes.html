                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yea . . .  guess I didn't clarify about the SP rules.  Maybe they've loosen<br/>
them.  Last time I read them you had to physically check on the box every 3<br/>
months (not possible in my case) and had to renew the permit every year.  I<br/>
suppose for the young whipper-snappers in the group the rules work.   They<br/>
stop me from placing in a SP . . . . but they don't stop me from hunting<br/>
there!!<br/>

Well, actually, letterboxes and geocaches ARE allowed in Washington State <br/>
