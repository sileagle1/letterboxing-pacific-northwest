I noticed something else that was a bit peculiar.  Apparently, someone  named <br/>
"Mysteryplacer" had visited these boxes and added bonus stamps to them  all. <br/>
Maybe I misinterpreted... were there two stamps in each box when you  planted <br/>
them, Val? Has anyone else noticed any similar activity in the  area?<br/>
