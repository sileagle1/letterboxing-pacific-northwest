    Ok so we all know the advantages of letterboxing and why we do it <br/>
and so many others just dont understand, the hiking 10 miles on a hot <br/>
summer day drenched in sweat and aching muscles and getting dirty, <br/>
but when you find that little box, its all worth it, right? I love <br/>
the hike, like I am sure you all do, and due to this sport I like to <br/>
think to myself I have become a fairly good hiker, (not quite Ryan or <br/>
Godlike hiker though) well this is much to my advantage. Well for the <br/>
first time, wednesday, I was forced to hike a very very very long <br/>
ways completely against my will. My boyfriend Luke and his friend <br/>
Chris drove a jeep waaaaaaay up into the mountains with no snow <br/>
chains and evidently early in the morning when the top layer of snow <br/>
was frozen, that was ok but around 11am the jeep just fell into it, <br/>
yup, they were driving along and whoops, it just dropped into several <br/>
feet of snow and of course to top it off they broke the transmission <br/>
upon trying to get it out. <br/>
<br/>
  Well I had just gotten home from a very strenuous, and fun, hike <br/>
and walked in the door, jumped in the shower and was interrupted by a <br/>
phone call from a certain boyfriend begging me to come save the day. <br/>
Well being the wonderful woman I am, I jumped in his oversized jeep <br/>
that I can barely drive or see over the steering wheel, and headed up <br/>
in the middle of nowhere to save the boys. At one point I could drive <br/>
no further so I stopped and waited for them to come down the mountain <br/>
and find me and after an hour or so they did. <br/>
<br/>
    Being quite exhausted I wanted to go home, but no, we drove into <br/>
town, got the parts to fix the busted transmission and headed back up <br/>
the mountain, this time with tire chains. So we get up there and were <br/>
able to drive to the busted jeep and lo-and-behold Chris left his <br/>
jeep keys back in town, 30 miles away!!!! (ever wanted to kill <br/>
someone?) so as we turn around in the snow and try to head back to <br/>
town, this jeep fell several feet into the snow also (oh joy) and <br/>
after several hours of shoveling well into the night, not too mention <br/>
the cougar tracks in the snow all around us, we came to the <br/>
conclusion that we must hike out. darn. I was wearing tennis shoes <br/>
and already had frozen feet and a fear of frostbite and was certainly <br/>
not dressed for cold weather. <br/>
<br/>
   So we start hiking out in 4 feet of loose snow where every step <br/>
was a challenge, and it was only 5 or so miles, but the hardest I <br/>
have hiked in these condiitions. Well into the night, freezing <br/>
weather, me totally unprepared, no food, water, warm clothes, and a <br/>
cougar close by, and here we had to hike down a mountain because the <br/>
men didnt use snow chains the first time up the mountain. Thats why <br/>
Luke needs a woman like me, to tell him when to stop being macho and <br/>
use the darn snow chains!! well too late for that though... I was <br/>
ready to get home and was hiking ahead of everyone else (they were to <br/>
slow and kept complaining) so I guess this is the part that I am glad <br/>
that I hike alot because I think it was easier on me than the less <br/>
adventerous people lagging behind me in the snow. <br/>
<br/>
  Chris kept saying "I'm tired, lets stop and here and wait for <br/>
someone to find us" well I just about kicked him in the head. No one <br/>
was coming to get us, no one knew where we were, and when Luke and <br/>
Chris first drove up the snowy mountain, they were making fresh <br/>
tracks in the snow, nobody had been up there in a long time. So I <br/>
told him in a very ladylike manner that we couldnt stop because we <br/>
would freeze to death and/or become cougar food :o) well this helped <br/>
him move along...slowly...  but eventually we made it out of there <br/>
(obviously) alive. Although I dont plan on hiking with these two <br/>
complainers anymore and I think Luke will stop asking me why I like <br/>
to "torture" myself by hiking, well obviously it did some good for me <br/>
to stay in shape and healthy, otherwise I would have been a frozen <br/>
popsicle being consumed by a rather large kitty :o) <br/>
**************************************************************<br/>
Please remember guys, its not "girly" to stop and put on tire chains, <br/>
do it, cuz I  ain't about to come save anyone elses butt's hahaha<br/>
