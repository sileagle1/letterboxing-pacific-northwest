Hey All,<br/>
<br/>
I think I might have been following Fudrick around... well I took my lunch <br/>
break and headed to the Tumwater Historical Park.  I found the water water <br/>
everywhere box, but unfortunately, I think the bonus box is missing again.  <br/>
There was no bench there, but the "T's" were there... couldn't find <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
After work, I went back to the park and found the Oly Beer and the magic <br/>
wand box.... I had a great time!  Thanks everyone for the great finds....<br/>
<br/>
Jessi<br/>

ended and there were 2 metal T's where a bench used to be.... I looked under <br/>
the T's...  is that the right place?<br/>
<br/>
What time did you take lunch... because maybe I was at that 1 first... I was <br/>
there around 12... and couldn't find it... I'll have to go back there <br/>
tomorrow now... ohhhh that's going to bug me now....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know about the Brau House stamp... I'll look for that one too... <br/>
uhhhh....<br/>
<br/>
I heard about Fudrick's service... Thank you... I might have to take you up <br/>
on it if I'm just missing them like that.... *grinz*<br/>

<br/>
I got there about 2:00 in the afternoon.  Went to Water, then the Bonus.  Was there then, I put it back where I found it.  Interesting placement, but should be safe.  Give it another try (or five :-), <br/>
<br/>
Remember - reasonable rates!!!<br/>
