:P<br/>
<br/>
As we drove into the parking lot yesterday, I noticed the cachers right off<br/>
the bat.  They're always the ones standing together, and then get a wild<br/>
hair and rush off w/o much rhyme or reason... and at least half of them<br/>
have a gps in hand.<br/>
<br/>
However, I wasn't sure how I was going to figure out just WHO these<br/>
letterboxers were.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, CrabbyDaddy and his crew were just getting out of the<br/>
car for a walk (toward the letterbox area) as I was getting my goods<br/>
together to head over to the cachers.  My thought was to meet with them<br/>
first, make arrangements for the day, and then walk out the Dirt Works<br/>
trail to see if anyone was out there.<br/>
<br/>
As I was making my way around for 'hello's', I noticed a woman I'd not yet<br/>
seen at any of our recent gatherings talking to a group of folks I did<br/>
know.  I asked her who she was and she said she was a "letterboxer just<br/>
waiting... WAIT!  You're CurmudgeonlyGal!"<br/>
<br/>
It was perfect.<br/>
<br/>
I SO enjoyed meeting with you Bethany and talking... and talking... and<br/>
talking...  She gave me my first THREE exchanges and I gave her my LAME<br/>
'caching' stamp.  (My excuse is that I've been THRUST into this a little<br/>
mo' quicklier than I'd intended so I haven't yet carved my own!)  We found<br/>
out we have a LOT in common (box hunting aside) and I just enjoyed myself<br/>
thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure, had neither of us had other pressing engagements, we'd still be<br/>
standing in the park talking.<br/>
<br/>
On my way out (my caching friends were getting impatient!) Bethany told me<br/>
the man/kids/dog I'd seen on my way in WAS another letterboxer and that I<br/>
just couldn't leave w/o getting more stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Aaaaaagh!<br/>
<br/>
I had to show everyone my stamps (including the missing Byrd Square) over<br/>
the course of the day, relate the story, and marvel at just how cool these<br/>
stamps are!<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU for such a wonderful intro to this hobby!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
michelle<br/>
...curmudgeonlygal<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Bethany...  I don't suppose your hubby would be interested in taking a<br/>
caching travel bug (our geocaching hitchikers) with him to K would he?<br/>

Oh, did you happen upon any letterboxes during the poker run?  I <br/>
received a couple of notes about folks finding remnants of <br/>
letterboxes around the area on Saturday.  It's rather bizarre--on <br/>
Sat, GC folks found remnants of two 'It's Raining Animals' <br/>
letterboxes that went missing several months ago!  Not sure how <br/>
these boxes reappeared on the scene so many months later?  Another <br/>
mystery just begging to be solved...<br/>
<br/>
Again, it was so nice to meet you.  Thanks for taking the time to <br/>
grab the stamp from its world travels and to send it along its <br/>
homeward journey.  Welcome to letterboxing!  Can't wait to see new <br/>
Aberdeen LBs on the scene in the future!  I've got a handful of <br/>
ideas for new LBs in your area--just need to get some time to re-<br/>
explore the spots and do some research so you'd have 'interesting' <br/>
clues to follow.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails...<br/>

Forgot to mention 'the land of the street roasted grubs' or 'the <br/>
land of sun dried squid &amp; octopi'--one of our favorite delicacies <br/>
while carousing the streets of its capital!  NOT!!!  ;)  Perhaps <br/>
that's an idea for a new letterbox series?  Interesting and odd <br/>
cuisine from around the world...<br/>
