and will not be reincarnated (or is it better <br>
said 'reinfishnated')?  I don't know if anybody ever found the <br>
couple of iterations of this box.  The park is just not that 'normal <br>
people' friendly and I don't want to encourage others to wander the <br>
trails there anymore without police protection nearby.<br>
<br>
Sorry so many of you were frustrated about this one,<br>
