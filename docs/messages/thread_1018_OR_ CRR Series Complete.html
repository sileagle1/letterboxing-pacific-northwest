No, I'm pretty sure you are the very first. Of course someone else may have snuck <br>
down into the Crooked River Canyon for #3 since we you found that one but I doubt <br>
it.<br>

<br>
That stamp makes me laugh. It reminds me of Anton Apollo Ono... Don't you just love <br>
it that the first finders came all the way from Indiana? That spot is killer for spring <br>
flowers.... but the view will take your breath away in any season. Now I need to figure <br>
out how to get down into that Squaw Creek Canyon. It's just screamin' for a letterbox <br>
if you ask me. Funhog<br>
