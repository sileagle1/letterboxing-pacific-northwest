up with a fella named One-Eyed-Willie, a handsome devil if I do say!<br>
Then we had a lovely picnic lunch at Indian Head in the sunshine.  After<br>
that we headed south and went Round and Round and then gained Seaside<br>
Happiness.<br>
<br>
It was a delightful day.  Much thanks to The Fleshmans, Miller and Hutch<br>
(gotta get more of their boxes if they have them out there) and<br>
Heather!!!  Very special carves that everyone should have in their<br>
logbooks!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
