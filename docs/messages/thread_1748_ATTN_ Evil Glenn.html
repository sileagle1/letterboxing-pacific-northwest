I was just trying to pull up clues to some of your letterboxes and some of<br>
Trail N Error's letterboxes and get a page not found on all of what used to<br>
be good links.  Did you guys pull all your clues or move them somewhere?<br>
<br>

Help please!<br>

This is a shame.  It is partly the evil of Glenn that drove me to dark<br>
side.<br>

Not sure what's going on but I'm sorry to see you leave.  You <br>
inspired and challenged me during a time when the rest of my<br>
life seemed to be unraveling.  Hopefully, you're doing well and plan <br>
to reappear on the letterboxing scene in the future.  I'm sorry to <br>
see your website evaporate as well--it's really a great mix of <br>
Sherlock Holmes style intrigue and mystery.  Your photography was <br>
extraordinairy!!!  I'm definitely going to miss embarking upon the <br>
virtual adventures with which your camera lens blessed us!<br>
 <br>
Hats off for a job well done on all of your boxes!  I loved the <br>
challenges and the way you wove such great clues into such awesome <br>
treks to beautiful spots around the Sound.  I would never have <br>
visited many of these spots had it not been for your boxes.   Sorry <br>
to see you go!  After all, without your boxes, I'd never have <br>
embarked on this hobby (perhaps that's your impetus for departing <br>
the scene?).  I hope & pray that it isn't!!! :(<br>
<br>
Godspeed!<br>

Are you leaving the hobby?  Say it ain't so.  I hang my head with<br>
sadness.  I have so many questions but don't want to assume you are<br>
leaving.  I'm thinking...hey I wanted to try to find some more of<br>
Trial-n-Error's boxes.  Will they still be around?  Will you list the<br>
clues elsewhere?  If not, do you want people to adopt your boxes?  <br>
