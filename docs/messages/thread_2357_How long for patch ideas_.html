get my art pencils out and work on something I have in mind but am<br>
really short on time this weekend.  Where did the other patch with the<br>
words spelled out (letterboxing pacific northwest) go?  I am really<br>
hoping we end up with one that spells the words out rather than LbPNW<br>
- I think it will make for much better<br>
conversation/interaction/learning/teaching when someone who doesn't<br>
know anything about it sees the patch on me.  I like to talk about<br>
letterboxing to people, but I find they often think I'm saying<br>
"litterbox" for a while.  If they can see the word before we start<br>
talking things might be easier.  They are also more likely to go home<br>
and do some research of their own if they have actually seen the word<br>
"letterboxing" rather than just LbPNW.  My two cents on that subject.  <br>
