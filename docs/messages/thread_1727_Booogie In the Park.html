Many thanks to Team Rayvenhaus, Iron Bear, Pandora, Camp Fire Lady and<br/>
Maiden for providing another most entertaining and successful<br/>
letterbox event.<br/>
<br/>
We were blessed with very pleasant weather (most of the time) to the<br/>
chagrin of the local weather prognosticators.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun meeting several letterboxers that were new to me and yes<br/>
Bison, I did see that note you posted in one of the logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the barbecued hotdogs and hamburgers with all the fixings,<br/>
love that stuff.  The Cooties - they're wonderful! I have more fun<br/>
with those than the kids do and managed to snag eight of the twelve.  <br/>

<br/>
Letterboxes everywhere, a special thanks to all the folks who took the<br/>
time to place boxes for this event  more than I was able to find<br/>
in<br/>
one day so will be planning a subsequent trip.<br/>
<br/>
Really enjoyed seeing everyone again and visiting with some of you and<br/>
I look forward to the next gathering.<br/>
<br/>
You all did a splendid job putting this one together and I had a great<br/>
time (despite the harrowing experience of crossing the Columbia<br/>
-twice).<br/>
