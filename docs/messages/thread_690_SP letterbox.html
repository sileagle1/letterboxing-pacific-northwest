<br>
<br>
(You'll need to figure out a few things to find this box...)  <br>
<br>
Did I snub God to hand Edna  _ _ _   _ _ _   _ _ _ _?  I did.              <br>
<br>
If the letter indicated by the first blank above is:<br>
<br>
c: the box is in Milo McIver State Park <br>
e: the box is in Forest Park<br>
h: the box is in Tyron Creek State Park<br>
p: the box is in Hoyt Arboretum<br>
t: the box is in Mary S. Young State Park<br>

On a sunny day in the Pacific Northwest, four letterboxers set out to find a box.  Each carried something different, and each used a different colored inkpad.  Letterboxer A carried a hitchhiker and the letterboxer who carried the first aid kit had a green inkpad. Letterboxer C did not carry gloves and Letterboxer B did not carry a bottle of water, Letterboxer D had a blue inkpad. The letterboxer carrying gloves did not use a red inkpad and Letterboxer B did not <br>
have a green inkpad. Which of the letterboxers had a yellow inkpad?<br>
<br>
If it is A: Take the trail that includes the word “west.”<br>
If it is B: Go north on the deciduous tree trail.<br>
If it is C: Go south on the coniferous tree trail.<br>
If it is D: Take the trail that includes the word “east.”<br>
<br>
<br>
One of these things is not like the others.  Which one?<br>
1) IBIS<br>
2) IBEX<br>
3) PIKA<br>
4) ORYX<br>
5) ZEBU<br>
<br>
If the odd one out is:<br>
1) From the culvert/creek, go 23 steps.<br>
2) From the seven-trunked cedar tree on the left, go 19 steps.<br>
3) From the culvert/creek, go 52 steps.<br>
4) From the seven-trunked cedar tree on the right, go 12 steps.<br>
5) From the giant root wad on right, go 9 steps.<br>
<br>
<br>
Complete this sentence:<br>
<br>
My very educated mother just served us nine…<br>
<br>
1) kumquats<br>
2) tennis balls<br>
3) court summons<br>
4) pizzas<br>
<br>
If it is 1, the box is under the larger of the two rocks directly to the east.<br>
If it is 2, the box is tucked under the bark (south side) of the downed cedar at 235 degrees (magnetic).<br>
If it is 3, the box is on the right, under the third board.<br>
If it is 4, the box is tucked well under the south side of the log on the left of the trail.<br>
