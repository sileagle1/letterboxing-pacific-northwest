in western Washington.  There is much to see and do, but<br>
this time we concentrated on Mt. Ranier and the San Juan<br>
Islands, one of our favorite places to visit and escape<br>
the Texas summer.  Though my wife is a non-letterboxer,<br>
I snuck in a few finds and even hid one on Orcas Island<br>
(just missed being the first by a few weeks).  Here is<br>
a list of the boxes I attempted and their status:<br>

I edited the clues sheet to say clue is hard not medium to hard.<br>

You passed by it on the way up ( and back) to other boxes.<br>

Ah, that was just a clue ;-)<br>

Next time you are in the area give a yell.  We love any excuse to <br>

did not look for clues on that trail.  Oh well, maybe next time.<br>
Speaking of next time, I may get to come to Seattle this November<br>
for a conference so maybe I could meet some of you Northwest boxers!<br>
I'll let you know when I know for sure and what date.<br>
