Owwww!<br>
Hi, Went letterboxing with my two kids yesterday. We still have a <br>
very little bit of snow here. Had my son in a carrier on my back and <br>
a hold of my daughters hand. The trail was pretty dry, but there <br>
were a few icy patches. I kept telling my daughter to hold tight to <br>
my hand and be careful of the ice patches. Well, I was trying to <br>
avoid them, but alas I stepped on a small one and went down. My left <br>
leg went behind me and I landed kind of sideways. The bottom of the <br>
pack held me up so that I didn't break my leg. Both kids are just <br>
fine. I called my husband and he asked me if he needed to come and <br>
get me (he was at work). I told him let me try to stand up. I was <br>
able to get up and very carefully limp my way back to the car, about <br>
a half mile away. Went to the ER and I avoided telling them about <br>
letterboxing. Just explained I was hiking. Can I get this PLB?<br>

<br>
    Not to be unsympathetic, but I had to smile.  I<br>
did the same thing a couple of weeks ago on some slick<br>
wooden steps.  I had a technicolour bruise the shape<br>
(and size!) of Louisiana on my backside.  It's a<br>
tricky time of year for this hobby!  I'm glad you and<br>
your kids are okay.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
