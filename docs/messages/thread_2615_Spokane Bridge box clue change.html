had to change the clues to the pesky (Hants aq ilpench) -Spokane<br/>
Bridge Series, again. So, print new clues out if you plan on  looking<br/>
for them.  One of the boxes had another mishap and needed moving, so<br/>
that's two with new clues since we planted them. The boxes are all<br/>
there, except the Five Cent Stamp that went down the river this spring.<br/>
