The Haunted House is not missing. We found it with no problem and <br>
Bethany's WA Territorial Assylum and my Fledgling box. <br>
<br>
What was missing was The Model boat Letterbox and the Leschi Gallows <br>
box. I was surprised Leschi Gallows was missing. Perhaps a squirrel <br>
pushed it out or something. <br>
<br>
We also found: <br>
Aunt Beth, Heath Farm, Ryan's Pirate Treasure, the Waughop, All Four <br>
Clowns, and RIP.<br>
Then we went into "downtown" Steilacoom and got Byrd Mill, Salter's <br>
Point and Pioneer Park. And we  got the Seaplane box!<br>
<br>
We also got two Pacific Northwest Mystery boxes today!!<br>
And Lea picked up Molly looking for Ginger HH! (after Molly's <br>
encounter with a Waughop!)<br>
<br>
Today, we are on our way to Canada and will stop along I-5 in the <br>
Bellingham area for some boxes too!<br>

<br>
What is it with that tree?  Bethaney has replaced it once already?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the update.  I am glad the Waughop had a buddy for a <br>
while. <br>

Thanks for the update, need to get back there and check on mine (and get the<br>
rest :-)<br>
<br>
I looked for the Leschi Gallows, found the tree, stood on my tiptoes to try<br>
to reach it, but is wasn't there.  I stepped on something, a rock maybe?<br>
No, it was a letterbox.  It was laying on the ground, so logged in (of<br>
course) and put it with the Insane Asylum (appropriately) and let dvn2r ckr<br>
know so she could replace or relocate it.  Haven't seen the new site yet.<br>
<br>
Sorry we couldn't make it last Saturday :-(<br>
