Eagle Fern Park. We found Buffalo Baby A&amp;W. We imagined Fishing <br/>
Whippet to be near by, but sad to say we never foung the perfect <br/>
place to sit. We thought maybe Sleepywhippet was taking lessons from <br/>
Funhog, and when she said to "go West", we should just keep going <br/>
till we arrived at the Pacific Ocean, but even that did not work.<br/>
Hope the recent fallen tree next to the riverbank was not the hiding <br/>
spot. It was still nice to get out in the fresh air. We look forward <br/>
to retuning there in the summer to play and swim in the creek.<br/>
