We have two rooms at Luke AFB - Fort Tuthill.  I had<br/>
no idea that place was there!  Plain - but cheap and<br/>
perfect for the family.  It appears as if we can rent<br/>
snow tubes and go TUBING!!!!  Guess I need to pack the<br/>
boots and snow bibs and coats because it isn't warm<br/>
there! OUCH!  41degrees.  I'm not even sure how to<br/>
pack for this trip because it seems, even though it's<br/>
70 degrees here, it sure isn't warm anywhere we are<br/>
going.  YIKES!<br/>
THANKS for the advice!<br/>
<br/>
I thought about travelocity but I need flexibility<br/>
when it comes to where we are staying.  I need to be<br/>
able to cancel if our mileage doesn't pan out the way<br/>
I have it planned and with those websites where you<br/>
name your own price - that isn't always the case. :0)<br/>

If only everything good in life could be contained in a letterbox and could then be found by those who seem to only experience the bad.<br/>
