that live or online, you're a great bunch of folks.  For all the<br>
occasional blow up we have, this is a group of people who, in general,<br>
support letterboxing in all it's flavors -- from occasional boxer to<br>
avid 5000 count and still counting -- and I LOVE that about this<br>
group...<br>
<br>
I just ran into a relatively new boxer who got told he's not welcome on<br>
a list of what I can only assume are very self important jerks who told<br>
him he's not "serious" enough as his PFX count isn't high enough for the<br>
length of time he's been involved.  Leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.<br>
<br>
I just thought someone ought to tell you (from one who's count is stupid<br>
low for my time in the hobby, but life gets in the way sometimes) that<br>
you're a really great bunch of folks.<br>
<br>
Thanks :><br>

It's nice to see you back in the LB realm again.  Looking forward to <br>
hearing about any new boxes you may place.  Just trying to find a <br>
way to find your Maui boxes someday soon--still have to come up with <br>
a business 'reason' & $$$ to get there.  ;)  Sorry you missed the <br>
Stamp Camp event in your neck of the woods a few weeks back.  <br>
Perhaps you can join us at the upcoming Echoes of Past event (that <br>
is if we're in town then)?  Thanks for your nice comments.  Nope, we <br>
haven't found or planted a million LBs yet--I think we've probably <br>
looked for about 1,000 to date--unfortunately, our 'find' total is <br>
no where near there--subtract a few hundred from that for <br>
our 'connect' success!  At the rate our boxes go missing these days <br>
I think our Planted total will soon quickly shrink as well.  I guess <br>
folks are really desperate for tupperware & stamps these days in <br>
Pacific Northwest!  Take care,  <br>
