that live or online, you're a great bunch of folks.  For all the<br/>
occasional blow up we have, this is a group of people who, in general,<br/>
support letterboxing in all it's flavors -- from occasional boxer to<br/>
avid 5000 count and still counting -- and I LOVE that about this<br/>
group...<br/>
<br/>
I just ran into a relatively new boxer who got told he's not welcome on<br/>
a list of what I can only assume are very self important jerks who told<br/>
him he's not "serious" enough as his PFX count isn't high enough for the<br/>
length of time he's been involved.  Leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought someone ought to tell you (from one who's count is stupid<br/>
low for my time in the hobby, but life gets in the way sometimes) that<br/>
you're a really great bunch of folks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :&gt;<br/>

It's nice to see you back in the LB realm again.  Looking forward to <br/>
hearing about any new boxes you may place.  Just trying to find a <br/>
way to find your Maui boxes someday soon--still have to come up with <br/>
a business 'reason' &amp; $$$ to get there.  ;)  Sorry you missed the <br/>
Stamp Camp event in your neck of the woods a few weeks back.  <br/>
Perhaps you can join us at the upcoming Echoes of Past event (that <br/>
is if we're in town then)?  Thanks for your nice comments.  Nope, we <br/>
haven't found or planted a million LBs yet--I think we've probably <br/>
looked for about 1,000 to date--unfortunately, our 'find' total is <br/>
no where near there--subtract a few hundred from that for <br/>
our 'connect' success!  At the rate our boxes go missing these days <br/>
I think our Planted total will soon quickly shrink as well.  I guess <br/>
folks are really desperate for tupperware &amp; stamps these days in <br/>
Pacific Northwest!  Take care,  <br/>
