                    <div class="plaintext-content">4 members of Team Run-A-Muck set out Sunday to find the Marshall Park <br>
Series and Tryon Creek Series. All 5 of Marshall Park Series are <br>
alive and well including clues for a mystery box. Tryon Crekk was <br>
another story. What a hike! I am still trying to recover. Found High <br>
Bridge with no problems, Bird Watcher was a little more tricky but <br>
when it was found there was some hootin and hollerin goin on, Red Fox <br>
Box was a tough climb. The "older" members sat this one out and sent <br>
the kids up the hill only to find that the brush was so thick they <br>
couldn't get to it, Iron Mountain was a no find all together since we <br>
couldn't figure out what Der Mad Stamper meant by a "disk". Any help <br>
on the last two boxes would be greatly appreciated. Took the clues to <br>
the Orphan Box but never made it that far. After hiking for 5 hours <br>
we were wiped out! I did walk away with a nice pair of Ray Ban <br>
sunglasses found off the side of the trail though. Anyway, 7 out of 9 <br>
boxes isn't too bad. It will just take a whole week for my knee to <br>
heel.<br>

Hey, I thought we were supposed to be discreet about finding boxes???<br>

It's been awhile since I found this one but when I was there there was no bushwacking <br>
involved. There were actual small but clear trails.<br>

<br>
Think about the definition of the word. Plus the counting is somewhat confusing.<br>
<br>

<br>
Not bad at all.<br>

Yes bushwacking is involved no one uses the trail except for boxers and adventurers, and the landscape has altered, the tree fell.  But the directions are still true just a bit more tricky to find.<br>
 <br>
We didn't use the "disk" part of the clue at all, in fact, we ignored that part entirely, but after we found the box, we commented, "oh, there there's a disk!"  But we also came at it from the opposite direction.   <br>
