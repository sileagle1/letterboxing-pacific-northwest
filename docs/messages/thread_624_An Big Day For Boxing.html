office where I planted the "You've got mail" letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Then we were off to find some Lost Park somwhere in OR.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed out to the Washington Park area and planted not 1 not <br/>
2 not even 9 but 12 letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
And you know what -- somehwere in the corse of the day a Hitch Hicker <br/>
that was traveling with me decided to go her own way. I hope she <br/>
doesn't get lost.<br/>
