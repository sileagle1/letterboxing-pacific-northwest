<br>
"Miss Janet" is Ryan's creation, who does indeed welcome you to a list of <br>
Lbing dos and don'ts (watch out for her drill sergeant pal, tho!).  I don't <br>
recall her web address, but am sure Ryan will chime in if he reads the post--a <br>
search of the main list archives would also reveal it.  <br>
<br>
I'd suggest there's a wider spectrum than the two boxing-types you mention, <br>
tho I think you're right that they exist.  I really enjoy/obsess over the <br>
challenge of the cryptic clues, but happily go after other boxes as well.  I'm <br>
delighted that Pandora planted a series of TWELEVE boxes--I also like the idea of <br>
Ryan's you-get-a-box-after-a-six-mile-hike (altho, right, I haven't gotten <br>
that one yet).  A Pink Pearl stamp is dandy--it's the image you've created on it <br>
that interests me--altho if you've seen my signature stamp, you'll know I'm <br>
not that snobby ;o).  <br>
<br>
Boxing here in the middle of the pack is good.    <br>

I don't really see it like that.  I see it more as a spectrum where <br>
each of your camps is on opposite sides of the spectrum, but then are <br>
are plenty of boxers and boxes that fall between them.  For instance:<br>
<br>
1. Mischief is famous for her stunning stamps, but likes to place <br>
them on easy hikes with simple clues.<br>
<br>
2. I'm infamous for placing stamps that require long, strenuous <br>
hikes, but if I'm the first person to start hiding boxes in an area, <br>
I deliberately make them more accessible and use simple clues to <br>
introduce new people to the hobby.<br>
<br>
3. Der Mad Stamper can carve some INCREDIBLE stamps, but he's also <br>
notorious for ugly foam stamps--claiming to have placed those so as <br>
not to intimidate newcomers and show that a stamp doesn't have to be <br>
a masterpiece to be worthy of a letterbox.<br>

<br>
I've started trying to gather "unspoken rules" on my website at <br>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb as various sorts of <br>
documentation, but even then much of it is still debateable.  For <br>
instance, on my page about what makes a great letterbox great, <br>
there's plenty of debate regarding what makes a good clue.  My <br>
favorite boxes tend to have elaborate clues that can be very <br>
difficult to solve, but that wouldn't be a good idea for a box that's <br>
meant for beginners or kids.  In that case, a simple, straight-<br>
forward clue would get the job done better.<br>
<br>
I think--and I could be wrong--but it seems to me that the two camps <br>
you see are the difference between "adult" boxes and "kiddy" boxes.  <br>
There's nothing inherently wrong with either type, but they certainly <br>
are designed for two very different kind of audiences.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
I am unsure if anyone else has answered this as I receive the group emails<br>
in the digest format, but thoughts I would attempt to explain my perception<br>
of the whole thing to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
First of all I do believe that you are correct in your interpretation of a<br>
difference in style in the letterboxing community. I think you will find<br>
more subcategories than the ones you list however.  For example there are<br>
those that are very prone to using compass readings in their clues vs. those<br>
that use paces, steps and clear concise directions.  There are those make<br>
you hike miles for one stamp and those that give you the stamp in the<br>
beginning of a trail head and then allow you to decide how far along the<br>
trail you wish to go from there.  There are those that do very cryptic clues<br>
and easily hid stamps and visa versa.  There are those that do both.  As for<br>
carvings I would say that in that aspect also lays a vast variety of what is<br>
done based some on time, some on potential and skill, and some on the<br>
overall desire and purpose of the carver in question.  Personally I do many<br>
of the above things.  My clues are sometimes cryptic; they are sometimes<br>
straight forward and to the point.  My carvings are sometimes varying<br>
detailed, and sometimes, when carving something on the spur of the moment<br>
they are simple.  I even have some carvings that appear very childish in<br>
artwork and style, as I had Iron`Bear's 7 year old daughter draw the image<br>
and carved it exactly as she drew it.  My Family Photo Letterbox for<br>
example.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To answer your question I do not think there is anything wrong with being a<br>
Newbie to the sport. As a matter of fact if you have been a member of the<br>
group long you will notice I once proclaimed myself the permanent Newbie of<br>
Letterboxing in an attempt to stick up for other Newbies out there.  I think<br>
that old time letterboxers welcome Newbies to the group quite openly; it<br>
allowed them to actually hunt boxes rather than planting them all the time.<br>
Just ask Ryan about the SLO area.  Until last year Ryan was just about the<br>
only one planting anything there.  Then a group of enthusiastic Newbies came<br>
along and now Ryan can hardly keep up with finding everything that is<br>
getting planted out there.  I think however you feeling and desire for a<br>
website on how to behave in the letterboxing community, list wise, post<br>
amount, language and so forth is a little dramatic.  I don't mean that to be<br>
offensive, I just think that basically it is all about common sense.<br>
Perhaps I just had experience on other lists before joining this one and new<br>
a little more of net etiquette so to speak however.  In an attempt only to<br>
help I will make the following suggestions. I am not saying you have done<br>
any of the following, just responding to your questions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Always make your subject line descriptive about your post so it can be<br>
skipped over by those that are not interested.<br>
<br>
2. No need to post a zillion messages a day to the board unless you are<br>
responding to other emails.  Try to put more than one thought in your posts<br>
to condense a little and so that the list doesn't seem flooded with your<br>
name in their email boxes.<br>
<br>
3. Don't flame and attack on the message board, if you have a problem with<br>
someone take it off the list and discuss it there so you don't make yourself<br>
look like an ass in front of the rest of the group as well.<br>
<br>
4. Don't just jump right, sit back awhile and see how the board flows, what<br>
the other members do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As to your other questions... I would say plant as many boxes as you like,<br>
make the clues as hard or as easy as you desire, post site reps if you want<br>
to just make sure to tell so in the subject line so that those that don't<br>
want to read them can skip them.  Keep in mind that if all your clues are<br>
easy, all your stamps are simple, and you plant lots and lots of boxes, your<br>
boxes may not appeal to the letterboxer looking to be a little more<br>
challenged.  Is there anything wrong with that? Nope, not at all.  But then<br>
don't piss in their cheerios if they feel that way either.  That is their<br>
right just as yours is to do what feels good and brings you joy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Last but not least I would suggest that you don't post things you don't want<br>
replies to, don't ask questions you don't want answers too, and don't ask<br>
for opinions if you only want ones that agree with you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for Miss Janet's Rules -- I don't have her website handy, but if Ryan<br>
reads your post or my reply he will probably pipe in and tell you how wrong<br>
I am and how my opinions all go against Miss Janet's Rules, and he would be<br>
the most educated in Miss Janet's List Conduct since she is a figment of his<br>
imagination. <Wink><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I bid you well,<br>

I've just returned from a visit with Miss Janet, and she is most <br>
offended at you calling her a figment of my imagination.  ;o)<br>
<br>
However, she thinks your posts are most charming, sincere, and well <br>
thought out.  She wasn't quite so kind with my posts, though.  <br>
*sigh*  At least I didn't have to drop and give her twenty like <br>
General Hardass always does.  =)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Right ON!  That's a great description of where I am -- love both the hard 'uns and the groups -- they serve different purposes and i enjoy them all.  I've hiked to the top of mt. fu (read rattlesnake ridge) for 1 box and walked discovery park for 6 boxes in less than a mile (pictures only for clues -- that was a blast!) and enjoyed both immesely.  We've planeted the 9-stamp series for kids and newbies and folks with shorter time allotments and we're planning a couple of stamps on a 10 miler that *starts* at the top of rattlesnake ridge (ok, i'm still getting in shape for *that* one :>).<br>

lovin' bein' in the middle of the pack 2!<br>

Hi Cami,<br>
<br>
"Miss Janet" is Ryan's creation, who does indeed welcome you to a list of <br>
Lbing dos and don'ts (watch out for her drill sergeant pal, tho!).  I don't <br>
recall her web address, but am sure Ryan will chime in if he reads the post--a <br>
search of the main list archives would also reveal it.  <br>
<br>
I'd suggest there's a wider spectrum than the two boxing-types you mention, <br>
tho I think you're right that they exist.  I really enjoy/obsess over the <br>
challenge of the cryptic clues, but happily go after other boxes as well.  I'm <br>
delighted that Pandora planted a series of TWELEVE boxes--I also like the idea of <br>
Ryan's you-get-a-box-after-a-six-mile-hike (altho, right, I haven't gotten <br>
that one yet).  A Pink Pearl stamp is dandy--it's the image you've created on it <br>
that interests me--altho if you've seen my signature stamp, you'll know I'm <br>
not that snobby ;o).  <br>
<br>
Boxing here in the middle of the pack is good.    <br>
