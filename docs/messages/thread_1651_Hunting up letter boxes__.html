We, the RHOG Stamper and I, had a great Friday of letterboxing.  We left<br/>
Teri-Anne the Packdog home, the RHOG stamper has a new car and doesn't want<br/>
dog hair in it, imagine that?  I don't think that I have ever bought a car<br/>
that wasn't bought for the comfort of my dogs... but I digress...<br/>
First we fed the ducks while looking for the Quackerbox series in Albany,<br/>
this is where I was chased by a flock of geese... very exciting!!!   Then we<br/>
were off to find the Bookworm letterbox also in Albany, which by the way is<br/>
really cool and worth finding!!!<br/>
Then it was off to Eugene for Bucky the Beaver, The Eugene Skinner box , the<br/>
Sisters (which we couldn't find) and then back to Peoria for the Snab Boat<br/>
bend (replacement).  All in all it was a great letterboxing day!!!  We had<br/>
very nice weather and the sights at Skinners Butte, although kind of smoggy<br/>
was nice.<br/>
I hope everyone else had as nice a weekend and I.<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>
