because I can seldom find a box the first time... the ones at PCC RC had me<br>
completely stumped for a while (although I hear they are no longer there??)<br>
<br>
I have never heard of a non internet repository! LOL... I think you are kind<br>
of on your own... I know it is hard to figure out where some of the 'areas'<br>
that boxes are placed are... and I don't think there is a 'right' or 'wrong'<br>
way to do it...<br>
<br>
Just make sure you do a 'zero impact' search (zero impact on the<br>
environment) so you don't tick off the locals!<br>
