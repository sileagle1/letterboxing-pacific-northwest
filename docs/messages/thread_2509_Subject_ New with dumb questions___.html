because I can seldom find a box the first time... the ones at PCC RC had me<br/>
completely stumped for a while (although I hear they are no longer there??)<br/>
<br/>
I have never heard of a non internet repository! LOL... I think you are kind<br/>
of on your own... I know it is hard to figure out where some of the 'areas'<br/>
that boxes are placed are... and I don't think there is a 'right' or 'wrong'<br/>
way to do it...<br/>
<br/>
Just make sure you do a 'zero impact' search (zero impact on the<br/>
environment) so you don't tick off the locals!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; First and foremost...clues??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you all just search find a few you're interested in and copy the<br/>
&gt; clues into your logbook, or print them out or what?? Is there a non-<br/>
&gt; internet repository out there somewhere?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know...silly, silly, silly...but I have little people to mentor and<br/>
&gt; want to do this right and encourage good habits from the start.  Thank<br/>
&gt; you, Judith<br/>
