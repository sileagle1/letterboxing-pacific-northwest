But I see that Canada Goose's boxes are listed as abandoned--as well as <br/>
Pandora &amp; ironbear's Powell's City of Books box (altho that's still AWOL, right?).  <br/>
I know from the main list that Pandora's in the area now and on the mend--and <br/>
I'm hoping Canada Goose is still in the game.  Sol Stamper's boxes are on the <br/>
abandoned list--as are the Forest Peoples'--who are definitely still boxing.<br/>
<br/>
What's everybody thinking about this subject?<br/>
<br/>
(To check out the list of abandoned boxes: On the LbNA website, go to "Search <br/>
for Boxes."  Choose Oregon, then choose "Abandonedbox" for the placer.  It's <br/>
a loooong list...)<br/>

I dug up the clues for Der Mad Stampers 4 boxes out at Rock Creek <br/>
Campus, and plan to go out tomorrow and check on their status.  One <br/>
report was that some were missing, so I'll find out and let you know, <br/>
so I guess if they are still healthy then I'll adopt this series.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend that one or two persons don't try to adopt too <br/>
many of any abandoned boxes out there, or we could simply be left <br/>
with the same scenario in the future if they too loose interest.  If <br/>
we spread it out among many folks, it shouldn't be such a hassle if <br/>
someone wants out.  Capeech??<br/>

After looking at the list, the only ones we have found so far are the West <br/>
Linn (Mom, Mexico, and Me) boxes by Canada Goose.  We can adopt those if nobody <br/>
else wants them, unless Canada Goose comes back and wants them!  Does anyone <br/>
know their email address?  Or has anybody been in contact with them to let them <br/>
know what's going on?  <br/>
