                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went in search of the Spruce Goose today (McMinnville, OR), with <br/>
nine-year-olds Button &amp; Wild Child.  I'm sorry to report that I think the box is <br/>
missing...but we found other very cool things instead in this little airport park.  <br/>
The Mushroom House (wow, with cave paintings!) &amp; shell fountains mentioned in <br/>
the clues were wonderful--and some other visitors to the park showed us the <br/>
madrona home of a little Pacific treefrog.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, I've seen many a treefrog in my day, but despite the name, I have never <br/>
found one in a tree.  According to the folks who showed it to us, they've <br/>
found a treefrog living in that tree for several years now.  It's gone during <br/>
mating time--otherwise, someone's usually home--and sometimes more than one.  So <br/>
if you go to this park, watch for a lovely, large, several-trunked madrone tree <br/>
growing right beside the trail.  Its trunks spread out low enough to the <br/>
ground that it is obviously quite inviting for people to climb into--you can see <br/>
how the bark has been worn smooth by lots of feet.  There's a little hole in <br/>
one of the trunks, facing toward the trail.  It's maybe about 3 feet above the <br/>
ground.  If it's been raining, you may see a frog looking out the hole <br/>
(presumably it's on the porch because the house is flooded).  If it's been dry, you <br/>
can gently stick your finger into the hole, and "tickle" the frog out--sorta <br/>
crook your finger &amp; wiggle it, it'll hitch a ride and come out for a visit.  The <br/>
young man who showed us this trick has tickled 3 or 4 frogs out at a time!  <br/>
Okay, so maybe you hafta be kind of a naturalist/tree-hugger/Mark Trail/Annie <br/>
Dillard type to do this--but hey, you are, aren't you???!!<br/>
<br/>
A frog in the hand in an interesting replacement for a stamp in the book.<br/>

P.S.  I've already e-mailed A. Rose, placer of the Goose--hopefully she'll <br/>
report that we are inept and the box is in place...<br/>
