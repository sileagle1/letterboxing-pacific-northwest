boxes in the park were a joy to find, all of the wonderful new friends, the<br/>
food, and the kids. I loved watching the kids. The cooties were a kick too<br/>
:-) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ill have to go back to Priest Point, I missed most of the Century boxes,<br/>
and a couple that were planted today. Its such a beautiful park though,<br/>
its no hardship to go back. <br/>
