http://www.vernoniafloodinfo.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
Like Funhog said, my house was not affected but the town can <br/>
certainly use help. I've been pointing people to Vernonia Cares, the <br/>
food bank: http://www.vernoniacares.org/ but there is now a fund at <br/>
Wauna Credit Union too. Contact number for that is on the blog. <br/>
<br/>
With over 200 homes destroyed and over 400 damaged (out of about 900 <br/>
in the city), there is plenty of need in town. The flood in 1996 was <br/>
supposed to be a 500 year flood, and many folks did not have <br/>
insurance not expecting a reoccurance in thier lifetime.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are just fine  - thank you for thinking of us, Pilgrim.   Although were<br/>
on the flat prairie, we dont have water problems here.  The ground percs<br/>
very well. We had snow all day Saturday (the 1st) then 2  of rain the next<br/>
2 days.  40 mph winds during the 1st wind storm on Sunday and even less on<br/>
the 2nd storm.  Much of western WA got 15 of rain in 3 days (according to<br/>
one newscaster).  What started out as freezing temperatures and snow in the<br/>
mountains melted as temperatures shot up to near 60 the following days.<br/>
Parts of the coast got 130-150(?) mph winds. Several wind gages broke so<br/>
wind speed are unknown in those locations. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As luck would have it Wood-aug &amp; his sister, HumpTea, needed to move their<br/>
G-mas things out of her assisted-living apartment in Spokane that weekend.<br/>
Spokane is 7 hours from here on a good day.  On the way W-a went up to<br/>
Montesano (between Olympia and the coast) to pick HumpTea up. Fortunately<br/>
they beat the snowstorm over the Cascade mtns. Monday, due to the weather<br/>
they decided to drive here (Vancouver, WA) first via the Tri-cities<br/>
(Richland/Pasco/Kennewick) then go up to Monte.  That day I-5 closed but<br/>
it was a good decision, anyway.  HumpTeas Hubby and son (USS Pizza) were<br/>
stuck at home without power or water for days and no generator.  HT &amp; W-a<br/>
were able to get one in Portland even though they were flying out of the<br/>
stores quickly.  They drove it up north Wednesday  normally 2 hrs one way -<br/>
turned into 5 hrs with the Morton detour.  I was very thankful when W-a made<br/>
it home that night.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Soapbox alert: Portland TV stations appear to be geographically challenged <br/>
they dont cover WA state news!  We had a terrible time figuring what route<br/>
to take north.  On the internet the various agencies are giving conflicting<br/>
info concerning the detours and roads conditions.  Now over a week later and<br/>
we still have no idea how areas in WA State are doing as all PDX news wants<br/>
to talk about is Vernonia.  Grrrrr.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the up-side,  HumpTeas letter today said that there are some pretty neat<br/>
stories  free food, water, Home Depot selling generators at cost (once they<br/>
got there), etc.  She said that the PUD guys are gaining hero status after<br/>
5+ days of 24 hr work.  Shes expecting PUD action figures complete with<br/>
trucks, cherry pickers, spools of cable &amp; flaggers!   Funny lady!<br/>
