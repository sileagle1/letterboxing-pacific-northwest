<br>
First off to anyone that's going to do the Upper Macleay boxes.. PATIENCE is<br>
a HUGE deal.  I couldn't believe how busy the trail was. It was hysterically<br>
funny trying to look casual and hide everything every time people went by.<br>
(About every 10 seconds)...<br>
<br>
And the more important one.. the third box.. the White Fronted Bee Eater or<br>
something like that.. is in fact there.  The clue has it listed as possibly<br>
missing.  It is not.. it is in its original spot and happy as a clam. BUT BE<br>
CAREFUL WHEN LOOKING FOR IT.  We found several hyperdermic needles on the<br>
ground imbedded in the mud right near it.<br>
