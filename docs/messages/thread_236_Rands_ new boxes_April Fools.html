Park, Oregon City.  We, too, headed out there today and nabbed these<br>
sweet little stamps for our logbooks!  It has been a popular set since<br>
being placed just days ago!  Those logbooks have 5 stamps in them<br>
already.  Nice little out of the way park.  We want to bring grandkids<br>
out to find these beauties.<br>
<br>
By the way, Funhog, that's another cute signature stamp you've got.<br>
I've got two of your others in my logbook.  Maybe in July I can get your<br>
new one inked in my book when we exchange at the gathering, eh?<br>
<br>
We also went to Angry Park in Happy Rock, but came up empty-handed.<br>
Some people were picnicking right next to where the LB might be, so<br>
maybe in the future we'll go back and see if it's where we're hoping<br>
April Fool's might be.  All other probable searches proved fruitless.<br>
<br>
