The Fort Vancouver LB is doing just great.....sitting in the front <br>
seat of my Jeep with me.<br>
<br>
With my apologies....(greatly extended to CampFire Lady & company) <br>
I'll get back to replace it. I have a course in Vancouver on <br>
Saturday the 20th so I will get it back that afternoon. (Really <br>
CampFire, really!! [she's heard that before]).<br>
<br>
I will make a general post to the board on Saturday to advise that <br>
it has been returned. Sorry I hadn't updated the clues to reflect <br>
the box being "out".<br>
<br>
Hope to return to LBing soon<br>

Thank you Soggy2pair. I am patiently waiting for the return of the <br>
Fort Vancouver letterbox. If anyone would like to find another of <br>
Soggy2pairs boxes try the one at Lewisville Park in Battle Gound. It <br>
has a beautiful stamp but it is very lonely. While you are there <br>
check out my new Happy Postman series of 6 boxes. It would make a <br>
great snag of 7 letterboxes in one day!<br>
