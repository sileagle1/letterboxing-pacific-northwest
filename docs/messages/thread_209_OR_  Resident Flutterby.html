Placing boxes instead of finding them?  You'll get no complaints from me <br/>
(except regarding the inherent cruelness of a no-clue box)... <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Its funny.  When I created it in "Add A Letterbox", I was worried it would be <br/>
too easy for y'all to figure out, because it seems obvious to me!  I've done <br/>
other clues that I thought would be pretty difficult and yet were a piece of <br/>
cake to the searchers.   Sounds like I finally created a challenge?<br/>

I hope if/when anyone finds it you will let me know! <br/>
