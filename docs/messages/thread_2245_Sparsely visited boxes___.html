                    <div class="plaintext-content">Keeping along the thread of discussion about boxes that don't get many <br/>
visitors right away, if ever--I've kept a mental note of the boxes <br/>
we've planted over the past few years.  One box had been hidden for two <br/>
years with nary a visitor until 'poof!' it experienced a flurry of <br/>
visitors after an article ran in a local newspaper in that region.  <br/>
What's worse is that it initially contained a HH that sat idle for a <br/>
year until we rescued it on a maintenance trip to ensure it was still <br/>
there because we hadn't heard anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of more recent examples--we hid a box a year ago and it has <br/>
only had one group of visitors to date.  We also hid two this past Jan <br/>
and both have yet to have any visitors some 9.75 months later.  Another <br/>
case of an idlin' HH involved in one of these.  These boxes aren't <br/>
in 'far flung' places either, so it's a bit perplexing. ;) The hobby <br/>
seems to be 'cyclical' though as it seems to run in spurts around media <br/>
attention/WOM.<br/>
<br/>
So, you just never know...<br/>
