Lake.  Because of the snow, most were unavailable.  But I did find one <br>
and gave it some TLC, was full of water.  I've posted 3 pictures from <br>
the trip - what a beautiful place.  We visited Crater Lake too.  Not <br>
sure how many feet of snow there, but there was a lot.  Wizard Island <br>
is amazing.<br>
<br>
I planted a couple boxes at Diamond Lake (where the snow was only a <br>
foot or so in some places).  I'll get them posted as soon as I can get <br>
the clues written.<br>
<br>
Diamond Lake is a must-see place that everyone should visit, sooner or <br>
later.<br>
