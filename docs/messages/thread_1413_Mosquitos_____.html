Take care all and pack that repellent in your letterboxing gear!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow I didn't know someone got the Nile Virus in California - I do know that<br>
the mosquitoes are in full force this summer. I hope people keep this in<br>
mind when planting new boxes this season and try to keep us away from the<br>
highly infested areas. I know that mosquito bites are not fun for anyone and<br>
I am allergic to them, so I too have made repellant a staple in my bag this<br>
season.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
So far the only box that I have knowingly and willingly stomped through<br>
mosquito infested areas for was Lemony Snicket. And I was very appreciative<br>
of the warning Mr. Snicket gave us that there would be tons of little bugs<br>
wanting to bit us and leave red sores on us because we were able to go<br>
prepared.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I don't mind doing stuff like that if I know ahead of time - <br>
<br>
Just my two cents - not worth much more than a couple penny's<br>
