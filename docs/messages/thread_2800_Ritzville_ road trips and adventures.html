                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Thunderbird, you didn't miss a thing.  Wood-aug's placement in Ritzville is missing so Ritzville was added to the subject name.   Hx6 is doing a road trip though Portland.  So you lucky birds get to travel to Montana again, hey?   We're hoping to make a trip to Spokane again this year.  I'd like to do some boxing over the Idaho border there.  If I'm not mistaken (no surprise if I am LOL) aren't there some new boxers in ID now?  Or are they down south further?       <br>
<br>
Thank you for sharing your letterboxing story, Colls.  Letterboxing brings adventure to life, hey?!   . . . but then there are those moments in the dark and cold where you wonder how you got there!!   Ha ha ha.  Oh, the stories we can tell!!  . . . and the fun we have along the way!<br>
<br>
Poison oak is our latest adventure that makes us stop and ask ourselves, "Is this really smart?"  <br>
Wood-aug placed a box right in poison oak.  I went to find it and didn't notice the PO until I was eye-to-leaf while replacing the box!  Well, because of my health situation it became a pretty worrisome issue a week later while boxing in the Trout Lake area.  Our adventure included midnight runs to the Hood River Safeway for remedies, calls to San Francisco to reach the doc-on-call while trying to find cell service on a phone with a dying battery and way too much angst .  Thank God the PO didn't go systemic or do anything serious.  My doc is telling me to avoid the woods.  Oh man, that's like telling a fish to avoid the water!!     Luckily W-a isn't allergic to PO so he wasn't effected.  <br>
<br>
So the moral of the story is . . . when searching for boxes, keep your head about you!  MAN, IS THAT HARD TO DO WHEN YOU'RE looking for your next rubber fix!!  . . . oh what these wonderful treasures put us through!<br>
<br>
Yup, letterboxing brings adventure to life!<br>

Then there's Ryan's Angel's Rest box... When I go up there with someone looking for the it, I <br>
take clippers with me. I'm in the advance guard, clearing the path, gingerly avoiding <br>
