<br/>
It is with great sadness that I inform you that reports of Van Duzer<br/>
Corridor and Devil's Punchbowl Letterboxes missing are true.  We checked<br/>
both out on Friday afternoon and they are gone, gone, gone.  <br/>
<br/>
It really breaks my heart, especially Devil's Punchbowl, because I think<br/>
it is my very favorite of letterboxes that I've ever placed.  I had so<br/>
much fun carving the stamp.  Now he's probably back in hell and won't be<br/>
bothering anyone with his cup of brew any more.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues will be removed from the main site when I can get to a real<br/>
computer.  Hopefully sometime next week.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

followed the clues right. There was a nice little letterbox hole at the front of this <br/>
big knarly tree that  we thought was probably the hiding place. You aren't <br/>
going to replace them in a different place? We think you should consider <br/>
keeping the locations and just changing the hiding spot and clues. <br/>
