Well there is less than one week until the gathering in Liberty Lake.<br/>
So excited to meet you all. Remember that there are no reservations in<br/>
the Liberty Lkae campground, so the earlier you get there the better,<br/>
those that have sent a deposit I will be saving a site for. Just a<br/>
couple of things. There are about 14 planted out there right now and 2<br/>
more on their way out there. This event will have a lot of kids there<br/>
so I would appricate it if we could keep it alcohol fee please. The<br/>
hike is beautiful and the weekend is going to be a lot of fun. Looking<br/>
forward to seeing you all next weekend.<br/>
