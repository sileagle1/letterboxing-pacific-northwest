From: <br>
<br>
YOUR AGE BY CHOCOLATE MATH<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is pretty neat.<br>
<br>
DON'T CHEAT BY SCROLLING DOWN FIRST!<br>
It takes less than a minute.<br>
Work this out as you read ...<br>
Be sure you don't read the bottom until you've worked it out!<br>
This is not one of those waste of time things, it's fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. First of all, pick the number of times a week that you would like <br>
to have chocolate <br>
(more than once but less than 10)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Multiply this number by 2 (just to be bold)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Add 5<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Multiply it by 50 -- I'll wait while you get the calculator <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. If you have already had your birthday this year add 1756 ....<br>
If you haven't, add 1755.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. Now subtract the four digit year that you were born.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You should have a three digit number <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The first digit of this was your original number<br>
(i.e., how many times you want to have chocolate each week).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The next two numbers are <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
YOUR AGE! (Oh YES, it is!!!!!)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THIS IS THE ONLY YEAR (2006) IT WILL EVER WORK, SO SPREAD IT AROUND <br>
WHILE IT LASTS.<br>
