                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last weekend was a springlike mixture in Central Oregon: drizzle, snow, grey skies and blazing sun. The desert <br/>
wildflowers are just beginning; Yellow Bells and Sand Lilies abound. On Sunday, it was perfect weather for going <br/>
over Misery Ridge at Smith Rock State Park, still hard work but no killer heat to make it really unpleasant. All <br/>
this is encouragement to get thee over the big hill and letterboxing in Central Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
I checked on four of my boxes while I was there: Crooked River Ranch #1, #2 and #4 as well as the Mariposa <br/>
Lily box at Smith Rock. All are alive and have been visited at least once but are positively begging for <br/>
attention. It seem that one of these boxes it mighty popular with geocachers but their signatures are not <br/>
nearly as exciting as a rubber stamp. Please don't make me grovel.... Funhog<br/>

Okay, Okay, I'm calling my rock-climbing sister and begging her to <br/>
come out here so we can go to Smith Rock!! <br/>
She can climb and I can letterbox :-)<br/>
