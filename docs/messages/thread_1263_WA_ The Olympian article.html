There's also a blurb about it in the latest Hands On Children's <br>
Museum newsletter.<br>
<br>
I foresee a new 'exponential expansion' in the hobby around here.<br>

It was an okay article and I truly hope it doesn't open the boxes up <br>
to teenage monkeyshines!<br>
<br>
Hmm...I truly hope that was a staged photo of the letterbox in it's <br>
hiding spot!<br>
<br>
Been real busy with family stuff lately and haven't had a chance to <br>
letterbox in weeks. Hmm...gotta catch up on yard work or letterbox <br>
this afternoon...which will win....tune in next time..<br>
<br>
Til later,<br>

<br>
Nope, that honor should go to our other boxious buddies in the area <br>
(Funhog, Amanda from Seattle, Paisley Orca, etc).  You can just call <br>
me the Queen of Chaos (or paint stripping, fence mending, <br>
electrician, floor sanding/staining/buffing, etc...) at the <br>
moment!!!  ;)  That would better explain why I've exchanged the ink <br>
covered fingers for the stain/paint stripper spattered arms these <br>
days!<br>
<br>
I think the article will generate some new enthusiasm for <br>
letterboxing in the area. It'll be neat to have some more boxes to <br>
look for (instead of just having to focus on maintaining/replacing <br>
the ones that keep disappearing)!  There are quite a few little <br>
cubby holes of parks/secret spots around these parts (especially SW <br>
Sound) that are just begging for boxes.  I've already noticed an <br>
increase in the number of hits to the various clue pages around here <br>
since yesterday & have received some questions from folks who want <br>
to set up some letterboxing events for the Girl Scouts in the area <br>
this next season.<br>
<br>
It's exciting to see the new activity in the area!  Hopefully, we'll <br>
be able to get back out there boxing in the near future.  Until <br>
then, life calls...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good point there dvn2ckr.  We ourselves haven't been to busy in the physical<br>
aspect of letterboxing recently, more so with the intangible side of it at<br>
the website, making some major changes to the interface to the database and<br>
ll.<br>
<br>
I feel that articles such as this are a mixed blessing. On one hand we'll<br>
get more people who will try it because it's new.  Some of those will<br>
undoubtedly try a few times and grow tired of it, some with run for a few<br>
weeks, and then start to slip away as other things in their lives clamor for<br>
attentions and some will become very, very enthusiastic about it! (grin)<br>
We'll end up with some people that do things out of pure meanness which<br>
means we'll end up with a few boxes damaged or destroyed, but, to me, that<br>
means just recreate and rehide.<br>
<br>
We've been, on our end here, other than working on the next 3 sets we're<br>
putting out.  The Curse of the Black Pearl starts next weekend, Ghosts of<br>
Washington will follow that and  A Secret Society Do Exist!  (Quote from a<br>
song on a movie).<br>
<br>
We've started putting together supplies to donate to the Scouting<br>
organizations, so, if you know of any in the area that are interested in<br>
Letterboxing, have them get in touch with me.<br>
<br>
Other than that, we're looking forward to another gather here in the near<br>
future in the PNW, any takers on coordinating one?  We were originally<br>
planning on Boxaplooza to coincide with Earthday, but since that's not<br>
happening and I don't know of anyone else planning on an event this month,<br>
mayhap someone can pull one together?  The weathers turning wonderful for<br>
it.<br>
