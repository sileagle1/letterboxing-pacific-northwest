Well we went out for a quick trip to nab some of Pupp's boxes in the Dog<br>
park last week here in Vancouver.  My oldest daughter, Daisy, just loves<br>
bugs, NOT.  She lifted the mossy covered rock but to her eyes did behold a<br>
black snake all coiled around the box.  As she proceeded to jump back about<br>
10 feet away from the box, came mom to the rescue.  Now I am not fond of<br>
those critters either, but I grabbed a stick and prodded the little feller.<br>
It did not move so I assumed that it was dead.  I got it carefully under the<br>
box and nabbed the box out just in case it was alive.  As we thought we were<br>
out just for a bit I had on my sturdy sandals but my girls had on those<br>
lovely flip flops.  So needless to say if that snake came toward any of us<br>
the whole town would have seen and heard us running away.  Daisy then<br>
proclaimed that she was not coming near us to stamp in.  I told her that she<br>
had to or would not get the stamp, I am so mean.  I kept looking into the<br>
hole to make sure that the snake was still there as we stamped in.  It was,<br>
for the most part of the procedure.  Then low and behold it was gone.  Here<br>
we go again.  I kept hearing the song "I don't like spiders and snakes"<br>
going over and over in my head.  So here goes Daisy again in the 10 foot<br>
range of the rock. So be forewarned about this box in the open field where<br>
all can see.  Willow, Daisey and Heartsey.  <br>
