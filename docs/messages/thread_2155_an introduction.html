I'm new to the list so I thought I'd introduce myself.  My family and<br>
I just started letterboxing a couple of weeks ago and we're having a<br>
lot of fun with it.  I'm getting lots of exercise too, which is a good<br>
thing!  I have 4 children, ages 14, 11, 6, and 21 months.  Our trail<br>
name is Millers6 of Puyallup.<br>
<br>
We placed our 2nd box today.  Both of the boxes we placed are at<br>
Bradley Lake Park in Puyallup. (clues available at letterboxing.org).<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to getting to know y'all!<br>

My family and I discovered this wonderful hobby just a little over 2 years<br>
ago and we've been almost 'overly' enthusiastic about it!  (grin) <br>
Everyone gets something different from this hobby and I hope that you<br>
enjoy it as much as my family does!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing you on the trails as we (At least the family<br>
still is) located in Tacoma (Parkland).<br>

In any case, I did go and find both of your boxes Wednesday, and they're very cute stamps!  Good hiding spots, too!  The second seemed a little uncovered, so I made sure to hide it a little better than I found it, but the first had a really neat home.  My mother and I were first finders for the second box, but third or so for the first box.<br>
 <br>
Thanks for the fun!<br>

Ah, thanks!  My husband hid that one, and I was just thinking<br>
yesterday that maybe I should revisit it and make sure it's tucked<br>
away a little better.<br>
