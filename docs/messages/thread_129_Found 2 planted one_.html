                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, everyone, I went on an excursion today at the Washington Park <br/>
Zoo in Portland Oregon.  Found the 2 remaining boxes of 5 originally <br/>
set.  The second one was behind a log and between a fern and the most <br/>
disgusting fungus stuff I have ever encountered, lol, stuck my hand <br/>
right in it.  akkkkkkkkkk!  but it was a lot of fun.  the zoo was <br/>
crammed as it was Earth day today.  But I think I was successful in <br/>
remaining descreet.  The stamps were lovely!<br/>
<br/>
Also, we made it up to the Hoyt Aboretum and planted my tribute box <br/>
there.  Found an awesome place for it, hope it stays hidden and gets <br/>
lots of visitors, gotta write the clues and publish them now......  <br/>
besides the gradual climb, it's an easy find I think.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are all having a lovely day where ever you are!  <br/>
<br/>
Oh ya, and I sat on the end stump the log fell from and got pitch ALL <br/>
over my rear, went thru my jeans and onto my skin, so I had sticky <br/>
buns all the way back.  lol.  Anyone have a good remedy for removing <br/>
this goo?  Wingnut<br/>
