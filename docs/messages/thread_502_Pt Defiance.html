Dannie and I had a great time at Pt Defiance today!  Thanks again to <br/>
Bookworm and Sleeping Whippet and SeeShore for helping us find that elusive <br/>
Fantasy... *smiles*  We enjoyed getting to know some fellow hunters and <br/>
swapping stamps.... The event stamps were glorious, thanks again Sleeping <br/>
Whippet and Dvn2rckr, you guys are amazing!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all on the trail later, Jessi<br/>

&gt;We were able, at the last minute, to make it to the Gathering at Pt.<br/>
&gt;Defiance today and what a wonderful time we had. It was so good to see our<br/>
&gt;friends again and to be able to make new ones as well.  We took pictures,<br/>
&gt;and they will be available in the Gallery section within a few days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;MiniBullyMom and dvn2ckr, I want to thank you for coordinating and planning<br/>
&gt;this one, it was wonderful!  You guys are the greatest!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And no, somehow things managed to lumber along without you there Ryan. <br/>
&gt;Can't<br/>
&gt;imagine why though!  (chuckles)<br/>
