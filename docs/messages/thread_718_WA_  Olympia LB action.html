We would have crossed paths there dvn2rckr!  RayvenMom and I were planning<br/>
on getting an early start and grab those boxes but we both woke up a bit<br/>
under the weather and decided to make it a lump day.. You know, a lump day<br/>
on the couch or the bed, just relaxing and resting.<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna try and get out there tomorrow.<br/>

&gt; After several days confined to staring into a computer screen, we<br/>
&gt; finally got an opportunity to head out and get some fresh air (after<br/>
&gt; my '6 mile run round DuPont sans kids' belated birthday gift TRKEE<br/>
&gt; gave me this morning).  We sort of incorporated our family<br/>
&gt; letterboxing outing into a slightly belated birthday party for one<br/>
&gt; very 'cooped-up' dvn2r ckr!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We attempted the 7Nails' Father's Day series in Lacey and were 2 for<br/>
&gt; 4.  Such a thoughtful gift from sons to their father!  We'll have to<br/>
&gt; remember that when rnrB &amp; trkr get a bit older!  Hopefully, #1 &amp; #3<br/>
&gt; reappear someday.  We'd love to see the images.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Found Hedwig's Journal in Olympia alive &amp; well.  What great clues<br/>
&gt; and a neat peak into a world in which we hadn't yet delved--who knew<br/>
&gt; there was so much public art in that area?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Took a trip to the moon &amp; back with ArtspeakNW's Capitol Moon Tree<br/>
&gt; LB Series.  We weren't that successful landing back onto Earth<br/>
&gt; (especially since cops were EVERYWHERE it seemed) but we enjoyed the<br/>
&gt; series nonetheless!  We learned things about the region that we<br/>
&gt; hadn't previously known.  What a neat trip through an area that we<br/>
&gt; often frequent but up til now often ignorantly kept our eyes<br/>
&gt; closed...thanks for the 'enlightenment'.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks, folks, for several great new letterboxes in the region.<br/>
&gt; Some even placed by new letterboxers in the region--how exciting!!!<br/>
&gt; We're looking forward to finding future letterboxes of yours in the<br/>
&gt; area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All in all, a great &amp; refreshing opportunity to get out of the house<br/>
&gt; for a bit and to celebrate a birthday--that seems to come around<br/>
&gt; quicker and quicker each year...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; See you on the trail, just don't know when our next 'jail-break'<br/>
&gt; letterboxing opportunity will occur...  :(<br/>

Yes, we are in the process of moving, should have been in the new house this<br/>
weekend, but we're in limbo, awaiting the loan approval. Things have been<br/>
getting more and more hectic.  I've been sitting here at the computer,<br/>
coding the new PNWLb website, adding in a Chat system, an Event calendar,<br/>
the Database, Moonphases, Threat levels, weather, Journals (Speaking of<br/>
which, I hope that you were typing in German and not that my system got<br/>
everything screwed up when you made your journal entry.), Forums and<br/>
anything I can think of that could help letterboxers in the Pacific<br/>
Northwest.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to head out together, we'd love to accompany your guys and make<br/>
a team effort with you both.<br/>

&gt; Too bad, a team effort might have led to better results--some of us<br/>
&gt; could have distracted the cops while the others 'poked and<br/>
&gt; prodded'.  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry you both were not feeling well.  Hope you're back up and about<br/>
&gt; soon--out of that 'lump' stage.  ;)  Hey, aren't you guys in the<br/>
&gt; process of moving?  That's enough stress in itself!<br/>
