We would have crossed paths there dvn2rckr!  RayvenMom and I were planning<br>
on getting an early start and grab those boxes but we both woke up a bit<br>
under the weather and decided to make it a lump day.. You know, a lump day<br>
on the couch or the bed, just relaxing and resting.<br>
<br>
We're gonna try and get out there tomorrow.<br>

Yes, we are in the process of moving, should have been in the new house this<br>
weekend, but we're in limbo, awaiting the loan approval. Things have been<br>
getting more and more hectic.  I've been sitting here at the computer,<br>
coding the new PNWLb website, adding in a Chat system, an Event calendar,<br>
the Database, Moonphases, Threat levels, weather, Journals (Speaking of<br>
which, I hope that you were typing in German and not that my system got<br>
everything screwed up when you made your journal entry.), Forums and<br>
anything I can think of that could help letterboxers in the Pacific<br>
Northwest.<br>
<br>
If you want to head out together, we'd love to accompany your guys and make<br>
a team effort with you both.<br>
