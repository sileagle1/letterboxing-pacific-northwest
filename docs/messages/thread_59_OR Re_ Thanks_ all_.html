We had no problem with the Birdwatcher box.   Persistance I think is the key.<br>
Has anyone found all 6 for Murder in Gabriel Park?  We're stuck - found 4.<br>

<br>
*raised hand*  I have! I have!!!  =)  I also know that Funhog and <br>
certain members of the Traveling Circus have them all, Amanda from <br>
Seattle, and Mark & Beth.  Speaking of which, where are they?  I <br>
haven't seen or heard a peep from them on the talk lists in I don't <br>
know how long!<br>
<br>
But I can also list all sorts of people that haven't been able to <br>
find them all.  *shrug*  And the worst part is, boxes of the series <br>
COULD be missing, but given the nature of the clue, it's impossible <br>
to verify it without telling you exactly where all the boxes are.  <br>
=)  I replaced two that were missing back in September, I think it <br>
was, but haven't gotten any reports about anyone finding them since <br>
then.<br>
