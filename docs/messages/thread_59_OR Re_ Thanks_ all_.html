We had no problem with the Birdwatcher box.   Persistance I think is the key.<br/>
Has anyone found all 6 for Murder in Gabriel Park?  We're stuck - found 4.<br/>

&gt; Actually we did find it just with the directionals!  It took a bit <br/>
of forensics to decide that the "fall" was recent..... color of <br/>
roots, growth under the log, etc.  Just enough to lead us to the <br/>
box.....  We have all the Tryon Creek but the Orphan - and we just <br/>
haven't had enough daylight in the evenings to get to it.  <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Hey Wild Woman, when you were at Tryon Creek, had the landscape <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes!!!  That "leaning" tree in the clues for #3 Red Fox has <br/>
fallen!  I'd <br/>
&gt; learned this from the LbNA archives before we set out (someone had <br/>
already <br/>
&gt; reported it--I'm sorry now that I didn't think to repeat that info <br/>
in my <br/>
&gt; "alive &amp; well" e-mail)--but even knowing that, Heather &amp; I spend a <br/>
good long <br/>
&gt; while in search of that box--the trickiest of the lot in Tryon, <br/>
I'd say.  <br/>
&gt; Have another run at the darned thing--I'm sure it's still there, <br/>
since we <br/>
&gt; found it so recently.  (If you have other boxes yet to find there, <br/>
you might <br/>
&gt; write in their  logbooks that #3's leaning tree has fallen, to <br/>
help those who <br/>
&gt; follow.)<br/>

<br/>
*raised hand*  I have! I have!!!  =)  I also know that Funhog and <br/>
certain members of the Traveling Circus have them all, Amanda from <br/>
Seattle, and Mark &amp; Beth.  Speaking of which, where are they?  I <br/>
haven't seen or heard a peep from them on the talk lists in I don't <br/>
know how long!<br/>
<br/>
But I can also list all sorts of people that haven't been able to <br/>
find them all.  *shrug*  And the worst part is, boxes of the series <br/>
COULD be missing, but given the nature of the clue, it's impossible <br/>
to verify it without telling you exactly where all the boxes are.  <br/>
=)  I replaced two that were missing back in September, I think it <br/>
was, but haven't gotten any reports about anyone finding them since <br/>
then.<br/>
