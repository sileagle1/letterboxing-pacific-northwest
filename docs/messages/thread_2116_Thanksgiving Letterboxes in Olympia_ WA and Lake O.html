<br/>
The good news.  After being alerted by Wild Rose that the 1st Annual <br/>
Thanksgiving Letterbox in Olympia, WA was soaked and needed attention, <br/>
we have completely revamped it.  New box, new bags, new logbook, and <br/>
most importantly a new stamp!  Now all of you who have found this box <br/>
already will have an excuse to go visit it again.  The only thing that <br/>
isn't new is the location.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news.  The 2nd Annual Thanksgiving Letterbox in Lake Oswego, OR <br/>
is missing.  We intend to replace it, but don't know yet when that will <br/>
happen.  We have updated the LbNA website with the current status, and <br/>
will send another message out when it is back in business.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you soooo much for updating the website(s) with the status of your<br/>
boxes!  We've had pretty bad luck finding boxes the last few trips and can't<br/>
tell if we're in the wrong spot or if the boxes have taken leave.<br/>
<br/>
For example, we've been skunked the last 2 (or 3?) times out to BG Lake to<br/>
find those remaining boxes (like FIVE of them!).  On the way home I swear<br/>
I'm going to give up on them but then later we're back.  Guess it's a good<br/>
gesture to support the WA state parks anyway!<br/>
