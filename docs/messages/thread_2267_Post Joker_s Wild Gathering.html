                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you all for your kind words regarding the Joker's Wild <br>
Letterboxing Poker Run Gathering last week.  I had such a good time <br>
meeting everyone and chatting.  I hope to meet up with you all again <br>
sometime soon.<br>
<br>
I have a little after-gathering business to take care of here.  A <br>
nice Totes umbrella (black) ended up in my car.  Not sure who it <br>
belongs to, but I'd be happy to return it to you if you'll drop me <br>
an email.<br>
<br>
To all you intrepid boxers that braved the thunderstorm after the <br>
gathering...whoo hoo!  That was a blast.  My log book will never be <br>
the same again, but it will be a good story in the scrapbook!<br>
<br>
If anyone took pictures of the event and would like to share them, <br>
I'd love to see them!  I'm going to put a bunch more pictures in the <br>
event book, and Maiden only posted FOUR on atlasquest.<br>
<br>
And finally, if any of you ended up with any of the Poker Run boxes, <br>
could you let me know?  We are trying to keep the set together in <br>
case we want to do this again someday.  I know we pulled 4 or 5 <br>
before the thunderstorm, but we all got seperated in the race for <br>
the cars.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much to all of you who came and said such nice things <br>
about our party!<br>
