was a good one.  Yesterday I went in search of and found Eliza B's <br/>
Ravenna box.  FYI, I think the picnic table mentioned as "being on <br/>
the right" in the clearing has been removed or moved.  The only <br/>
picnic table was off on the lefthand side, not viewable from where <br/>
you emerge in the clearning.  Just ignore that part of the clue and <br/>
follow the trail straight through the clearning, and you should be <br/>
fine.  Thanks for another fabulous stamp!  And what a great place for <br/>
a study break...   <br/>
