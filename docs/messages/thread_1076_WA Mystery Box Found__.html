                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yup..I solved the Cpt. Chambers clues! It is actually a very easy box <br>
to find if you know your local history/lore. If not it really gives <br>
you enough clues to get an idea where it could be located. <br>
<br>
IT is doing fine ... a little lonely. We were the fifth people to <br>
find it. Two letterboxers have found it and two geocachers have <br>
stumbled upon it. The second geocacher actually had a stamp he <br>
stamped in the logbook! So me and my son got fifth and sixth find if <br>
you count everyone who has found it. No one has been to in for a few <br>
months! I think it was in Sept that the geocachers found it.<br>
