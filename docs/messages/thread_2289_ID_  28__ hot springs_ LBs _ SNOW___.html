<br>
It's been a LONG while since we posted a letterboxing update on this <br>
board.  Went out yesterday in search of hot springs around Idaho. We <br>
headed North out of Boise on our way toward Molly's Tubs Hot Springs <br>
in the Boise National Forest. Along the way, we're greeted with snow. <br>
LOTS OF SNOW! Everywhere we look! We continue on, assuming that since <br>
we're heading toward hot springs the water will still be warm & <br>
inviting.<br>
<br>
We follow the road heading north, north, north. We see some <br>
incredible sights along the way. Rolling hills, snow capped cascades, <br>
rushing rivers, you name it, it's absolutely gorgeous!<br>
<br>
We continue along the Payette River. Eventually we reach the North <br>
Fork of the Payette River. We work our way through the forest roads <br>
in the mountains toward the turn off for Molly's Tubs. The gate's <br>
locked and there's about a foot and a half of snow on the ground. <br>
Small problem. We're dressed for hot springs (swim suits & all), not <br>
snow-shoeing. ;)  Thank goodness for our ever present Gore Tex coats!<br>
<br>
We decide to change plans and continue further north to Warm Lake. <br>
Sounds inviting, doesn't it? Well, we eventually reach it and it's <br>
gorgeous! Snow all around yet it's still reachable. We seek out <br>
letterboxes along the way. Exquisite!<br>
<br>
We continue our afternoon in search of beautiful vistas and the <br>
occasional letterbox. We find Summer Sensation, Roughin' It, Busy <br>
Bee, and Cascade Critters #1&2. Sort of ironic that all of these <br>
letterboxes are based on 'summer' themes, isn't it? We find them all <br>
in at least a foot of snow! At least our 'summer November outing' <br>
will keep us cool.<br>
<br>
Our final LB series for the day takes us to Crown Point. We follow an <br>
old railroad grade for about 3 miles (yes, the hike is only supposed <br>
to be 2 miles TOTAL!) and find 2 incredible stamps along the way. <br>
Toward the end of our hike, the snow & winds pick up and we're soon <br>
racing to beat the storm so we can cross the bridge & dams along the <br>
way on our return trip to Ada County. What an incredible day! Went <br>
looking for hot springs, came home with 5 incredible letterbox finds, <br>
several fun hours spent playing in the snow & great memories for a <br>
lifetime. That's what letterboxing is all about, isn't it? <br>
