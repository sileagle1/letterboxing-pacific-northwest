                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had an accidental litter of 9 bunnies and we need to give them  <br/>
away or find more cages to seperate them before they multiply again.<br/>
<br/>
They and their older siblings (we already had 7) are very docile and  <br/>
sweet. We are looking for loving homes and don't want them to be hurt/ <br/>
eaten! They are about 8 wks and ready to be separate from Momma so if  <br/>
you want a bunny for a pet or 4H please email me!<br/>
We have gray, black and tan. A couple have white paws or nose.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you have a spare cage you would part with for cheap please  <br/>
contact me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
