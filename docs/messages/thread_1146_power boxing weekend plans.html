able to join us for any of these planned trips is more than welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Maiden is picking me up from the hotel about 2pm on Friday and we're <br/>
planning on a trip to Washington Park and the Forestry Center for <br/>
some boxing!! Afterwards, thanks to Willow's planning, we'll be going <br/>
for have dinner at the Spaghetti Factory. Even if you're not able to <br/>
make the boxing trip, you're welcome to join us and exchange stamps <br/>
over dinner. Just let Willow know so adjustments can be made with the <br/>
reservation numbers.<br/>
<br/>
MiniBullyMom and MomNOtime, I'll plan on you being at the Airport <br/>
Embassy sometime around 7am-ish on Saturday morning.  Yes, there is a <br/>
breakfast buffet available for a quick bite since you're planning <br/>
such an early morning departure from Washington.<br/>
<br/>
After the Mom's and I do a quick power-boxing session we'll meet up <br/>
at the IHOP (I hope MiniBullyMom knows where that is, because I'm not <br/>
going to be any help! LOL) at about 10am. After we get a nibble we're <br/>
all going back out for more boxing for a couple of more hours.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay...it's a plan...we will meet you at the hotel bright and early <br/>
around 7am. I have the list of boxes recommended by Melanie and we <br/>
three will meet at the IHOP with everyone else around 9-10ish. <br/>
MomNoTime and I will be able to hang around and box with everyone <br/>
until noonish when we have to head back north.<br/>
<br/>
I will need to know which IHOP we are meeting at so we can Mapquest <br/>
it though. I seem to remember seeing an IHOP near the Embassy Suites <br/>
but I'm not totally sure though..it was about midnight when I was <br/>
lost in that area!! LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm so excited and really wish we could stay all day and box...but my <br/>
family would disown me (and my niece heartbroken) if I missed her <br/>
baptism. <br/>
<br/>
Til later,<br/>
