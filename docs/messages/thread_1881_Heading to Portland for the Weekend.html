<br/>
My wife and I are taking the train from Seattle to Portland for a 3 day<br/>
weekend. We will be staying in the Pearl District of Portland.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have suggestions for any letterboxes near there? We will be on<br/>
foot and using the local public transportation.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br/>

If you want to do do some hiking (easy hiking, but still hiking!), I'd<br/>
recommend looking for boxes in Washington Park and hiking out as far<br/>
as Pittock Mansion.  There are several boxes you can find along the<br/>
way, though it's been quite a while since I've boxed in that area and<br/>
can't really give you a full list of all the boxes you'd pass.  Others<br/>
might be able to do so, however.  Take the MAX to the zoo stop.  (In<br/>
fact, there's even at least one letterbox that, last I heard, is still<br/>
at the zoo!)<br/>
<br/>
For even easier hiking, there are some boxes at the Tualitin Hills<br/>
Nature Park, though some of the trails often seem to be closed down in<br/>
the winter.  I'm not sure if that's the case at the moment.  The stop<br/>
at Elmonica (I *think*--I'm running this off at the top of my head and<br/>
like I said, it's been awhile since I've been out here so my memory is<br/>
rusty) on the MAX will drop you off right at the park.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

In fact, I think there are four boxes in the Zoo that <br/>
are alive an well. Near the Zoo look for CT/OR <br/>

Macleay Park there are tons of boxes. The Wonderful <br/>
Tour starts near the Zoo and has know to frustrate <br/>
many a letterboxer. Get a map of the Trails of Forest <br/>

It's a shame that all the Urban boxes are missing. esp, Powell's <br/>
Books, and Sigfreid and Roy's Baby....Although I think Ryan's <br/>
Portland Walking Tour is still alive and well, but it takes all day <br/>
to decipher the clues! (he is evil like that)<br/>

&gt; Although I think Ryan's Portland Walking Tour is still alive and well<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, it has been reported as missing, and I believe it.  Next time I<br/>
visit, I plan to find a new hiding place for it.  =(  (Not too far<br/>
away from the original location, but definitely a new location is needed.)<br/>
<br/>
However, there is the Turtle Soup box in downtown Portland that I'm<br/>
itching to get my hands on, and that one is unlikely to go missing<br/>
anytime soon.  =)<br/>
