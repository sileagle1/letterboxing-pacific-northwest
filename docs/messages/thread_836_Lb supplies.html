name ever?) for great letterbox boxes. They have a knockoff of the<br>
better Rubbermaid containers, the ones with the blue rubber seal, for<br>
less than fifty cents each! Plus Michael's has all the Strathmore<br>
products, including the small sketch pads on sale for 50% off<br>
10/19-25. Ink pads are 20% off. I went Hog Wild yesterday stocking up<br>
and I spent less than ten bucks. Funhog<br>
