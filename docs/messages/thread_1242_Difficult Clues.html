penney?):<br>
<br>
Don't be discouraged by the negative feed back on your clues.  I've <br>
looked at several of them, and I look forward to attempting them <br>
next time I head north.  Many of us actually prefer the difficult <br>
cules.  Ryan, Funhog, and all the rest out there who take great care <br>
in developing difficult clues, WE SALUTE YOU!<br>
<br>
Drive by's are nice to increase your F-count, and I've picked up <br>
several of them myself, but it's the ones that take a lot of thought <br>
that I'm proud to have in my log book.<br>
<br>
That's all for now.<br>

P.S. Try "Range Rover" in Albany County, Wyoming.  I haven't got it <br>
yet, but I want to next time I'm back home!<br>
