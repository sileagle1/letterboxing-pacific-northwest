suffering many setbacks, is now back up and running with the addition <br/>
of a 4th box!<br/>
<br/>
I recently had a week in WA and getting my boxes was a high priority so <br/>
everything has been glued, rehid, rewritten, replaced, recarved, etc <br/>
etc... phew!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all those that hunted and reported what needed to be done and <br/>
hopefully box #4, JeLo See, will be worth another trip up/down here (It <br/>
really is my favorite thus far :)!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
