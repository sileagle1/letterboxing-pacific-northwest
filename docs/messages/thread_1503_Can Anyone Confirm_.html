I can verify that the Book Keep Series is missing - I have found it and went<br/>
back to check on it last month when Funhog had her class in Longview -- also<br/>
confirmed missing in Long View are Rambling Rose and Noah's Arch.<br/>
<br/>
Wow a hitch hiker at Andy Gump! That's what I get getting it first!<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations and looking forward to meeting you at Stamp Camp<br/>
