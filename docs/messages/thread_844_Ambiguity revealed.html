Allow me to introduce my ambiguous-self, I know that many of you have <br/>
heard of me, if not all of you. Some of you may still believe me to <br/>
be an apparition of pandora's creative and astounding imagination. <br/>
Nonetheless I am here to set the record of that ambiguous tale <br/>
straight. I am for real, I do exist, and yes love it or hate it, <br/>
pandora and I are a pair.  Some say made in heaven and others say <br/>
made in hell but you will have to decide that for yourself.  <br/>
Furthermore my name is Iron`Bear for those of you who are not aware <br/>
of that trivial fact yet. <br/>
<br/>
I have been compelled for sometime now to acquiesce myself to the <br/>
letterboxing group, and felt that now would be as good of a time as <br/>
any to become more involved vocally on the boards. I have been <br/>
involved in letterboxing with pandora for some time now, and it has <br/>
truly been a liberating experience when I have been able to take her <br/>
letterboxing in the Portland area. She tells me every detail in <br/>
regards to the conversations that occur on the boards, and I must say <br/>
that I am looking forward to getting to know many of you much better <br/>
in the projected future. A fair warning beforehand I do tend to <br/>
remain silent overall, and will more than likely say very little, but <br/>
I do read the vast majority of what comes across the board. However <br/>
when I am so inclined to comment it usually can be consider a <br/>
diatribe, but usually with a point, at least that is what it is an <br/>
attempt at anyways. <br/>
<br/>
With all of that said I bid you all well. <br/>
<br/>

Dont worry about being the silent partner, but do speak up when you <br/>
will if this is an example of your writing and thoughts!!!<br/>

<br/>
Just wanted to drop a litte note to let you know that I too look <br/>
forward to seeing you again.  I really enjoyed sitting next to you at <br/>
the last gathering. You are a wealth of letterboxing information!<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would hint at you too that you already met Iron`Bear <br/>
=) ... He's probably stamped into your book as well.  He was the <br/>
large bodygaurd looking type with me at the last event that I kept <br/>
calling over to sign books after I stamped us into them =P<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait -- I should not have said that.... lots of people still think <br/>
Iron`Bear is a figment of my imagination.... ohhh fiddle faddle, I <br/>
could not imagine a guy that great if I tried! <winks><br/>
<br/>
I agree with your sentiment though, he writes wonderful posts and I <br/>
do hope to see alot more from him....<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you Saturday,<br/>
