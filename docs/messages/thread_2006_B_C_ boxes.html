If you're ever in the Fraser Valley area on a quest for letterboxes, <br/>
(what other quest would you be on?) check out the "Westminster Abbey <br/>
Series" in Mission. Placed by Zara, these boxes are definitely worth <br/>
the trip. Follow the advice in the clues, and visit the area on Sunday <br/>
between 4:00 and 4:30. It's at this time that the Tower Bells are <br/>
rung; and when you hear them while walking through the woods, it's <br/>
almost as though you've gone back in time.<br/>
<br/>
But watch out for the wildlife. While investigating a particularly <br/>
promising hiding spot, I had a squirrel dart out at me. I had no idea <br/>
these little creatures could be so frightening!<br/>

It's a quick jaunt... maybe 45 minutes, (including stamping time). It <br/>
took me longer because I went in to see the chapel, or at least what <br/>
they call the "chapel". It's very large with lots of stained glass and <br/>
carvings. It's also very, very quiet, cool and subdued. It's very <br/>
spiritual. I'm not Catholic, but even I felt compelled to confess!<br/>

Is this the same place where the Sunworshipper box can be found?  I <br/>
wanted to see that mission building without all the boards on the <br/>

 No, but this series is only about 10 minutes up the road, so both could easily be done in one day. :)<br/>
