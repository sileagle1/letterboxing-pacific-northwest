This was an awesome little trek! We had a blast. Found #1 right off the bat but almost missed #2, and then, on the way to #3, we stumbled across #2!!!!!  Located #4 with out a hitch, it was a wonderful hick up the trail, then couldn't find #5 to save our lives, it appears theres been much damages to the trees there, and even though we are sure we found the right burned stump 68 paces down the trial, we found not located a box anywhere in or around or under anything with an hour of searching.<br/>
<br/>
All in all though, we had a BLAST!!!!<br/>
