                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,<br>
I'm back from camping up on Mt. Hood and am full of enthusiasm,<br>
especially since y'all have stepped forward to adopt some of Der Mad<br>
Stamper's boxes.<br>
<br>
Thanks go to:<br>
<br>
Pandora (for helping out on all things 'Letterbox')<br>
Brett (for offering to adopt Lost)<br>
Funhog (for adopting Bronson Creek)<br>
and Green Hornet (for the original placement of Rock Creek #1 and #2<br>
and for agreeing to help out with the other Rock Creek boxes)<br>
<br>
BTW: Green Hornet mentioned that the Troll box might not be on THPRD<br>
property and he is correct.  Also, I'm only monitoring those boxes on<br>
THPRD lands, so this one and any others NOT on district lands will be<br>
out of my purview.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I'll add my own 2 cents about local letterboxing history (re:<br>
Pandora, 7/21).  I agree wholeheartedly that such an icon's boxes<br>
should be maintained as symbols of the local fun.  I won't wax<br>
patriotic or any such drivelly thing, but I like the idea of keeping<br>
DMS's name alive, and I'm sure he'd appreciate it too.<br>

<br>
I was just wanting to let people know that I have stepped up to <br>
adopt the Lost Letterbox. I e-mailed Kyle when he sent out the <br>
request for help with DMS's boxes and he was kind enough to pass on <br>
the responsibility. I think it's great that we are all to keep these <br>
boxes going.<br>
