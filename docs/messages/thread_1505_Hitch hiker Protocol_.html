I see an email address of the starter....I emailed that person to tell<br>
them the status and where it was found.<br>
Now, do I stamp MY stamp in there? or the stamp of the place I found<br>
the box? or the place that I drop the box???<br>
Is the goal to keep the box moving? or to get it as far away from our<br>
area as possible? or back to the owner?<br>

Any and all advice is appreciated.<br>

I figured that to be the case...but wanted to be sure.<br>
I've also come to understand that hitch hiker starters<br>
understand that they may never see their hitch hiker<br>
again...it's merely the thrill of someone emailing and<br>
saying they have it so that you know it's still alive.<br>
<br>
This gets more fun every day!<br>

thinking about placing it at a letterbox that doesn't<br>
get as much traffic in hopes that someone who is a<br>
real go getter would take it to a far away place. LOL<br>
