I see an email address of the starter....I emailed that person to tell<br/>

I figured that to be the case...but wanted to be sure.<br/>
I've also come to understand that hitch hiker starters<br/>
understand that they may never see their hitch hiker<br/>
again...it's merely the thrill of someone emailing and<br/>
saying they have it so that you know it's still alive.<br/>
<br/>
This gets more fun every day!<br/>
