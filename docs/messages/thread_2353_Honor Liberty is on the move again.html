Cemetery this evening, the most appropriate place I could think of. <br/>
The hitchhiker is out there to remind us of 9-11 and how much liberty<br/>
means to us all.  I know of two letterboxes up there, and I left her<br/>
with one of them.  The clues for both are posted at LBNA's site.  If<br/>
you aren't familiar with this hitchhiker, they ask that one post the<br/>
location, as the goal is for as many people to make her acquaintance<br/>
as possible.  <br/>
