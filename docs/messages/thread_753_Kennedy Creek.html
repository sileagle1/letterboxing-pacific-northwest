Visited all the boxes, all are well and in good shape.<br>
The exception being that I could not find Bethany's 'Scout' box, I know it *was* there, I have the stamp in my book.<br>
But I could not locate it this time around.<br>
<br>
The stream is very low and there was no evidence that salmon have started to enter. I think we'll have to wait for some steady rain before that happens.<br>
<br>
It also seems that 4 wheel ATV riders have been using the paths as a race course, there were three riders leaving as I entered, like to run me over!<br>
The trails show the scars that riders have been using the trails for awhile.<br>
<br>
This collection of boxes was placed by South Sound L Boxers for the enjoyment of a local scout den, but is open to all.<br>
These boxes should not be missed by those new to the hobby.<br>
