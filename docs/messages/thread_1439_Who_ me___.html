Robin would never been half as much fun without all the people who were there. I'm <br>
sure the newbies had a blast and your presence is what made it extra special. <br>
<br>
When I first heard that Campfire Lady and Pandora had enrolled in this class I was <br>
afraid that I would have little to offer them. Both are already skilled at stamp carving. <br>
Pandora has been producing amazing works of stamp artistry in recent weeks. <br>
However, I found that they were a real asset to the class. The other uninitiated <br>
student got more than one viewpoint on letterboxing and carving and I got immediate <br>
feedback on my class. Fortunately for me, neither had made any stitched books <br>
before. So I was able to introduce then to something entirely new. Phew!!!<br>
<br>
So, many thanks for the kudos and thanks for help send the newbies off with a great <br>
impression of our strange little world of letterboxing. Funhog<br>
