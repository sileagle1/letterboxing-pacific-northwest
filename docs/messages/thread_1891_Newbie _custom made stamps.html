 My question is, is there anywhere to get <br/>
&gt; a stamp made for you...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My local rubberstamping store will custom make a rubberstamp for you <br/>
using your own artwork (this is in West Seattle) They charge as <br/>
little as $12 --it all depends on the size of the stamp-- You might <br/>
check out your local rubberstamp store or scrapbooking store and see <br/>
if they do this.  Or you might check out the local rubberstamping <br/>
store and see if they have a 'storebought' stamp that means something <br/>
to you and your family. I have no problem with people using store-<br/>
bought stamps if the stamp has significance to you.  Then after you <br/>
have gone to some gatherings and seen folks carving...perhaps carved <br/>
a little yourself, then you might carve your own stamp later. :-)<br/>

<br/>
If you have the artwork, you can also go to an engraving shop, probably<br/>
named a trophy store.  They can turn your artwork into a stamp.  They<br/>
engrave the image in plastic and use heat and pressure to make the rubber<br/>
stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy this great pastime, and give stamp carving a try. <br/>
