  My Girl Scout troop is going up to Blaine, WA. to the Canadian Border <br>
to Peace Arch Park on June 11th for the Hands Across the Border all day <br>
event. This will be our Mother/Daughter event for the year. The Peace <br>
Arch event is Sunday. On Saturday I would LOVE to do letterboxing with <br>
my troop. All I can find on City Search is Bellingham that is in that <br>
area and that is further than I would like to go since we will be in <br>
several cars.<br>
<br>
Are there other places to search for boxes that are hidden or are they <br>
all on Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
Anyone in the PNW want to plant a box up North that we can find in <br>
June???<br>
