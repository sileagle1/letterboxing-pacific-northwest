<br>
Iron`Bear and I are planning on taking the I-5 Corridor down to <br>
Northern California on Monday and we have a couple stops scheduled <br>
to pick up some special letterboxes -- we were wondering if anyone <br>
knows of any quick nabs that we should grab on our way so we don't <br>
kick ourselves for passing them up when we get home?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
Source of the Sacramento<br>
Dunsmuir Shasta Shade<br>
Hedge Creek Falls<br>
Craggy Castle (entrance fee & drive up a steep, narrow road required)<br>
<br>
Then a bunch in the Redding area which would require a detour off <br>
299W (or 199W--can't remember right now?) for a few miles--<br>
<br>
Dammed Shasta (6 mile drive one way off I-5)<br>
Queen City Shasta<br>
Glory Hole<br>
<br>
There are a bunch of others, these are just boxes we've planted.<br>
<br>
We also have a box with somewhat of a hike (3 miles roundtrip) <br>
that's quite close to I-5 near Shasta Lake (Packers Bay Overlook).  <br>
It's a great spot to stretch your legs before the long stretch to <br>
Sacramento.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your trip!<br>
