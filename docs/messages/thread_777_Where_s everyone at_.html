Come on friends, lets get together there and give me some feedback on the site, let me know what you want there, get active in the forums, enter your boxes into the Database, tell me what you, the box placers, ant it to do, what features you want.  You've got a chance to create the premier Letterbox Database here, lets exercise that ability.<br>

Registration is required to ensure that no one can just enter a box randomly, and none of your personal information use to register will ever be used by anyone other than the staff members of the PNWLb website and will NEVER be sold or given to any third party.<br>

Speaking of staff members, there is a need for Moderators on the forums, if you are interested, contact either myself or Rayvenmom for details.<br>

I look forward to seeing you there!<br>

Sorry to hear of your wife's troubles and glad that she is doing better.<br>
It doesn't matter how trivial the surgery, it's still !surgery! and has the<br>

You asked for input on your web site............<br>
<br>
In my opinion, it is over kill and unnecessary, we have a forum, actually<br>
two, LbNA and LbPNW.<br>
We have a place to post clues on the LbNA site.<br>
Since we all read either this group, LbPNW or the original LbNA site or<br>
both, we all get the news about letterboxing.<br>
If I want to chat, I'll use the phone.<br>
If you had an interesting experience while letterboxing, post it to the<br>
group, not as a journal entry on another web site.<br>
<br>
Now you are looking for moderators to oversee the day to day processes,<br>

This has all the earmarks of management by committee that, in my experience,<br>

I'll admit I haven't checked out the website, but I haven't really <br>
found a compelling reason to do so, either.  I'm happy and <br>
comfortable with the main letterboxing board, imperfections and all.  <br>
I like having clues for all states in a single location.  I'm sure <br>
you've done a fine job of the site and all, but I don't see it as <br>
filling a need that isn't already available here or on the main <br>
letterboxing board.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
I'd imagine the reason so few people have visited so far are probably <br>
similar--why bother?  Anyone that was really interested has probably <br>
already visited your website.  Anyone else that visits would probably <br>
be "sympathy visits".  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that's <br>
how I see it.<br>
<br>
Of course, you could try to convince me to give up all that I know <br>
and love and explain how your website fills a need that isn't <br>
provided elsewhere....  I don't think I've actually heard your <br>
reasons for creating the site.<br>

  Just my 2 cents...I am a member of your mailing list but dont live in the area so I wont be using the website.  Maybe I will when I visit the area.<br>
<br>
  Maybe your have a lot of members like me who dont live in your area but just want to know whats going on out there.<br>

in the Pacific Northwest existed.  That's all.  Far be it from me to try and<br>
tear you away from that which you love and cherish.  (soft smiles)<br>
<br>
The website is there and will always be there. simple as that.  Anyone who<br>
wants to use it, may do so.  Anyone who does not, does not have to.....<br>
Remember, no rules, right?  It does nothing any other websites or group of<br>
websites does, nor does it do it particularly better. It's just everything<br>
grouped into one place.  Not website and email and other websites, etc, etc.<br>

But, like I said, you want to use it, come on over check it out. You don't<br>
want to use it, then don't.<br>

On the other things, yes, we have a bunch of places.  The idea for this site<br>
came from the repeated postings of people complaining that there was to much<br>
traffic in the LBNa list.  That's all.  The goal of the site is to provide<br>
one common place for Letterboxing. That's all. Not to replace what we<br>
currently have but to add to it in a beneficial way. Have I done so? Time<br>
will tell.<br>
<br>
As far as the 'committee' notion, no way.  This site is created, designed,<br>
developed and maintained by me.  Moderators are people that have a little<br>
bit of extra abilities in the Forums so that they can move messages, answer<br>
questions, in general, help the new people along.<br>
<br>
I'll beg to differ on one point, we don't have a forum, we have an<br>
advertising subsidized mailing list.  Nit picking, I know, but it's my<br>
thoughts on the Yahoo Groups concept.  Don't mean any disrespect by it<br>
either.<br>
<br>
As far as interesting experiences posted to the mailing lists, since that is<br>
a bit of a touchy subject, resulting in a mixed bag of emotional responses<br>
from people on said list, so, I'll mind my P's and Q's in that area, thank<br>
you very much and NOT post my reports (Under whatever name).<br>
