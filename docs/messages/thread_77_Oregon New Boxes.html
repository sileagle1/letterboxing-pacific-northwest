<br>
Directions: The Environmental Learning Center (ELC) at CCC is our <br>
little nitch of forest in our neighborhood. We just call it "the <br>
duck pond". It is a great place to let the kids explore, watch the <br>
turtles sun themselves, and feed the ducks. Parking is free, and the <br>
entrance fee is optional (donation). Take highway 213 to Beavercreek <br>
Road. Turn left and go about .5 miles to the entrance of Clackamas <br>
Community College. Follow the signs to the ELC.<br>
<br>
Clues: Box #1: Turtle Island<br>
 Starting from the front entrance, take the trail left over the rock <br>
road. Cross 3 bridges, always staying to the right. After the 3rd <br>
bridge turn left. Look for a Sacred Pole. Carefully give your <br>
respect to the pole of the Ancient People and there you will find a <br>
gift under its watchful care.<br>
Box #2 Duck Pond<br>
Leaving the pole take the path left. Cross the water and follow the <br>
path to the little footbridge. Turn around. Carefully look under a <br>
loose moss covered stone on the end of the rock wall.  <br>
