don't give me credit for the wonderful stamp by YeeHaw YaYa. She's a<br>
professional jeweler, the winner of national awards. This was her<br>
first rubber stamp (!) but has been carving waxes for jewelry for<br>
ages. I'm sorry the one has gone missing as it was a cool stamp too.<br>
Maybe I can get YumYum to do another. <br>
<br>
I am so surprised that more folks haven't visited these boxes. In my<br>
opinion, this is one of the most beautiful places in the Cascades. I<br>
always feel as though I'm in some Merchant Ivory film when I'm at the<br>
Head of the Metolius on a clear Spring day. <br>
<br>
I failed to get the lava cave stamp because I was traveling alone that<br>
day. I had three flashlights with me but no one knew I was there and I<br>
just felt a little hinky about going into that cave alone. Many thanks<br>
for the update. Funhog<br>

  We kinda figured that you either ran out of time or were alone.  We got to the lava tube at about 3:30 and were told that we could only go half way to return the lantern by 4pm.  We raced thru since we knew that we still had to do a search in the dark and the return trip and totally understood your being hinky about it, the path was pretty rough in places and we worried that in our rush one of us would end up spraining an ankle or worse.  We got there found it and got the lantern back just as they were ready to close up - they had traded a lantern for a drivers license.  We wanted the license back.  Then we discovered that you could go in on your own with proper lighting and no fee after hours, but of course we left our headlights at the camesite!  Poor planning on our part to save a buck and have more time.  They said it takes an average of 1 1/2 hours - we did it in less than half the time.  And still enjoyed the "sites"<br>
