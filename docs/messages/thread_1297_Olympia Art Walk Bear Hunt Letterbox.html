been posted today. Arts Walk is a celebration of the local arts <br/>
community by artists, businesses, and the City of Olympia Arts <br/>
Commission. Arts Walk kicks off from 5 til 10 tomorrow night and <br/>
continues Saturday from 2 til 9 -- including the 10th Annual <br/>
Procession of the Species at 5:30. It's a free event which includes <br/>
nearly 100 exhibits as well as street performers, music, dance, <br/>
theater, and family hands-on art activities throughout the city of <br/>
Olympia. For information call Olympia's Parks, Arts, and Recreation <br/>
Department at 360.709.2678. Or check out the Procession web page at <br/>
http://www.procession.org/. The Procession has been referred to as <br/>
the Mardi Gras of the NW. Do I get paid in any way for any of this? <br/>
No. Like many of you, I am always looking for something new and fun <br/>
to do and the Spring Arts Walk and Procession is always a good time. <br/>
