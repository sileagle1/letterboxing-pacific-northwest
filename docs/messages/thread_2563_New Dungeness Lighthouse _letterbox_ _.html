Howdy Y'all,<br>
<br>
Had a great weekend out on the northern Olympic Peninsula <br>
(Sequim/Port Angeles area). There are a ton of cool boxes out there, <br>
some older, some pretty new.<br>
<br>
One of the highlights was hiking out to the end of Dungeness Spit. <br>
It's about 10-11 miles roundtrip, and took us about 5.5 hours with <br>
stops for rests, food, and bird watching. It's flat, and the sand is <br>
good walking if it's low tide, or at least below about 4 ft (check <br>
www.saltwatertides.com).<br>
<br>
There are free lighthouse tours at the tip between 9am-4pm, which was <br>
a real treat. Also, next to the visitor's log, there are two very <br>
nice custom-made (but not hard carved) stamps featuring the <br>
lighthouse. I didn't bring my own logbook, but there was paper there <br>
for stamping. As I understand it, a letterbox is anything with a <br>
logbook, a stamp, and a clue -- and it often involves some mental <br>
and/or physical challenge. The New Dungeness Lighthouse has ALL of <br>
those things - well, except the clue, which I am providing right here <br>
in the form of this message. So I logged it as a find! =) <br>
<br>
Anyhow, check out Sequim/Port Angeles area if you get the chance. And <br>
if you decide to hike the Spit, check the tides, pack food and water, <br>
and bring your logbook and ink pad!<br>
