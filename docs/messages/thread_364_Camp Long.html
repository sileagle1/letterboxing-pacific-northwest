those, "if I have spare time" boxes that I never got.<br/>
<br/>
I remember a report a few months ago that said box was missing.  We <br/>
are missing some of our placers too.  Jill the Reckless has a few <br/>
boxes n the area that have great stamps.  i don't think we have heard <br/>
from her in a while.  Was this one of hers?  If so we lost a great <br/>
stamp.<br/>

I think she was a friend of Jill the Reckless. The name on the Camp <br/>
Long clues is Kathy H. I think Eliza B got a couple of her <br/>
artist/rubberstamp folks together and they planted Camp Long, Mee Kwa <br/>
Oks (sp?) and Little Lord Fauntleroy. (they are all over here in West <br/>
Seattle) The artwork was terrific. But we have not heard from these <br/>
folks again!<br/>
