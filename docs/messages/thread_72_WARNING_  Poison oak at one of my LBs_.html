College in Oregon City--and horrors!--discovered many poison oak plants <br>
around #3.  Shoot!  You can still get to the box by going in via the side <br>
closest the road rather than that nearer the trail--BUT--if you don't know <br>
what poison oak looks like, don't go after #3 (or...if you want to learn what <br>
it looks like, check out #3 ;-).   I'll have to find a new hiding place.  <br>
Meanwhile, I'll plan to post some sort of warning sign there for those who <br>
don't read this list.<br>
