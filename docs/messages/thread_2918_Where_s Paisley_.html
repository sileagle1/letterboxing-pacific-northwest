I've responded several times to your e-mails.  I still have my <br/>
paisleyorca@webtv.net address, as well as paisleyorca@yahoo.com.  We <br/>
can't make it the weekend of July 18/19/20 because of other <br/>
commitments.  Hope all is well with you and the local letterboxing <br/>
community.  Thanks for thinking of us!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
