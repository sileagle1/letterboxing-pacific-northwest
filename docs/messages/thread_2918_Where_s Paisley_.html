I've responded several times to your e-mails.  I still have my <br>
paisleyorca@webtv.net address, as well as paisleyorca@yahoo.com.  We <br>
can't make it the weekend of July 18/19/20 because of other <br>
commitments.  Hope all is well with you and the local letterboxing <br>
community.  Thanks for thinking of us!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
